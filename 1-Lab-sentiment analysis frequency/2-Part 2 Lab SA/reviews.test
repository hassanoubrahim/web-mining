__label__4 i love this app it makes my day to day so much more organized and pretty it allows you to keep a check on your daily water intake your to do lists grocery lists events whatever you have in mind i find that the layout of it all helps me to maintain productivity i only wish there were a widget available
__label__2 the basic app is fine not great but fine however the premium is far too pricey 27 a year for the ability to set a duration on tasks that's crazy
__label__2 the app is good but the differences between the premium and free version aren't mentioned at the beginning it is also not possible to start using the app without the free trial period as far as i have seen after the forced free trial period i now realize that the sync function which enables you to use pc and and app simultaneously is indeed a premium function this seems awful lot like the way evernote took i want to buy my apps because i appreciate the work not because i'm forced into
__label__3 hi please provide accepted pending decline tags on rutine notifications of activites and also show day progress for these tags or activites in app i think it will force the mind to follow daily schedule
__label__1 seriously reminder is a premium feature what's the point of all this then 1 star i can understand comments and labels but reminders at least other paid apps give reminders
__label__1 todoist is garbage nevermind the idiotic text based method for creating daily tasks this stupid app seems to think every day is a suggestion even with premium been using this app for three weeks every few days it refuses to renew my daily tasks scheduled reminders disappear curse blast whoever eol'd wunderlist cuz it was perfect for my needs this todoist trash not at all i will cling to wunderlist until the very end
__label__5 i love this app but the only problem is that i am not able to buy trees at all when i click on th tree i want to purchase there is a pop up saying that the app crashed added later i did that before but it did not work and now i have 2531 seeds and it's kinda nice to look at all the seeds and now i am satisfied with my 3 plants thisappissuitableformytabletplaystoresaidthat'swhyit'snotworkingformebutihaveuseditinmydadsphineandworksamazinglyirecommenditforsureiamwritingwithoutspacecozofwordlimi
__label__5 the best to do list app i've used to date i'd used a lot before without any luck i'm glad to say i don't think i'll be looking for any other apps now
__label__2 i used todoist premium for about 6 years but i must say that it has gone down over the years there are so many features missing compared to other similar apps which are either free or charge much less for their premium version the new major update feels like a complete let down with absolutely no new features other than now being able to see subtasks in the parent task dialog box still no kanban view no native calendar view limited to no sorting options just to name a few i'm sorry but dabbing a bit of color on icons or adding a color name next to a color do not qualify as new features i left todoist for ticktick a couple of months ago and have not looked back
__label__3 love it but it has some major flaws 1 can't personalize theme 2 can't configurate widgets' toolbars what details are displayed 3 the widget's size is too wide max 4x would love it if it were more flexible 4 you cannot sort the notes on one day to be listed in alphabetical order on the day widget it will always be sorted by time 5 the app malfunctions when you place two widgets on the home screen 6 app stops working a lot for seemingly no reason
__label__2 after update i couldn't log in to my google account the button allow wasn't working after applying the workaround and setting an email in web version my app on the phone requested permissions to my contacts i allowed it the pop up in the app did not disappear after pressing 'ok' several times it went away however now the app doesn't fetch the information from the cloud i wanted to buy pro not anymore you can't fix the bug with google account for several months now embarrassing
__label__1 sometimes it doesnt count the money inside i felt so frustrated because my effort doesn't convert into money
__label__2 widget freezes app does not sync i had a galaxy s7 edge and just got an s10 app fails with both phones regret spending money on this
__label__1 a hidden wonderful music comment and feedback is correct please do it like previous it was
__label__3 generally pretty good but a lot of awkward design choices no compact mode inefficient use of colors for organization difficulty selecting and moving tasks lack of icon consistency preset snooze and reminder time options rather than being able to choose them yourself
__label__1 when i share a list with someone over messenger or sms just the name of the list is shared not the actual list with an ability to collaborate
__label__3 it doesnt update between your calanders i need a planner that stays up to date with my calendar changes this is not it waste of money
__label__2 the splash screen says the account is free forever but to have reminder of events tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its 3 per month that's quite misleading response to the developer thank you for responding the main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature best wishes with the app
__label__2 good but the paid version did not work as i wanted to use it more so i was disappointed
__label__3 makes a less than good first impression on new users by makng word input as scheduling as cryptic as possible and having no undo for marking things done or way of looking up what you accidentally marked as done a pain in the neck in many ways
__label__2 some my tasks and habits dissappear there aren't any in completed
__label__4 this app is great overall i just wish there were categories for your inventory items and that the task list widget showed your profile icon also the profile icon has very bad quality when you choose your own
__label__5 i love habitica i am particularly bad at getting things done and this app has helped me improve so much it's as it says gamifying your tasks i am on level 12 and i have only been doing it for a week if you need a pick me up with your chores and todo lists then check it out
__label__2 it's a true mystery of life how microsoft can take anything and make it look ugly and needlessly complicated why on earth would they not simply leave wunderlist as is so they see nothing wrong and decide time to wreck it who is going to save us when they finally shut wunderlist down
__label__4 made outlook play nicely by just importing my outlook calendars to google calendar so that was pretty easy really i love the widget on my phone it looks good works nicely it's awesome the phone clockface however can't be configured i can't find any option to add my business calendar and some shared calendars to the clock face it seems to only show my primary calendar which apart from my own birthday is completely emtpy i'm aware that on android one can select calendars they just don't reflect over to the android watchface
__label__5 very good app easy to use and has a great interface very easy to follow and set up all of your daily plans
__label__1 i love it except and this is a big issue for me it's totally server based want to update anything but have a bad internet connection too bad it's either going to take forever or fail i would use and maybe even pay for this app to just have a way to have everything first be saved on my device so back to hunting for a to do app edit 3 23 i have to drop my review on this to 1 star you can manually edit values within the app for stats making any it unreasonable that i need internet
__label__2 the application is very nive but cant take the complete use of it because of the premium option and the amount also is high
__label__1 this app is completely unusable on my note10 the account creation is riddled with errors and when i finally get into the app i can't click on any items or add a new item without the app instantly crashing i was excited by the premise and motivated to start using it but the experience was downright embarrassing i'd love for a developer response here to acknowledge these problems and maybe offer some solutions
__label__2 i'm sure it would be great if it didn't pick and chose what events to display from my calendar i have multiple events logged in my calendar the only calendar it's synced to and the only calendar those events are logged on yet just one of them shows up it has a lovely design but that doesn't mean anything when the app doesn't actually work for what it's intended for
__label__1 worst app doesn't work
__label__2 wunderlist was better now i have to push more buttons than before dont even know how to prioitize a task when i add it why not leave it the way it was and just brand it ms
__label__4 app has definitely improved since my last review more social features would be really cool i am subscribed and i would love to see where this app takes off i have noticed recent stability issues when i'm on the app for a prolonged period not sure if it's related to the amount of tasks i have as i use this app for basically all my tasks including birthdays the app will slow down and nearly crash after awhile otherwise this is still my go to 4 stars again
__label__1 can't assign to multiple people verry bad
__label__4 easy to use really helps keeping me on top of things
__label__5 so far so good for me
__label__4 nice
__label__3 we need an update i love this app and use it daily but the fact that we haven't had an update in months bothers me here are some suggestions i have add a settings option to default the amount of time you spend on a task i use 45 min more color options for tasks an option to change the notification sounds for each entry a 'push all back an hour' option and more widget options thank you i love this app but we could definitely use some upgrades
__label__1 i was aiming for a 30 day streak lately unfortunately as i pressed the plant button i wasn't able to plant i kept pressing the button but it wasn't responding this shattered my record
__label__1 not working in samsung phones though i bought a premium app
__label__4 i've tried quite a few rpg like to do list apps and i must say this one is the only one that i find genuinely enjoyable and actually kinda feels like a game you can tell a lot of effort was put into the aesthetic everything is very easy to access and is pleasing to the eye although i think there should be a way to uncheck to do's i keep accidentally clicking on them in the widget and remaking them every time is starting to get annoying
__label__3 when you start a habit with giving points for it or like at least that and that amount of days you can't just change it back to a simple yes and no habit
__label__1 useless it keeps erasing everything you have to dominate the app it should be easy
__label__3 why would i pay money to have recurring events in a planner i think i'll stick with my default calander app
__label__4 this app is really functional and helpful the widget is great caveat you can only track seven habits without paying it's one time five bucks and worth it though suggestion to the developer make checked off habits go to the bottom of the list so we can see what we haven't done yet more easily
__label__4 like it a little even bought the pro version but when i went to the website trying to find out how do you back up your data in the event something happens to your phone
__label__3 the current release doesn't sync appoinments i make in the app to my google calendar it only copies the online calendar events to the app
__label__3 for change the colors we have to pay no thanks uninstall process
__label__1 app is awesome but in this no login facility and assign task
__label__4 it's a bit hard to set everything up but it's a fun new concept for the typical agenda that encourages you a bit more to achieve your goals through a rpg style nice work dev team thanks for your time and effort
__label__1 excellent app highly recommend have been using this app since it was first getting established and was advertised on reddit however i cant log on anymore i had access on my old phone and now on my new one it says my email address is not in the database how can i get my access back this is the only app i like
__label__1 i click undo but retain the xp no real theme or this app very bland needs character
__label__5 really nice overview like the colors and how adjustable it is won't consider any other calendar app
__label__2 if u want to study you need to plan don't use apps
__label__3 this app is good but it will be extra good if the developer put an option to continous timing for focus i believe there should not be any kind of limit like 10 min remove it or give an option to set custom time in hour and minute
__label__1 good on paper tried it out and off the bat wouldn't sync any news items wish it had an option to at least input items directly either way didnt work
__label__3 need to be able to repeat tasks if it had that i'd be my new calendar
__label__3 to do huh yeah well hell yeah join the team everyone else has check in at etc etc now back to american terrorism the way i see it hamilton
__label__1 the font is too small for me to read with no way to change it
__label__3 i like this better then the calendar that comes on my phone but it's too pricey i dont mind paying for an app i like or paying for the downloads i want in an app but you cant justify this price for what you get
__label__4 good app with notifications for reminding you and helping you track your progress
__label__3 difficult to use and doesn't show name of activity only when i click on it
__label__3 it was essential to me until the last updates
__label__5 awesome
__label__3 it's such a bummer it doesn't work on the samsung sport watch
__label__5
__label__4 good visual reminder and nice to see patterns of habit breaking
__label__4 great simple app notifications can be better they pop out irrespective of whether goal was achieved and thus are useless
__label__3 i like it a lot and also not a lot i like the way it looks once the tasks are created but i dislike creating the tasks using the current interface 4 comments 1 i have the full version with whatsapp linked and it causes duplicate reminders 2 the widgets are not recognized by my homescreen replacement app go launcher 3 i would like to be able to resize the fonts and spacing 4 creating tasks via whatsapp or google assistant is very limited in its possibilities and often erroneous
__label__1 charged for subscription after cancelling trial and not even using the app
__label__1 account gets blocked after 1 day happened twice with different mail addresses only possibility to solve is to give the mobile phone number won't do that
__label__5 this app is great for staying on task the interface allows you to leave and access your documents while still allowing you to have your focus timer on this app is so awesome i genuinely love this app i hope that more people would download and experience its greatness
__label__4 so now that you're microsoft please expand basic features like button to create a task from the main screen i want to start recording my task prior to selecting a list or any other options allow hard press on task to see options rather than having to go in each to make changes after creation provide 'separation' function so i can group items on the same list no overly complicated group option required
__label__3 too many features are premium and that's kinda annoying still like the app though
__label__1 not a stand alone app must use calendar on mobile my pout was to use it on its own
__label__1 app no longer supported data loss likely was a great app until i needed to migrate to a new phone the sync feature never worked and i lost months of habit data i tried contacting the developer via the supplied email but zero response i used to recommend this app to many people but i'm done with it
__label__1 while using the habbit feature you can add multiple reminders for drinking water but if you check done in any one of those reminders then it wont remind for the rest of the day ruins the logic uninstalled installed a year later and still the issue exists the habit feature was a unique point which brought me to the app but i guess i'll have to use another one
__label__5 nice
__label__5 highly recommended super easy way to live an organised and healthy life and to be the person you want to be
__label__3 love the app but i have a question in the options under daily tasks we can choose between daily or weekly what's the difference
__label__4 nice apps but need to re download the full version
__label__2 doesn't sync with google calendar the one thing it's supposed to do and it failed
__label__3 i had to pay for the option to change the colours then i had to pay more to customise it further exploitative money grabbing like this ensures i'll never recommend it to anyone else works well though
__label__5 i got taks to replace todoist later i deleted tasks and went back to todoist still not happy i brought back tasks and now run both apps side by side on my phone perfect solution todoist carries the heavyweight must do daily work load i refer to it two maybe three times a day but tasks is there to be fleet of foot and versatile a quick list here a few to dos there adding to and ticking off right throughout the day that is my way but tasks would be a great stand alone app too
"__label__3 app is okay but the ui is really outdated there is almost no elements of 
material design in this app have a look at an app like airbnb how they 
nicely used material design sleek and beautiful"
__label__5 love it and i use it every day
__label__2 every entry gets copied so i end up with 2 of everything one in the color i designate and the other in the standard color if i delete 1 i loose both i used this calendar for years for my business and loved it but the latest update killed it
__label__5 this app can really improve your life
__label__3 the widget goes blank every now and then it displays just empty grey spaces instead of my tasks
__label__4 great app i would like more progression content resetting levels is easy implementation but gets stale quickly mages do too much damage but this app had been transformative and amazing i will consider contributing to development
__label__4 great app the app offers very interesting and unique features as well but there is only one problem for people like myself i spend most of my time doing some work on my laptop and i try as much as i can to ignore my cellphone whilst working if only i could manipulate and change my schedule in timetune accordingly on my laptop or pc it would be perfect
__label__1 looked good but wasn't after installing tasks my keyboard stopped appearing for all my apps it was only when i removed tasks as a last resort that the keyboard appeared again
__label__4 good but need some options more such as when you make one habit in different day at different time her can't help you
__label__3 first time and first day was everyting amazing but the next day for several time it showed the connection error message i loved everyting in the app very visual and fun so when this issue gets fixed i will come back to give more stars
__label__5 so efficient
__label__3 ok
__label__4 i've been using this app for some weeks now there are still some features that i don't understand and there's just so much available for customisation that it's overwhelming but once i spent a few hours customizing all i wanted this app has been so fun and useful most to do list apps out there are so cumbersome and anxiety inducing this one isn't it has helped me prioritize what's important to me while letting me role play i like it a lot
__label__5 its awesome time management base app
__label__3 needs a widget once it has multiple different widgets calendar to do list grocery list etc i might revisit it
__label__1 where is the alarm tone setting in this
"__label__3 idk wht hppen but every time i open the app it stated tht the app hs been 
blocked by system idk y btw im using oppo f1s"
__label__2 very buggy and doesn't always show whole pages or lists
__label__5 i'm actually willing to pay for the app just please get the server issue resolved seriously charge one dollar for the app get a bigger dev team and resolve any bugs or server issues the app is actually great aside from that constructive feedback
__label__3 has potential but i need it for the programer which costs money
__label__3 awesome app but hate the new placement of the buttons when you use to create a task you clicked under the title to select when you wanted a reminder now it's halfway down the page i keep hitting share task and it takes forever to back out of that screen
__label__3 not for me
__label__1 even after several updates the problem persists despite adding and sceduling tasks the calender inside the app isnt showing any tasks at all no tasks visible at all in the in app calendar view in the calendar widget however i can see tasks arranged datewise honestly yours is a really nice app with features but what's the point to having them if they don't work in the first place
__label__1 sir i already did all step but i still face notification ringing problem
__label__3 it says i changed my password and now can't get in calendar what can i do to fix problems
__label__4 i guess i love it as it kind of works i mean this is as good as an app can get for it's purpose it has the perfect amount of features and completely customizable the biggest problem i have is at the beginning it's very challenging to keep alive as you have no party armour yet and also as far as i'm aware i could only edit the order of the dailies i wish they can be done to other sectors too
__label__2 i really like the app online portal but having everything in one does me no good w o push notifications i wish this had a widget so i didn't have to open the app to look at everything i paid for this i don't feel like i got my investment back as i maybe use the app once in a blue moon it looks great but it just doesn't work to what i feel is it's full protein i hope you add this don't make me pay for it
__label__4 this app is great and i'm sticking to it the only issue i have with it is the notification it doesn't work when the app is closed please fix that
__label__5 very cool app using it for real life stuff as if it's a video game is so fun could have some bug tweaks and possibly an overhaul for the interface but it's still close to perfect and runs great
__label__1 i couldn't register the circle rounds and rounds and nothing happens
__label__4 great app verry helpfull and can be improved more
__label__1 i bought the premium version and it will not sync i have snet numerous requests to support and have received no responses
__label__1 no outlook calendar support most business people use outlook
__label__5 great app for doing work it will keep you focused and it really works just try it if you dont believe great work team you guys created a marvelous app which worth 5 5
__label__2 i love this app but it reads my texts i left one in draft and it suggested it as a todo item i couldn't find any way to get it to keep is eyes to itself not about it
__label__1 wow a to do list app without the option to make your tasks recurring i won't lie i am absolutely baffled that this is omitted maybe it's in the web version or the ios version but i'll never know you tick a date in the calendar and where is the tick box for 'repeat every xxx' maybe it's a premium feature i guess i'll never know that either
__label__3 if you can't add subtasks everything else in the app is quite impressive except this i added a project and it disappeared from my projects tab and i couldn't add any subtasks to it so it is indistinguishable from a regular task
__label__3 took more than 3 years but they've finally managed to get bc2 to a similar perhaps even better level than the original 3 10 2019 update unfortunately usability is severely compromised busy calendars are almost unreadable unless in day view tap to create appointment can drop you in very strange time slots 10 05 or 14 40 clock to set times is backward step from bc1 which is by far the best way to set times on a calendar i like the auto link to contacts in bc2 2 line favorites bar pls
__label__3 i had my progress save on another phone is there no way to get it transferred to my new one
__label__4 it's wonderful but when i download it last time it doesn't sign in there is a big problem i do not know what to do
__label__3 kinda good
__label__3 loved todoist but the new widget is a massive step backward for me can't multiselect and reschedule multiple tasks anymore
__label__4 nice but please give option to add different time intervals for habits for example i want to develop habit of drinking water and want the reminder to come at multiple particular times a day the app allows only one specific time for the reminder so please add the mentioned feature
__label__5 needs a recipe section and separate lists for different members of family
__label__3 good app but needs to add daily to do list
"__label__2 u should work on the phones like oppo and others so that customer don't 
find problem"
__label__1 total waste of money
__label__2 can't adjust center clock size can't open alarms by touching the center clock the image for opening the app on the play store doesn't represent what you can customize the clock to look like as a widget augh cool but lacking necessary functions edit i was not able to click the center clock and open my alarms not sure why but the developer said it is possible
__label__5 the best habit tracking app i've ever used set your own goals no comments that make you feel guilty and minimal annoying reminders
__label__5 this app really helps it makes me organized in what i need to do especially when i am going out to go to the supermarket and buy stuffs
__label__4 i have tied a few calenders this one is good for multiple accounts easy to turn them off and on its quite clear on a phone screen
__label__2 i don't appreciate changing away from wunderlist like hello where is my calendar functionality should be even easier to do when everything is the same suite also my dear wunderlist rip you died too soon
__label__3 taking stars off because no swipe options that's just so bad sorry to see that get back to your previous designs please
__label__5 this is the best productivity app i have ever used and i'll keep using it it is so simple and intuitive with useful reminders that keep you on track the only option that is missing in my opinion is to set alarms not only reminders for tasks that can go on few hours before other than that it's 5 stars all day long thanks guys
__label__3 makes a less than good first impression on new users by makng word input as scheduling as cryptic as possible and having no undo for marking things done or way of looking up what you accidentally marked as done a pain in the neck in many ways
__label__2 i hate how you cannot open the app and see all your lists there you have to have one open at all times and it does not show a list of your list on the home screen deleting this app for this reason too bad the rest is great but they need a home screen they don't have one
__label__5 suggestion in my one of task status of the task progressing stage is very important to us so please to add the feature in it example 60 completed in task manually user mention or drag the percentage bar in his task it will be useful to us thank you to do team
__label__2 the interface is very nice and simple however once i got down to using it and setting some tasks five tasks total about an hour later i went back to the app to make edits but instead saw the list of tasks that i have set were deleted if the app has an issue saving the tasks it needs to be fixed i will change the rating once that bug is resolved
__label__4 it is the perfect app for me when it comes to tasks habits however it would've been nice to if you can add sound when i mark a task complete
__label__3 i like it paying month after month for premium features isn't for me though
__label__5 organized
__label__1 i just removed this app i missed several events in the last couple of months because it did not notify me
__label__5 helps me used to use pomodoro but the forest theme is nice and sort of mindful i also use it for breaks from my phone
__label__5 this app really helps it makes me organized in what i need to do especially when i am going out to go to the supermarket and buy stuffs
__label__3 neat concept just not for me
__label__1 i have been wanting to try out this app for a while i registered and everything is going great until i get to the character maker screen i am unable to see my charcter and the customization options will send photos if needed will change rating once this is fixed
__label__2 it was good until they introduced long adverts every time you add an entry how to annoy your users i won't be forced to pay i have given good feedback in the past and good feedback encourages others to pay now you have decided to make the free version really annoying to use you are creating bad feedback good luck
__label__1 it's says error when copying data when i tried to export data can you please mail me the solution again please
__label__4 great updates nice color nice experience pro version is better wished more was free need quick add tasks see tick tick needs folders and a pomo timer would be awesome thanks for adding sort and categories
__label__5 really good app and well built with nice user interface they also have good customer service and they replyed quickly to my earlier review where i was experiencing a problem at first
__label__3 paid the 2 99 for the calendar sync as i really needed that and found that it didn't work however they quickly refunded my money and the issue may have been with the compatibility of my phone
__label__5 it is good aap for making daily routine chart it help us for work and remind important
__label__3 easy to use but lacks neccessary functionality to make it really useful needs to be able to pull thorough tasks into my day based on 'repeat' and 'due date' rather than having to maually add to my day
__label__2 the ads on this app are cancerous and the subscription model for this type of app is ludicrous charge a single flat rate if the style does change to flat rate ad free i'll gladly change my review
__label__1 the two starting pages were blank same as character customization i saw another comment and there's any new version to update i was excited to try this app but i couldn't
__label__2 i like the idea but it's not working with outlook calendar properly this a big drawback for me
__label__5 great intuitive and easy to use
__label__1 hello the app keeps disappearing from my notifications i already allowed notification access and persistent notification on my settings i also whitelisted the app on my battery saver but it still doesn't work help please
__label__4 the ios app is lot better than this please improve it as soon as possible
__label__1 this could be an awesome app it has great potential except for a few flaws that end up making it a super irritating app i have reported these issues to the app's tech support several times only to get lame responses with no resolutions the latest being that when items are entered into a category in this app the app for some reason resorts the sequence of items in my list automatically i put these items in the list in a certain order for a reason i have other issues but no moreroomher
__label__1 i've been using this app for a month now everything was fine until today when i opened it to change something and it deleted all my data from the app and from the phone calendar too i'm highly disappointed and really upset since i lost all my data
__label__5 was inspired by the novel solo leveling and it works
__label__5 very good
__label__4 i like this app because it fits well in my daily routines and offers very many settings especially regarding appearance it has some basic design flaws and misses some easy opportunities but all in all it is a valuable application for my personal time management
__label__5 user friendly nice
__label__1 app crashes
__label__3 good but need some improvements some times completed task show in to fo list
__label__4 this app is great so far but i wish there was an option to select several days at a time for each routine if there is already pls let me know
__label__4 the feature of able to detect time label projects on what i typed when editing tasks within inbox is now being removed auto detection still available on adding new tasks though please consider to put it back
__label__3 nice but not what i need for now
__label__5 excellent app well thought features so far in my experience with a few task apps earlier i can say this is the best thanks and all the best to the team editing the review to add this i have upgraded to premium version in the last few days of my trial this app has substantially increased my productivity considering the benefits satisfaction of completing tasks without missing them the paid subscription is more than justified thank you
__label__2 fair enough for ads but now the widget isn't showing anything anymore it's just blank i've set up all events and schedule and it's still blank
__label__2 فقط احتاج ان اضغط عليه لاري باقي النتيجة ثم يعود لما كان عليه مرة اخري
__label__3 before this l used wunderlist solely for my do listn i used workflowy for ongoing notes and events throughout the years i ike this app but if you don't get everything done yesterday's then my day iwhen you wake up the next day my day is blank imagine making to do list on a posted note and the next morning it was blank that's not saving me time don't know why they didn't put that in when developing the app
__label__5 the app is really great and don't even need the paid version unlike what people said i found it quite easy to set up i wish the custom repeat had option to choose which day of the week and not the frequency of days as my schedule varies schema as 4 days a followed by 3 days b i really love the widget option also i just downloaded it but if i keep using it then i will consider buying the pro version to support the creators
__label__3 sometimes the app will just stop working or the widgets won't work
__label__1 spam malware adds scamming events to your calendar upd no it came from your app i never had this problem for 5 years but after installing this application i do
__label__5 nice
__label__5 i've tried several rpg to do lists but this one is the best out of them all it contains all of the features you need to motivate yourself to get off your butt and do something in your life especially during this period of quarantine read the user guide in settings after installing to understand how it works and get to it a big thanks to developer for their quick responses
__label__2 no easy way to import or export tasks in a non proprietary other app e g google tasks compatible format
__label__3 great app but fix the damn widgets it keeps on glitching
__label__3 add all tasks as it was in wunderlist
__label__4 was a great app until android screwed up the notifications or else it would have received five stars but i no longer get notices when i need them so i might have to find another solution
__label__1 the new notifications are atrocious the don't follow light or dark theme in android 10 they don't work well with wear os and they turn on my screen when i don't want them to i'm now getting reminder pop ups when i don't want any and the option to turn them off is gone 10 24 2019 i downgraded to v5 2 3 and got the reminder pop ups option in settings notifications back when i update to 5 3 0 the reminder pop ups option is replaced with notifications and notification font options
__label__3 it works but i can't sync my goals with my tablet
__label__1 used to be simple well organized app latest update was a major step backwards and makes it unusable and completely unreliable do not trust them with your data most of my prior history of completed tasks disappeared for some reason timed ones seemed to stick around completed tasks are now automatically hidden and lose any order you had them in if you ever care to reference completed tasks in any structure this app is not for you it's a hot mess now for that and their backups do not include completed tasks they claim all your information is backed up securely but when i asked for my completed tasks they were not able to provide my attachments
__label__5 excellent tool to organize tasks in multiple lists thank you for developing it a few more features would be helpful such as synching the scheduled tasks with google or outlook calendar moving set of tasks from one list to another saving and restoring to an online account or preferably to an excel sheet or a csv etc it is working wonders for me in the current form however would love to have these on the top good luck and thanks again
__label__1 why should i pay for an app of which i haven't installed huh
__label__5 useful app i like it
__label__4 how can i open pomo timer
__label__1 it's notification tune is frequency low
__label__4 o app é bastante funcional e cumpre o prometido acho que seria interessante ter features que integrem serviços como um calendário ou seja agendamos uma tarefa e isso irá constar no calendário escolhido isso evita ter que abrir dois apps pra ver os afazeres do dia precisa de tema dark no modo web
__label__4 please make an option to use the old style widget unfortunartely letters became too small for 4x6 home screen grid
__label__3 it is amazing app it was working great a week ago but i don't know why from this week it doesn't count the time properly for example if i studied 4hours it only shows 1hour but overall i really like to study when i use this app i hope they fix the bug soon
__label__4 bullet should be in front of the first line of the paragraph not in front of the middle of the paragraph
__label__1 half of stuff is paid reminder is something basic with notes if this is not free whats use of app
__label__2 ad a few widget customisations and i'll give a another star or two chose between dark or light and let us set transparency so we can match it to other widgets that would be great
__label__3 so so not as intuitive right off but fine after a little of fiddling around but the free version only tracks 5 habits and i dont love it enough to see the value in paying for it since there are other apps out there that satisfy the same thing
__label__2 so you reskinned liferpg what's different here
__label__4 it would be a very good choice for those who want a daily base motivation to make your way to build on the habbit try not to break the streak of your habbit goals at any cost from which you can gain the max from this app well built interface with motivational images loved it
__label__5 good way to keep in touch with actions works well with planners
__label__1 i kept getting empty screens when opening the app so i pressed skip filled out the registry info and was taken to character creation where i couldn't see my character or the build options i could select things like body or hair but nothing appeared relating to that
__label__3 user friendly steps and groups are smart features options for repeat reminder are comprehensive love the colors suggestions 1 retain theme color for task so when opening planned easier to distunguish which tasks are under acads orgs etc 2 a better font style for tasks 3 planned please classify next week to specific days it will also be great if i will be able to move tasks from today to tuesday next week with a press hold and swipe automatically updates the due date
__label__3 pop up notification alarm with voice is not available please do needful check to do reminder it will help you to make your app improve
__label__4 this is the app which i use for almost a year there is one issue i have faced recently namely some tasks and events do not synchronize on multiple devices where i installed the app i'm using this app on my android smartphone as well as on ipad i would be very pleased if you fix it
__label__1 horrible so many steps set a due date set a reminder set it to display in my day the reminder set screen is 2 different screens for date time the my day section is the only way you can organize by reminder time for scheduling purposes once it's in my day you must manually move the items in time sequence takes up way too much time to organize your day importing did not work after several attempts the setting reset themselves to default after i set them
__label__1 useful features ask you to get premium version but when i try i get to this page which is the app i already have installed 1 5
__label__5 the best
__label__2 looking as everyone else's very ve reviews i seem to be the odd one out but i didn't find it straightforward it is too easy to delete a list on my s9 at least with even a slight bit of a swipe once deleted it is lost why not have a 'back' or 'undo' button personally i don't find the heading group list structure particularly straightforward although i've now got used to it
__label__1 wow a to do list app without the option to make your tasks recurring i won't lie i am absolutely baffled that this is omitted maybe it's in the web version or the ios version but i'll never know you tick a date in the calendar and where is the tick box for 'repeat every xxx' maybe it's a premium feature i guess i'll never know that either
__label__2 so far the app is great would get 5 stars if it had a tabbing feature where you can side over to each task name instead of having to go to the menu button to switch
__label__4 i've been using this app for some weeks now there are still some features that i don't understand and there's just so much available for customisation that it's overwhelming but once i spent a few hours customizing all i wanted this app has been so fun and useful most to do list apps out there are so cumbersome and anxiety inducing this one isn't it has helped me prioritize what's important to me while letting me role play i like it a lot
__label__3 seems like it could have been great for me however lack of ability to modify repeating schedule e g which days of the week is a blocker switched to habithub for now
__label__2 app not bad but very limited unless you pay downloaded this app after reading in the news about it's whatsapp integration that is only available if you pay without the paid for aspects this application is like any other generic calender app
__label__5 phenomenal
__label__1 my events show up at the wrong time in my calendar even when they've been manually entered what's the point of a planner that doest let you plan
__label__3 its great productivity app but not the one that motivates me or to fun to use personally the game theme is cool but not the one i like i like the original task apps better with all neat features since this one doesn't really have any
__label__2 very disappointed it kept crashing i installed it back twice but it would delete previous trees i loved the concept but these app didn't work for me
__label__1 you need to pay it's uselles without paying seriously just 9 list for free if you need more list just add them in wunderlist and then import them to this app or better stick with todo from microsoft it's free
__label__3 question really interface so far seems pleasant enough does it work with google assistant
__label__4 very useful very easy to use
__label__3 irrespextive of having task completed there should be a way of having access to your do list as long as it is not deleted one might want to crosscheck a few sruffs they should fix that issue
__label__4 good app
__label__1 its most timewasting app instead i downloaded this for schedule n it asks to buy a pro version for it it should be mentioned first before we dwnld this app
__label__4 this is a really useful app for managing multiple to do lists
__label__3 the app was awesome but it stopped working in a week i'm not able to add any routine now
"__label__3 i like that it is easy and convenience which is what i'm looking for but i 
also need a way to run analytics of times spent on each task will change 
to 5 stars if that is possible"
__label__3 im giving it 3 stars it deserves 5 stars for the app but getting 3 cause after i bought some gems there were some shady withdrawals which means the privacy protection for my card was breached and im 99 sure its from habitica cause this happened right after the purchase please increase your cyber security for card transactions
__label__4 i love this app and i am so glad that i have found it i wish i had found it sooner then i wouldn't have wasted my money on other apps the only things i would like improved is preview of the tasks in the tags and my list view the box view for the tags to be colour coded instead of the text the whole box is in the chosen colour quicker synchronisation with windows keep up the great work
__label__3 can you make this app a separated planner and can make an event without using calendar i really like this app but i want this app as my daily task organizer and my calendar as a big event organizer so it won't jumble up in my calendar
__label__5 this is the app i never knew i needed i got the free version because it sparked my interest and upgraded to the full paid version within a day maybe i'm wired to see my day in the way they present it or maybe sectograph is wired to appeal to me i'm not sure either way their widget is the top half of my home screen and i am more in touch with my schedule than i ever have been
__label__5 very nice app it helps me be more productive
__label__5 i love this app very easy to use and it phelps me to keep track of my progress a
__label__3 its not easily understood and it does not notify if you are setting a task that the due date or due time is past i might want to set 16 00hrm task tomorrow at 18 00hrm today it will still set the task and will think i have set a task meanwhile the date is today
__label__2 incredible tool awful app i'd recommend the desktop version of this site to anyone but the app is a bug ridden mess that overcomplicates simple functions and only works about 90 of the time
__label__3 not user friendly free version very limited
__label__3 the app is great but things aren't automatic like there's no notification to make me use the app even though i turned it on in settings and the quote of the day is constant until i change to next even if days pass by it should be set to auto change other than these two fixes i love the app
__label__1 why was i charged 1 49 for this app i was charged 2 4 2020
__label__3 enquanto o sistema não oferecer no mínimo todas as opções oferecidas pelo wunderlist extensões não fará sentido ter os comprado a funcionalidade meu dia é boa mas não faz sentido façam com que tarefas que estejam agendadas para o dia sejam automaticamente adicionadas no meu dia
__label__4 links to my amazon alexa and very useful i hated typing stuff in but now i can just ask alexa to add stuff to my to do and shopping lists i really like it there was nothing wrong with it before i just don't like typing much
__label__1 despite working fine with the web version of the app this android version of ticktick throws a validation error on my email address when i try to sign in because according to carol a dev of the ticktick team with whom i spoke about this on their help forum my email address features hyphens tf since when are hyphens in address so uncommon that they're not worth supporting terrible imo ux both in app and for customer service
__label__5 that's a great app i have suggestion which would make this app perfect for me make option to delay all today's events for 1h or any other period of time great anyway
__label__3 add an event to calendar but it gets saved on a random day not current day annoying
__label__4 i used to really love this app too many ads for 5 stars now but i upstill like the way it works
__label__5 this app is as good as trello and almost works the same with some minor differences i love it it would be great if it combined the features of trello boards as well as evernote still givin deserves 5 stars on its own merits it can get overwhelming the more items that are put into it but that's my own problem of having so much to do more than the app this is the best automated to do list i have found i use it in combination with my handwritten lists
__label__5 keeps me on task
__label__3 i have not been using app for very long therefore the 3 star rating after some use i will return to rate again
__label__3 1 кривой и неработающий экспорт и импорт 2 нельзя удалить базовые навыки заданий и характеристики 3 нельзя удалять сразу несколько навыков заданий и характеристик 4 кнопка отчислить данные не удаляет всё а только откатывает к базовым спустя пару месяцев снова установил приложение загрузил с автосохронерия данных загрузилось всё базовое и с диска тоже самое настройки тоже проверял после установки изменяя данные и сохраняя их потом итог после загрузки зброс к базовым
__label__3 it is amazing app it was working great a week ago but i don't know why from this week it doesn't count the time properly for example if i studied 4hours it only shows 1hour but overall i really like to study when i use this app i hope they fix the bug soon
__label__2 has been one of the best reminder app available for a long time this most recent update messed up notifications on android 10 they don't follow the system dark mode at all instead you have to manually change it in the app or deal with mismatched colors it looks ridiculous seeing a white notification background amidst other black backgrounds in dark mode it also looks like the black is not a true black like other apps if this isn't fixed soon i'll be looking for a new reminder app
__label__1 looks polished app but time after time new issues come up raising these issues with the developer rarely gets timely response or interest in fixing it i'm a paid user today tasks lost their subtasks on one device while the 2nd device is ok for now to devs task and their subs used to sync across devices via google drive seems like you eliminated this feature by switching to google tasks in your recent update totally useless app now for me at least
__label__2 since i've updated the app it doesn't record my working hours and also it stops and freezes every time i check it should i uninstall it
__label__3 i am managing need a reminder
__label__3 i dont get any notification when the timer runs out please help
__label__4 you responded to but still don't understand my comment about repeating event scheduling i know that you can schedule repeating events i know how to do that but each repeating event is scheduled at intervals reliant on the original event date what if i sometimes would like the event to repeat from the actual completion date for example i forget to renew my library books for a week when i renew them finally l have 3 weeks before i need to review them again but your system says 2
__label__3 very useful app if you are in the habit of forgetting things but it has one major defect if you have set up a recurring reminder and if you miss one instance of that reminder further instances will never show up they are gone forever i had to pay a penalty fee for late payment into my credit card because of that ridiculous bug
__label__4 so far it is good but however i hate it when it still lags
__label__1 i set a reminder to do a task daily at a certain time however this app does not retain the same time on the daily reminders it will remind you and set the task to do but at an earlier time
__label__5 awesome
__label__5 this app is awesome at the moment while we're in quarantine i have to do a whole bunch of school work and it's just easier for me to make sure i'm doing everything make sure i'm getting everything done and it's just really great thank you so much
__label__2 the app is not working well it's not all recording the duration it stops responding every time i use it
__label__2 i am facing problems importing my lists from wunderlist
__label__4 i'm struggling to see the use of routines and programmes right now but the other features are really useful would love the option for a task's or to do list
__label__5 fun
__label__2 fun and helpful graphics are awesome just needs a few tweaks too easy to cheat i don't like the tavern because i am in recovery from drugs and alcohol so it's kinda anthemic maybe a temple option would be a better social forum for inclusion for those of us who don't drink and or use drugs it would also be nice if you could continue to see completed to do items after you have checked them so you can continue to visualize your progress
__label__3 it's fun a great concept but the app itself needs work it locks up constantly and has to be manually shut down and then re started and the reminders basically don't work at all honestly i think it would be best to remove the reminder feature for now until it can be fixed because not having a way to set one at all is better than using the feature and thinking you'll get a needed reminder when you won't because it doesn't actually work
__label__2 not in sync with my google account bad in regards to automatically getting what i planned and plus i can't use it when i am using my pc but thumbs up for this sectogragh the idea is brilliant please work on updates because very soon i might not use it if i still have to re enter all my days task and activities it should be able to get data from my google account and i should be able to use it on pc pc is really perfect use for this kind of app
__label__2 the app struggles to sort by due date i think it is at least in part due to the imported tasks from wunderlist
__label__3 the full screen ads are intrusive and seriously hinder the free version's usability before the ads this was a very solid and handy calendar app
__label__2 very productive
__label__5 uxch shush
__label__4 it's a great tool to start track and keep habits since i started using it i've been adding more habits i want to build and this app keeps me organized and reminds me of my habit goals i get to compete wirh myself and see where i have room for improvement
__label__3 great app but it takes away access to your data after a while unless you grant full access to email addresses google acct everything fair enough request but not by holding data to ransom either that or its been compromised by malware but i don't think so
__label__2 earlier it was great but now keeps crashing
__label__4 i have only had this app for a few days the more i search for solutions the more i find this is a great app but it needs a way to give each task a sortable priority number i love the my day page which gives me the most important subset of all my tasks i never put more than 5 things there if i complete them before the end of the day i add more one of my favorite features is the ability to hide completed tasks the biggest fault is i haven't found a tutorial for all the features
__label__2 it was a great app but after today's update i am finding few menu items in some other language even after setting the default language to english it is not helping team please help
__label__5 like the structure of the daily appointments so much easier to see my day at a glance edit unfortunately i had to delete b c would not update additional entries hence 5 to 2 stars edit 25dec i've noooo idea what changed to be fair probably system update or google calendar regardless sync works beauuufifully and absolutely delighted so much so i purchased pro feed the peeps that make good stuff thanx
__label__3 missing a few good features and isn't always the most stable of apps
__label__1 this app is completely unusable on my note10 the account creation is riddled with errors and when i finally get into the app i can't click on any items or add a new item without the app instantly crashing i was excited by the premise and motivated to start using it but the experience was downright embarrassing i'd love for a developer response here to acknowledge these problems and maybe offer some solutions
__label__4 good
__label__5 fantastic absolutely best of it's kind no ads great system of to dos dailies and habits that you want to have and break plus the tavern guild challenge quest party system really keeps you motivated as does the in art or out of world reward system absolutely fantastic
__label__1 in order to actually use the app as a planner you have to pay money very misleading and dissapointing
__label__2 has some cool features but now that i've used for a while can see has some real limitations and poor performance sometimes unfortunately
__label__3 i would like a button easy to access when i open the app in order to add a quick reminder i don't get the concept of 'my day' i find annoying that you can't set up the deadline and reminder i one go
__label__5 outstanding to do app
__label__4 i found todoist through lavendaire of youtube she is awesome i am grateful that to do list is really getting me back on track
__label__1 limiting sections is ridiculous so if you want to add things for 30 days you need to have seperate projects
__label__4 i think it's pretty cool how this app communicate with the calender smart watch greatly enhanced the experience as well good job i just wish there was a galaxy watch version of it
__label__2 this app is causing me a lot of trouble whenever i close the app and open it again the app says that forest isn't working so i have to delete and download it again and use it 10 times a day and also i have paid premium membership i have an android phone
__label__3 good
__label__1 just purchased monthly subscription until now my app is not working as a full version
__label__3 nice
__label__1 it's not working again what's wrong with this app nothing is fixed no bugs fixed
__label__4 awesome app just want one feature though namely setting up the feature of an advanced timer for a task if one wants then will make the rating 5 from the current 4
__label__4 it's good
__label__3 too many features are premium only
__label__2 the app keeps crashing after 1 use i had to reinstall so many times i like the app so please fix it
__label__1 rescheduling tasks is simply randomly not working rescheduling something for today can make task dissapear earlier i have experienced that it duplicated tasks this way a basic functionality is broken and i just lost what should i follow up today no activity log available as that is a paid feature i guess i will never try that now
__label__2 functions fine in general easy drag to subtasks can't adjust the notifications to not go through do not disturb mode bad if you work off shifts can't set timing of notifications in a productivity app scheduling is important reminders require premium seriously i'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay 3 month overall average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions
__label__4
__label__2 nothing special
__label__2 there ia no way to go back to the routine old interface new is ugly
__label__1 app has stopped opening
__label__3 it's alright
__label__4 very good app the only thing is that the minimum time is ten minutes and a lot of times i want to concentrate for five minutes otherwise really cute and it works correctly
__label__3 only events sync would have to uninstall
__label__5 best experience has helped me to be organised as much as possible thanks
__label__5 very good
__label__1 absolutely terrible i have a 30 something list of daily tasks to keep track of that are set to repeat it was very tedious time consuming to set up with in the first place but after several days at random points some items would not renew not all at once and no discernible pattern as to the tasks it stopped renewing they show that they are still supposed to repeat daily and they were last checked off several days ago and will not show up on the list for today 0 5 stars
__label__1 would be nice if you could import tasks from other applications but not only is that a problem but importing from a previous version of tasks is impossible too nevermind i'll just stick to what i got
__label__1 i wanted to delete one item pressed a millimetre too low the whole list is gone about a hundred items lost this alone makes the whole app unusable for me months later still this same fatal flaw seems like ms have no interest in improving this app sadly
__label__2 it is better if don't have buy pro version hoping an app free offline soon
__label__5 best planner out there i love the ability to take notes journal track projects schedule events and to dos all in one place excellent
__label__3 it's good marginally better than the one that is standard with the phone
__label__3 setting up late events past 11pm is literally impossible start and end times days will shift randomly when i make a change to the other whenever i do manage to get both right i get a same time error even though clearly the start and end times are different
__label__2 have been using this app for years and have loved it however a recent update that includes full screen ads alsolutely kills it i do appreciate that the developer has kept the app clean and free for the last few years but with full screen ads no sorry
__label__3 this is pretty great but has what i think is a major bug in the settings you can choose a default for reminders so i choose an hour before that means to me that if i say something is at 2pm it will remind me at 1pm however instead ticktick sets the task for 3pm and the reminder for 2pm this is obviously wrong fix that and its 5 stars but as it stands i now have to set each reminder individually which is a pain
__label__3 starting maybe in september i've started having issues i will add an event to the calendar which is synced to google but within a few days the event will get cancelled w out notice of course i can appreciate that the problem stems from google sync nonetheless the problem is serious as it has to do with the chore use of the application anyway i personally still use the app as the visualisation is still way better than google's so for me that still beats the major con
__label__3 very long time user latest updates are making things harder subtasks in recurring parent tasks are now automatically archived when completed and don't seem to reappear when parent task is due again example i have a weekly todo titled groceries with grocery items i need to buy as subtasks within that recurring parent task whereas before i could mark a subtask as complete and expect that same subtask to reappear next time when i go shopping again it's now completely gone
__label__3 absolutely love the app but the new checkboxes take up too much space please add an option to hide them
__label__4 love this app but i have two suggestions to make the habit function even better possible to implement please 1 interval tracking e g do a habit every third day resets to third day following every time the habit is marked as done 2 track a habit less frequently than once per week e g once every two months will subscribe if the app has these two abilities
__label__1 i have canceled for the subscription when at the first time i used anydo do i still have to pay i was try for free trial for the first i using this app
__label__4 almost confusing but i think it's ok
__label__2 this is not an rpg this is a goal tracker with an avatar ffs so useless
__label__5 greatly designed
__label__2 useful
__label__3 this app has a nice interface and a great idea but it seems to suffer the same issue i've found of all habit trackers i can't easily keep track of multiple daily iterations of a habit if i want to create a habit of say drinking 5 bottles of water a day i want to be able to check off and keep track of each bottle drunk then get rewarded when i finish all five most of the habits i want to develop fall in this category could this be implemented in the future
__label__5 good optimization and beautiful widgets
__label__1 i deleted still sending emails inscribed still cant get rid of it playstore help
__label__4 nothing like a to do list this is a power tool only one of its kind with this i can eventually time my teeth brushing and even toilet visits to the minute definitely not a to do list
__label__4 so quick and handy a proper list app with no annoying features
__label__3 good
__label__4 could use more fonts and options and a habit tracker but it's a great start
__label__4 this is a great app the ine thing that would make it better would be if it worked with google assistant google home amazon echo so i could make reminders in ticktick by voice
__label__5 super helpful
__label__1 i buy pro version but it features are not given to me
__label__4 amazing app
__label__5 this app is just perfect it helped me to manage my time so that i didn't waste any of my time i highly recommend it to others
__label__4 alarm not working at all i have checked all settings in my phone they all are on could you please assist me on same
__label__2 use to love this app as i've had it for well over a year just recently it magically deleted all my appointments with no way of getting them back tried everything from resetting to reinstalling no resolution i paid for the app so was a little disappointed that i have to look for another app and reenter all my appointments 20 a day
__label__3 app is overall amazing only thing that i was missing that there is not any feature for prioritising the activities hope the developers will add it soon
__label__3 i purchased the pro version but i changed my phone so the app says that i have to purchase to log in what should i do
__label__5 how to see my completed tasks i am confused as i accidentally clicked on done and tasks stopped appearing on the list obviously but it creates problem cuz you didn't do but it checked so please add feature so we can see all our completed tasks upto a month so we can see our records and edit any possible mistakes thank you other than this small part this app is best for me i am requesting you if you can listen us please please add this feature completed tasks list upto a month
"__label__3 has good potential you guys should allow the app to display the date when 
a task is due for example if i have to remember what day something is due 
 i e haircut appt wed 7 25 18"
__label__3 i need to track not only good habits but also bad with this app it is impossible i don't want to smoke at least two times in a month or greater to reach my goal i want to smoke no more then two times in a month or less for success
__label__1 a simple app that could not be more complicated to operate
__label__5 nice
__label__5 simply the most delightful app i worked with for my tasks it's minimal but it has a wide range of features specially how we can repeat a task anyway we want that's exactly what i was looking for
__label__4 the calendar reminders can be very shotty but the overall app is very useful
__label__1 notifications are not working after upgrading to android 10
__label__4 nice app super helpful to plan anything recommend it however it would be nice if you could at a to do list function that way i could tick off the things i need to complete for one time only such as homework good work tho
__label__2 syncing doesn't work that was the whole point of upgrading to the pro version i log most of my time in the firefox browser plugin and it never shows up in the app i also lost my account my account wasn't authenticating so i logged out when i tried to log back in it didn't recognize my email even using forgot password i ended up creating a new account with the same email i know i used before losing all of my coins you guys should look into any backend issues with syncing and accounts thanks
__label__3 originally had it at 5 stars but every time i study now my friends list is completely innacurate it won't show the correct amount of hours i've studied for on my friends list e g today i've done 70 minutes but it comes up as 20 very annoying
__label__5 brilliant app allows me to achieve my goals big ones as well as daily ones
__label__1 only reviewing so the app stops asking me to do so even when i do review the app still asks me 3 stars to 1
__label__3 this is a good app to motivate but wished there would be analytics to show progress like graphs etc
__label__3 best to do application still needed calendar view
__label__2 worked great at first but continously does not sync completely with alexa i only use this app as a shopping list with alexa but when it only shows 4 of 10 items on my list it's pretty useless the purpose of the list is so that i don't have to remember the 10 items i told alexa to add to the list which show up on todoist
__label__3 great app easy to use and convenient i love the vertical scrolling in the month view but it's a shame that it doesn't implement the functionality that allows to share my calendar events such that only a 'busy' status is shown and not the event details i use a nextcloud agenda and sync with davx5
__label__4 great
__label__2 just trying it out seems like a great app but has a really really basic miss that i saw referenced in another review theres no intuitive way to specify or change the time of a task tasks are all just all automatically set for 9 am and theres not visable button or option to change the time the other user mentioned trying to use google to figure out how but such a basic miss seems like a flag that maybe i should try a different app
__label__1 very bad
__label__4 only thing missing from this tool is an in app calendar
__label__2 what i love is that i can make multiple calendars with the same account what are some major problems 1 my events are not inviting or showing up on the calendars of the people who i include in the event sending a text message link doesn't work either 2 i have had events disappear from my calendar without explanation never had this issue with any other calendar and being a person with a very busy schedule and multiple schedules to adhere to this is detrimental p s i paid for premium
__label__1 force feeds users with video ads after each entry
__label__2 perfect app except for 12 hour sync with google calendar
__label__4 one thing the widget sometimes doesn't update the today list and about the to do list i have to make 2 different widget for today and tommorow because when all tasks show cannot differentiate what today and tommorow so i was check list my today and tommorow task and it is kinda confusing how to uncheck again maybe this option to check and uncheck must be there and the reward will be given after all the task has done for today thank you hope this app improve
__label__2 subpar so far the difficult to me is syncing lists between family members this app tends to produce multiple lists of the same theme
__label__2 i would love it if my calendar would sync across by devices and my tasks notes synced its disappointing because i enjoy the simplicity of the format its user friendly but iy doesn't work for me since i can't sync all devices
__label__5 its the best 'to do list' app i've ever come across by first impressions simple and easy to use looking forward to using it this week to get rid of my admin
__label__1 i have used this app for years i have always paid for the premium version at first it was my favorite app but it has gotten steadily worse now it is very glitchy it closes randomly and typically takes up to three minutes to open which is very embarrassing when i'm trying to set an appointment with a customer it also randomly unchecks completed tasks and reverts to older versions of my schedule the developers are uncaring and blame my phone note 8 i'm looking for a new app
__label__4 i'd like to see an option to mark parts of my routine as complete
__label__3 the app has been great on desktop and decent on the phone performance of the android app is noticeably worse than ios though especially on start up
__label__3 good app but had to uninstall kept adding reminders to all off my tasks and scheduled events even when repeatedly de selecting them very frustrating and inconvenient to get the notification and the email notification
__label__5 its great
__label__1 it was to difficult and takes a lot of time to create a routine
__label__3 it is good to organise the tasks the only problem is i am not able to get reminders i am setting the reminder but it is but showing
__label__5 this is exactly what i was looking for tried different task apps but il ike the layout and functionality and ease of use i can create multiple tasks with multiple subtask so i can separate home work and play kudos on a well designed app
__label__5 i find this an excellent to do app with sharing capabilities i love how there is even an option to have completed tasks crossed off or disappear altogether from a list i find myself turning up the volume to hear that sweet bell tune when a task is completed lol
__label__5 its very efficient and helpful
__label__2 i really love this but when i want to use it for second time this apps crashed i've uninstalled for many times but it still the same please do something
__label__5 this app is exactly what i was searching for tried many productivity apps but this the ideal app for that purpose it lets you plan your whole day as a schedule and lets you repeat the schedule as a custom routine lots of other tools and customizations best for procrastinators like me and for students who are preparing for exams
__label__3 most of the trees and species are not cute enough
__label__5 customise and tailored according to your needs best for every class of jobs as well as for students for making their routine go for it guys
__label__5 so happy with it helps me with my block scheduling
__label__3 nice app but would like access to a calendar without paying premium price
__label__5 the best app in the market for improving your daily habits i researched many habit apps in play store and finally concluded that this is the best one i changed my self a lot by regulary monitoring my habits through habitnow app the user interface is superb and quite simple also it provides habit statistics up to date you can also enter your habits according to the category like health nutrition etc a must have app for everybody
__label__2 syncing devices doesn't work even after reading and applying suggestions in the faq of the website
"__label__3 great app absolutely love it however i paid for the platinum premium 
yet i am still unable to get any of the premium features tried adding new 
goal habit and it still says i need to get premium to have more than 5 
please fix this as i have paid for the service and cannot access it"
__label__4 useful integrated
__label__5 super app great layout makes it better for planning than using a standard calendar recurring tasks function clears so much unnecessary mental clutter freeing up neurons to work on more passionate pursuits
__label__1 it doesnt offer anything that i cant do on my google calendar at least not in the free version i'm not going to pay for an app that is basically just going to import my google calendar when i can do the same things with google for free also i saw another review where they have deleted reviews which is shady if this gets deleted i'll look into the legal laws governing false advertising
__label__4 i like the usability and design a lot unfortunately it has to be synced with your normal calender which is a deal breaker for me i wanted to seperate work from my private life to keep a work life balance it's sadly not possible with this app
__label__3 useful app interface are easy to use would be better if you could add search function so we dont have to comb thru everything to find what we are looking for
__label__2 confusing over complicated and bland looking the fact that i had to go delete the habits that it had already chosen for me made it worse
__label__3 great idea but really needs to be able to incorporate reminders way easier to set up in my opinion especially for repeat events
__label__1 wunderlist was better shared my list with my husband and it won't sync or show up when one of us changes something it shows us both on the list but when he deleted an item it didn't show as deleted on mine after refreshing five times
__label__5 very good has power user features as well like defining properties through text and stuff haven't tried the collaboration part yet
__label__5 very good
__label__3 hard to use edit after your polite replay i edited my review from one star to 3 stars still find it hard to use good app don't require to read a manual to use it it should be user friendly and clear thanks any way
__label__5 sooow good
__label__5 love this concept love this app i've been following the development of habitica since it was still only online i love it plus there's plenty of active users to party up chat with and the devs are always helpful prompt my only gripes are that i wish i could change the colors of my tasks habits nitpicky i know lol maybe have a notepad area where i can keep habitica related notes like a key to the emojis etc i use for myself and maybe a proper separate friends list
__label__3 since the last update may 29 i have been losing random events tonight i've added the same event four times over the last three hours just waiting to see if it disappears again several updates ago the photos i attached to each profile stopped appearing i think the os was blamed it's been a great app for several years but i'm afraid of what else i might lose in the near future
__label__3 didn't really get a chance to test it but it forced me to do a review to uninstall
__label__2 get multiple entries of same appointment problem is with outlook and exchange 360 occurs with other calendars too
__label__2 have to pay for labels there's no separate sections for different categories on widget
__label__3 has trouble syncing google calendar not all events show up even after clicking sync now also tried hiding and un hiding calender but still doesn't sync
__label__4 i love this app it's easy to customise can you add a feature for a timer that way people can measure how long they did a certain task for
__label__4 i love that i can break a task into steps i didnt like that they moved the completed task button from the bottom of list to side menu all in all it is a good tool and it has improved a lot since i started using it
__label__2 it is a good idea but it's not really easy to use in fact it's quite complicated i bought premium because they advertised i could set schedules per day and i can but not how i had hoped i recommend to make it simpler by allowing the user to toggle days per schedule in the routine editor and additionally make any small changes in each individual day
__label__3 useful
__label__3 latest update is super buggy can't change if i want my dailys to be every 2 days 3 days etc because the keyboard jumps up and immediately disappears really annoying
__label__3 it's a great app but it has glitches i tried setting my work hours for tomorrow's date but when i clicked save and went back to the graph it had the hours set for today not tomorrow
__label__3 ребят конечно круто что вы сделали это в виде игры только вот вы бы могли доработать такие вещи сбивается сортировка задач после выхода из приложения я хочу чтобы у меня постоянно была сортировка по не выполненим ежедневным задачам я закрыла прогу на вкладке ежедневные задачи хочу чтобы при повторном открытии она была также на этой вкладке
__label__4 easy to add habits and tasks you see everything for that dat
__label__3 since the last update may 29 i have been losing random events tonight i've added the same event four times over the last three hours just waiting to see if it disappears again several updates ago the photos i attached to each profile stopped appearing i think the os was blamed it's been a great app for several years but i'm afraid of what else i might lose in the near future
__label__5 good concept would go for premium if price adjusted to be a bit more reasonable to give context other productivity apps created with a similar aim are around the 2 10 mark
__label__3 decent app but i was having issues with scheduling my week with it any time i tried to m f day schedule it repeated the same schedule perpetually even on the weekends regardless of setting day limits or time constraints will check back on this one might be my device thats the issue idk gui was clean and simple and you can set specific alarm sounds
__label__1 i see no difference in this and google calendar
__label__1 loved for a while one fine day my subtasks got deleted it was in a task for which i didn't set any due date bad experience
__label__1 notification not working
__label__3 when planting tree with exceeded timer count on the tree doesn't get planted even after the set time please fix this
__label__5 excellent balance between reminding you and not being annoying well done i have some ideas for you
__label__4 great app easy and simple to use the ability to save different schedules and just toggle each or all of them is perfect have some seasonal schedules that i can just turn on or off as required while keeping other routine schedules
__label__3 love this app keeps me organized and productive only thing i'm bummed about is i can override the locking feature even sent an email about it
__label__5 perfect wonderful idea
__label__5 i got it for the widget man it keeps me on task
__label__4 i've been using this app for about a year now i think i love keeping myself accountable and tracking what i'm doing and what i'm not each day lately i've been getting push notifications for every single message that members of my party are sending in chat none of which mention me i've switched off push notifications completely but they're still coming through all the time this is the only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars
__label__5 awesome apk
"__label__2 i really liked the app helped me a lot with managing my time efficiently 
to get the most out of my day but since i updated it it started acting up 
it use to be so easy to simply move routine blocks around and now it's 
setting it's own times or plainly refusing to be moved to a later time 
block which is infuriating and the app also slowed down considerably 
after the update"
__label__2 ads just too many
__label__3 disappointed had the app installed for a few weeks only i was enjoying it and improving my life and suddenly it stopped working i keep getting notifications saying that there's no connection i can't log anything and once i decided to reinstall again and again i can't even log in anymore the screen won't load and it never goes past the login register screen
__label__1 downloaded the app and the server just did not want to connect and synch my to do list and habits gave up after 10 mins
__label__3 download it because i love that it has a weekly monthly and daily goal views also lists and water intake goals but it doesn't have push notifications and it seems like i can't cross off events only goals or tasks and that's a huge deal at least for me so it would be great if you guys can make that happen
__label__4 it's an overall great app but the problem is that it notifies all of the notifications once be it at 8am or 10pm if there was an option where tasks are pinned on notification untill you check them from app i'd give it a 5 star
__label__2 this calendar would be a 5 star except for 1 major issue the sync is unreliable for example items placed on my calendar via google or gmail within the previous 24 48 hours usually do not appear no matter what sync settings i have or how many times i manually initiate a manual sync all other calendar apps i have tried do not have these sync issues
__label__3 where is the priority setting my app interface doesn't match the video you created for new users i liked everywhere and can't find any any to prioritize tasks only set a time for a reminder please provide up to date instruction for setting priorities and other details for using the app thanks
__label__5 life changer love being able to make nested subtasks and being able to assign dates to them web app and windows app work incredible well and feel native great google assistant integration but wish it was default for reminders which is probably something google needs to do to support it only complaint is wish task descriptions were free but pricing plans are quite reasonable
__label__1 yes i started with a 3 star review but i did drop it down to a 1 star review why the developed asked me to send a screenshot of a spontaneous mismatch between what i typed and what the app accepted as my task as per every busy developer he requested for me to email so that he quietly resolves the problem i will not do so he may take off my review but every user be warned you may retype your tasks with this app only for the program to clear it when exitting the edit menu
__label__4 love it bought premium but needs an option to schedule reoccurring tasks like take mom shopping first sunday of every month at 11am
__label__3 nice but without calendar integration it is still incomplete
__label__4 i like but there are some basic features that aren't free
__label__3 i kinda miss the old system where time specific trees styles were the thing now you can pick anything after focusing for 10 minutes it actually takes away incentive to study focus longer nitpick 1 the bracketed week has no space after the day example monday week instead of monday week nitpick 2 sharing it would be nice to share more than just an image of the forest perhaps some tree stats much like there is underneath the forest itself
__label__4
__label__5 i have been a wunderlist user for years when wunderlist announced they were transferribg to a new platform i started looking for options i chose tasks because of its high rating and it has lived up to its rating it is very easy to use unfortunately i could never get the wunderlist download to save on my phone so i have had to reenter everything by hand but it is doable
__label__4 please add 3rd party app integrations like alexa microsoft outlook calendar etc
__label__3 this app is fine in concept but the game part of habitica arguably the reason you would use this app over other habit tracking apps is just too boring and not that gamey to me which doesn't keep me motivated to keep going back to the app for my habits concept is good execution leaves much to be desired
__label__2 one of the most expensive apps i have ever seen or tried everything costs money subscription check paid themes check i mean i spent a fortune on apps and i am in favor of continuous support but still losing my lifetime savings is just not okay reminds me of the app newton mail where they went from free to oh my god this is expensive imo users would sub way more if the options were affordable sorry for 2 5 but if an app is inaccessible due to prices i can't say that it's an ok app
__label__5 nice app
__label__2 complicated
__label__5 it's perfect i've made excellent progress on my newly formed habits and i meet every task thanks to this app
__label__1 it's an okay app
__label__1 pagué por la versión premium y ahora igualmente veo ads en la app la app no cuenta con respaldos automáticos ni un login al menos decente lástima que una app tan buena la estén dejando perder ante el montón de apps de productividad que hay en la store
__label__3 love your hard work but it's there a widget with the calendar open
__label__3 good but doesnt make me go do habits bcz no pressure just notif
__label__5 this app is awesome i love it not only i'm creating healthy habits i am also learning thru challenges you get to talk to people and destroy bosses is really awesome plus i had some trouble connecting to the game and alys responded to me quickly and also they fixed it shout out to alys you guys are doing a good job
__label__1 me cobraron y siempre me pide suscripción ma de correo y nunca contestaron
__label__4 this is so helpful i use this with the forest app to stay on task you can add different calenders from google and keep work and personal separate
__label__1 doesnt work on all android wear os devices specifically doesnt work with the watch active2
__label__5 i feel good with this app it's a great note app
__label__4 overall an amazing app
__label__4 easy to use flexible i use the sub list feature to describe steps needed to accomplish a task i have lists for every day of the week some tasks need to be done each day e g wash dishes etc some tasks are unique and i create them as needed for each day i have 'to do' and 'done' sections once a task is completed it goes to the done section this app helps me focus on getting things done and has become an essential part of my daily routine
__label__2 this app is excellent and more productivity but don't have separate ringtone set option so i will easily get confused with sms or to do notification
__label__4 been using it for years and there have been tons of improvements great app just wish you could choose for notifications to come from top of screen instead of the bottom because many times a reminder pops up while i'm typing and i'll mistakenly dismiss it
__label__3 a little confusing at first but it transfers your calendar and alarms to the app one bad part is it adds everything on your calendar like if you add eat breakfast it'll go on your calendar so that's only a little annoying since my calendar needs to be clear and easy to read but besides that it works well
__label__3 it was working great for about 2 weeks but now shuts down ant time i try and invite atty attendee to any event so disappointed i thoight this was going to be my go to app and be reliable the search continues
__label__1 i like this app it's just that whenever i enter something in my calendar it would not sink right away
__label__2 this is ok for solo use but don't count on it to update between two devices my wife and i found out the hard way when i didn't get steaks at the store even manual refreshing doesn't help i googled the problem and it looks like ms todo has had similar problems for years on various platforms anyway i suggest finding another list app
__label__3 not as good as wunderlist simple things make it less usable than its predecessor such as 1 sharing internet page to a list and the list defaults to my day instead of one of your choice or the last one you opened makes adding lots of pages in a row slow 2 add new task from the widget puts it at the bottom of the list not the top 3 marking a task with a star doesn't move it to the top of the list other than that it looks smart and imported my old wunderlist lists on 2nd attempt
__label__2 a very good to do manager i would take a premium version if on the windows version it would possible to set change manage location reminders for this feature i already wait some years i'm really surprised that the programmers are not able to add this feature also at the windows app it's annoying so anoying that you have to edid every task in android again to add a location reminder but it seems to be to difficult for the programmers so when this is to difficult what can we expect will the maintanance of the windows app stay on a reliable basis waiting already since years for a change didn't know why the ask me to change settings on android to change place reminders on my windows ticktick may be i should give up 18 10 2019
__label__5 it's an amazing app cuz it's rll helped me in studying
__label__3 please add a calendar it would be great to have outlook calendar sync to it having to use outlook calendar microsoft to do is a bit of a pain all in one app would be perfect some people need to actually see their calendar so planned and tasks don't really work although it is a great idea
__label__1 new entries need to go to the top of a list with ir without a star still not an improvement over wunderlist
__label__3 notification does not sound pls develop why can not be set for 6 days in a routine week please like this
__label__2 the app is a little confusing in the way it works and it is a little ridiculous to pay 3 a month just to see a calendar
__label__3 i had several recurring events to keep track of my week but after the update they disappeared
__label__2 was interested in trying out the premium features until i saw that they're a subscription and a ridiculously priced one at that unfortunately the simple functionality of note taking which used to be handled very well by many apps seems to be harder to come by haven't found an app yet that will integrate with google assistant in any useful way
__label__2 quick add got fixed now the sync is broken
__label__3 the reminders are helpful and the app is easy to use especially when tracking more than one habit my only quibble is that when i changed phones it didn't port my records over like the instructions said they would but i did at least download the records ahead of time edit i returned to this app after a hiatus and not only had it deleted my data it also essentially deleted me i can't log in and when i try to register it says my email address is already taken
__label__4 great except for flagged email setting i get a lot of spam messages that are flagged therefore we should be able to select and or exclude certain folders
__label__4 lot more easy and practical maintaining calendar is fun loved the widget
__label__2 sync no longer works also app has been buggy lately closes down and does not respond i'm now using loop habit tracker which is more stable
__label__4 give a option for time range like sleep 7hrs but not from start to end cause we cant follow that much
"__label__3 i like that it is easy and convenience which is what i'm looking for but i 
also need a way to run analytics of times spent on each task will change 
to 5 stars if that is possible"
__label__3 i used to use habitica and i must say this is a great step up i'd like to see more social features such as sharing tasks only one person has to perform said task for it to be checked off but only giving that person the experience and gold otherwise the price for subscription is too steep thus resulting in a sub perfect score i could easily justify 0 99 month or eternal subscription for 15 if that price could be met as well as fine tuning this would be easily worth 5 stars
__label__3 still getting to grips with the app i'm sure it's great
__label__3 previous it working very fine but now there lots issue with the application eg if you had not complete yesterday task it wont allow you complete today tasks even reporting is not working
__label__3 bug message cannot be displayed on app android 9 nokia 6 1 plus
__label__3 the app no longer notifies me of my tasks please fix
__label__2 using this apps i can guarantee you will never remember one single task needs more improvements to be classified under reminders category
__label__3 love your hard work but it's there a widget with the calendar open
__label__3 hey the idea is very good but why don't you let me sync my phrases and i can't login in other phones it reminded me to buy
__label__3 works pretty good so far
__label__5 this app is great if you like structure in your life i love it give it a try folks
__label__2 works ok on galaxy note 8 but constant crash notifications can't even log on to the tablet version let alone sync accounts in the end all data lost and so am i
__label__3 can not invite my friend who's using 滴答清单 to join my list and idk how to give feedback in the app
__label__5 easy to use and easy to keep organized
__label__4 so far so good i love creating my own adventure still learning some of the functions maybe a tips video could help i can't wait to see what other fun things can be added more community or friends list or leader board then get us to do in app purchases for new items or level streaks i just like this a bunch so thank you
__label__1 i liked this app even paid for it but uninstalled it today due to weird behavior i see two other reviews here with a similar problem the app will periodically launch itself but it's just a black screen and it creates a copy of my home screen looks the same but frozen until i hit the close button then the copy scrolls away and i can again use my phone just odd
__label__4 it ia wonderful app
__label__5 this app is really good because i dont get distacted as much bc i dont want my plant to die so i stay off my phone it also helps as i want to unlock more plants so i stay on the apo longer work longer to earn more coins to get more plant would recomend if you find your self on tik tok or social media when you are suppose to be working doing school this is really helping out this quartine thanks
__label__2 good the only thing it has that isn't on my samsung cal is agenda view crappy my scal has dark mode buscal you can basically f off if you're vision impaired font size dark mode are paid only not fun to test drive in the bright white light uninstall
__label__4 this app is amazing to help me focus and study and do assignments i have brought the pro version but it wouldn't allow me to sync the trees i have planted on my laptop to my phone it would be amazing if they could fix it
__label__4 so far i am enjoying it
__label__4 my go to todo list app i'd love for the habits feature to be improved though
__label__2 notifications don't sync without opening the app
__label__5 i love the ability to combine calendars and task lists it is very customizable and easy to use i would love an option to have it on my computer as well and be able to sync them together there are many widgets and they are very customizable as well
__label__3 this app is very helpful total game changer for my adhd unfortunately after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped but overall i'm happy this app exists it really helps me stay on track perhaps if the game cost a few dollars to purchase the developers wouldn't need to resort to capping in order to create revenue from the app i feel as though many people will quit once the rpg element is restricted
__label__2 first thanks to the forestapp team for making this brilliant app second in iran we cannot pay for the pro version please find a solution to this problem
__label__1 the old version was good and interesting but in the latest version it needs money for unlocking each and everything
__label__2 price went up with latest update don't update until you buy all the trees you want example bear paw now 2000 coins
__label__5 i've been really enjoying this app the my day feature is really useful for managing my tasks and its so easy to just add new tasks as i get them i especially love that you can add tasks from the previous day to your current my day it has a simple and streamlined design and seamlessly integrates my phones theme the only thing i would improve would be the ability to add tasks to my day in advance
__label__1 markdown causes laggy typing in description and it seems i can't disable it
__label__5 absolutely essential to my law practice full featured yet extremely intuitive to use syncs perfectly with google calendar one of my earliest smartest app purchases as soon as i took the android plunge
__label__5 app is great can set timed reminders to keep going i like the visual encouragement that this provides for me with trying to stay on track
__label__3 pls add 24 hour view
__label__1 never responded to my original review in 2019 and the response to my latest review still doesn't answer the fact that any tasks that are recurring do not show in calendar even though you sync this information
__label__4 hey awesome app it wasn't long until i purchased the unlocked version however some things could be improved for example you can't change units after the habit is created and it would be nice to hide the 0 part after digits since mostly it refers to minutes or iterations or cups and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as learn at least 30 0 minutes or drink at least 2 0 cups if the number is whole why not just hide that point zero it'll look neater i think
__label__3 i like the app on how it organize your tasks you can customize how you will be reminded and prioritized unfortunately the alarm doesn't work it either late or not working at all i thought if i pay premium it will fix but it didn't so 3 5
__label__2 to do list apps like this one are not useful without the capability of using recurring tasks too bad because the interface is otherwise well done
__label__3 great potential but i can't use the app to its full extent due to its counter intuitive layout just filling two days in routine view turned it into an endless scroll shame the app really looked like what i was looking for reply thanks for taking my review into account yes i think a horisontal orientation would be much better maybe leave both options that way everyone can decide what best suits them
__label__2 the app is not working well since the latest update 2 37 0 the app crashes a lot when creating or editing tasks the reminder for tasks and meeting are not working notifications are enabled so that makes the app useless reinstalling the app doesn't solve anything
__label__5 very nice app specially you can add sub tasks
__label__3 its nice enough app but synchronizing between the tablet and phone should be alot easier and more reliable than what it is
__label__5 recommended this by two work friends to help keep focused as we read long sometimes boring documents works so great i feel really motivated to keep reading and stay off my phone even for things the app doesn't track like not chatting to co workers i feel more guilty conscious of concentrating when the app is running and growing my tree so i have cut down on chat with coworkers and stuff too
__label__3 really
__label__4 i like the way it separates lists sub lists horizontally and i can switch between them conveniently with swipes though i tend to accidentally delete tasks when trying to switch lists i value the convenience of swipe to delete the most being able to quick add tasks from the main screen removes one extra tap step being able to highlight important tasks but wish it would automatically pin them to the top feature i wish most for image attachments idea location based reminders
__label__1 i can't upgrade to pro version anytime i hit the unlock button the app will say some error happened 6 please try again later
__label__3 works great but when i start creating events and switch to a different app and go back to business calendar they disappear also very limited unsearchable collection of emojis no statistics on events too would also love to see goal tracking needs prioritizements of tasks also no option to find a time for an event
__label__1 do not pay for the app sync doesn't work they dont support the app but they are always ready to take your money
__label__3 awesome features but poor ui i wish the app isn't so cluttered with low res motivational posters and others' habits in the community really dont need know that someone out there is trying not to watch porn for 89 days why 89 who you tryna impress
__label__5 i really find this very useful and easy to use very user friendly only problem is there is no way to delete all completed tasks it has to be done one by one any chance of fixing that
__label__3 no funcionan bien las notificaciones y tengo la version de pago
__label__5 smooth and easy
__label__3 quick but need moree practice to add sub lines to proper list
__label__4 very easy to use
__label__2 the app slider for the font from normal to large is not working it is only giving two options normal and large the slider doesn't slide across and let you set your own font size
__label__2 synced well with wunderlist to import lists but despite having reminders activated i get no notifications to remind me of upcoming tasks or events which makes this pretty redundant as a wunderlist replacement
__label__4 it helped me a lot to stay ahead of my schedule a productive app but after some time some reminders don't work and i have to set them again
__label__4 i paid for premium on this and it is by far the best todo app i've used the only thing keeping it from getting a 5 stars for me is that it needs an option to set what time your day ends or when the day starts because i usually end my day at 2am and by that time tasks become overdue and karma points are not credited for the previous day nonetheless great app
"__label__3 great idea but would be better if it was stand alone and not dependent on 
google calendar to input times events"
__label__4 great app easily share lists with others easy to add or check off items one enhancement request would be to make another default view option the list of all projects rather than having to choose one project to default view
__label__3 was looking for something which syncs with google tasks
__label__5 brilliant app helps me to keep track of everything i'm doing
__label__5 it's helped me stay on track with habits i want to cultivate i'm really data driven and thrive on external validation so i like seeing graphs and the calendar fill up with my successful days it works well for me the app itself is good too it hasn't crashed or done anything unexpected in the week i've used ii find logging mt the only thing i wish i could do is go back and change what makes a day successful
__label__2 it sorely needs and undo backup restore revert feature in case we accidentally touch swipe a circle bullet which then gets unintentionally deleted immediately which i find incredibly frustrating it also needs a flexible feature to import export other common text data formats like csv xml events to from calendar not just copy reminders to tasks if google fixes all that then i'd give it 5 stars
__label__5 i have tried soo many to do apps but this is the best i've come across regret that i found it this late this is an amazing app great work guys planning to buy a subscription pretty soon one suggestion instead of billing annually could you do it quarterly or monthly subscription
__label__1 this app will not update nor uninstall properly fix it and i'll try it again
__label__1 it says you are downloading the pro version which is a complete lie
__label__3 i liked it but the due date you can't change only the due time also getting the feature up for the due time is hard enough so going to try a different app
__label__1 who wants to pay 3 a month the free version just tries to upsell you the premium version while you're trying to use it
__label__1 terrible wunderlist worked well nothing seems to work now transitioning was not easy i had to set up an account i don't want and don't need i am not happy microsoft has not done well with making things user friendly for some time now i wouldn't be surprised if they don't start stealing everyone's information and using it without consent like apple does oh wait i can't tell the difference between any of these companies now and i am pretty sure they all do that and don't care gfy
__label__3 this application was exactly what i needed when i first started to use it now there are a handful or problems events are appearing twice events get deleted or not appearing at all after being saved deleting one event and the reoccurring events get deleted and not appearing on the selected reoccurring days very annoying
__label__3 it would be nice if there was a warning what certain buttons do i was trying to figure out how to change the day from day one clicked clear day and it erased my entire schedule it should say clear routine if that's what it does i'm a little pissed as i just paid for the app so i can make a schedule still unsure of how to do what i need
__label__4 it's user friendly and can be personalised very efficiently but i am currently having issues with it overlapping with the built in google calendar it didn't use to i keep that for personal use and this one for business obviously but now they both sync and show the same things whichever calendar i select so i cannot use them differently i hope there is a way around this otherwise i will have to download a replacement
__label__1 it didn't let me watch the video to double the coins and it said i reached the limit of watching an ad for doubling the coins even though i couldn't watch any ads and didn't get my doubled coins at the end
__label__3 beautiful app l love the functionality and look however it won't sync with my android phone l use it on my samsung galaxy 10 1 unfortunately this shortcoming really affects me since l now have to enter everything twice once on my tablet then again on my phone
__label__4 pretty good overall
__label__3 had a great experience when i was using it thru browser but when i installed it on my phone it wouldnt record all my progress and tasks on my phone application even with the same account please work it out i would love to keep using thru my phone
__label__4 i like the ease of creating different to do lists ability to create subtasks and that i can make my grocery shopping list according to what store i shop at it's great that the grocery list are automatically sorted by aisle for you however i noticed that if i add a price to the beginning or end of the grocery item that it gets put in the 'other' aisle category i also like how you can switch something in one list to a different one just by tapping on it nice work
__label__4 it's working really good so far i've been looking for something like this for so long thank you
__label__5 this is absolutely what i was looking for it generates my job events thanks
__label__2 stopped working after a week
__label__4 very useful app helps you stay focused
__label__4 i use free version and its useful for everyday tasks 4 stars because there are too many ads
__label__1 i loved this app for years but for the last 3 months ever since i got a samsung note 10 plus it duplicates every entry puts some events on the day before or after and shows every event as a birthday
__label__2 complicated
__label__2 i can not figure out how to get it on my galaxy watch ugh
__label__3 i love the idea of it but currently it's far too complicated for me to use i'd love it very much if all the setting rewards and gained skills was a little easier to do
__label__3 i really like this app however it doesn't force keep the trees growing in the foreground anymore unless you give the app access to almost everything on your phone you basically have to give it root access and even then it's not guaranteed to work the security risk isn't worth it to me
__label__3 i schedule a 9 a m meeting in pennsylvania while i'm in california but when i get to pennsylvania my 9am meeting is now off by 3 hours i would like the times to be fixed no matter where i am
__label__3 beautiful app l love the functionality and look however it won't sync with my android phone l use it on my samsung galaxy 10 1 unfortunately this shortcoming really affects me since l now have to enter everything twice once on my tablet then again on my phone
"__label__3 i liked its features these are well thought through if i could go back in 
timeline it would have been better"
__label__3 why won't my homescreen widget display all day events this makes it really difficult to use
__label__3 its a great app in general just want a couple of tweaks that would make using it more streamlined the biggest thing is i have goals that increase incrementally every day i would love to have a way to have a yes or no that shows that incremental adjustment also when inputting numerically set goals i want to be able to just start typing the number and have it replace the default 0 0 without placing the cursor and backspacing to enter a result still the interface is otherwise great
__label__3 a nice slick design but ticked off tasks are displayed on the list of tasks i have to do new tasks are also added to the bottom of the task list this is annoying and i would like there to be a setting to adjust this
__label__4 not exactly what i needed
__label__1 doesnt work the main screen is stuck i can move to the next page
__label__5 app is one of the coolest app but some functions i didn't understand properly what's their functionality
__label__2 does not show reminders
__label__4 very simple easy to use reminder list system not a lot of fluff complications a lot of other programs like this do but just switched from a 5 to a 4 star as security program showed all of my device info is being sent to facebook servers in ca please tell me developer is not selling my info to facebook developer has not refuted this for quite a while now
__label__3 it would have been better if it kept its own database rather than relying on the calendar i don't want to put trivial things to plan my day in my calendar uninstalling
__label__3 it is ok but maby it could be a bit more clear
__label__4 pros really good app in terms of productivity and usability love how it's possible to colour code and label tasks eg personal work university etc love that it syncs with my google calendar plus i love the app's ui i also like the focus option cons i think the focus option should be more like the forest app and not allow you to go away from the screen tree otherwise the tree dies i also think you should be able to add attachments to events like you can with tasks
__label__3 good app
__label__3 it's good but has some points to improve
__label__1 i just cannot be notified please fix it so i could give 5 stars
__label__3 i like it it's very reorganizing
__label__3 recurring tasks an essential feature is available only in premium premium is not available for one time purchase monthly payment is way too much for an indian it got to be affordable with one time payment for everyone to use may be some one time payment option for different features like recurrent tasks location reminder and paid themes would have been made it accessible for many
__label__1 very nice app could be very useful but unfortunately does not sync
__label__5 has every feature i could ask for in an app like this and it's all executed perfectly leagues better than any of the other options i do feel like 30 a year is steep for premium though for new users know that premium is by no means necessary it just gives you a little more capacity for random operations and unlocks some convenient functionality
__label__1 this trash barely works all functionality is hidden behind obscure icons all your time is spent guessing where any one function might be you can't control how to manage repeating events and things magically disappear when you least expect that
__label__3 zapier integration doesn't work for me it says something went wrong at our end
__label__2 i dont like how it charged me automatically after the free trial without informing me expiry of trial or if i wanted to subscribe to the paid service
__label__1 major issues need all email so i can send you pics pixel 2xl
__label__3 the day pro widget view shows events overlapping despite them not scheduled at the same time it's an annoyance but an overall decent app
__label__1 not user friendly directly asking for money i already uninstalled
__label__4 i used to really love this app too many ads for 5 stars now but i upstill like the way it works
__label__1 first the app changed my task name then the task just disappeared and was not in the app bad app
__label__4 easy to use to schedule repeat event alarms easy to create different routines and turn them on or off this feature was helpful for me only item missing is a time tracker for client jobs or training specific tasks even manual tracker would be good
__label__2 there are better options available i just didn't like the layout and functionality of the app i tried it for a couple of months but now it's deleted and i am going to try another
__label__4 widget not working correctly when updating the date of task to future date it still shows in today task
__label__2 it doesn't work for me in few days i plant trees but the time doesn't work please help me i don't want to uninstall the app
__label__5 great app loved the design style feels great to use elegant and quick way to construct your day
__label__1 just basic app without any exciting features why i pay for this useless app please don't download it's a cheat waste of time and energy
__label__3 i love this app but who in the world thought this new scheduler was a good idea it takes forever to set up a time now please please please bring back the clock round scheduler back
__label__1 doesn't work offline requires internet and information so not personal as it is over the internet sorry did not get past first screen requiring sign up uninstalled
__label__5 i started using any do when i was very unorganized and had too much stuff in my head i used the 7 day trial and got everything out on paper with all of the different kinds of things i had to do and it was all included in any do which was perfect so i signed up for a year everything from doctors to paying bills and making a grocery list i've never had a problem it's wonderful
__label__2 the most recent update just made it harder to move times around
__label__2 i had made an account for this app a long time ago but didn't use it for long and i forgot why until i re downloaded it today this is one of those apps that's incredibly frustrating because a lot of the main advertised features are behind a pay wall and or you have to make an additional account for paying more than 1 mo for a list app is ridiculous if anything it should be a one time purchase
__label__3 much prefer the look layout of wunderlist lots of little things in to do that aren't as good as wunderlist and it's a huge shame that it is being retired for this as a minimum everyone should have the option of making it look exactly the same so we don't notice the difference as it is the text is too big extra items that can't be turned off such as 'my day' clutter the screen and it just doesn't look feel as good shame
__label__3 nice but the price is soo high for this
__label__5 i love how simple this app is i've tried full gtd systems which are too complicated for me by keeping things simple this app forces you to prioritize i don't need hundreds of tasks organized in a hierarchy just a simple app to keep my goals in sight this app does it with a beautiful easy to read interface tip you have to be creative with the sorting order to make it work for you for example i sort my today list by 1 priority 2 habits first 3 time it works beautifully for me
__label__3 i love the overall concept and the diverse options for setup though so many setting options are a little overwhelming to sort out i've had the app for a few weeks and i am still trying tweak my layout visuals are everything for me i believe when originally setting up a few weeks ago i was a bit annoyed to have spent time choosing colors for the widget to find out it is a premium feature to developer plz be upfront on the premium feature options i think once i get it really working for me it will be a fave app
__label__5 i love it but after the update widget stopped working for some reason but wait for it you fixed it in the next
__label__4 i am quite liking this app i could stay more focused than before but o flaw that i met in this app is that u cannot pause the time people may have to do something else or something important but then they have to give up and go to that work which results in whithering of one plant maybe you could provide a pause button but also take a note that if anyone hits press and opens any other app it should automatically stop please keep that in mind
__label__3 hi we migrated our lists from wunderlist we use shared list but now even we shared the lists that were previously shared they do not sync so other people don't see the completed items if they assign a task they can't see it completed there are duplicate lists with the same name one is shared the other one is not when creating new shared lists the people who received the invitation are unable to join they see an error list unavailable i tried support but unavailable
__label__1 app doesn't work
__label__4 transfer was seamless from wunderlist last appt to to do
__label__1 a simple app that could not be more complicated to operate
__label__5 great it's a great game to motivate people to do big stuff who just keep sitting on the sofa and don't want to move thank you creaters of habitica
__label__3 simple and easy to use
__label__4 wunderlist being killed by microsoft seems like most people are coming to this app instead of moving to the recommended microsoft to do giving this a try
__label__2 so it's good i payed for pro but the issue i'm having is adding my routine to my timeline because whenever i try and add it it takes me to edit my routine it's really annoying because i'd like my routine in one clean place if this is fixed i'd definitely rate it 4 stars
__label__4 helpfull apps but it would be great if there is search feature
__label__5 best app using it for 2 years now and its perfect for me
__label__4 just what i was looking for it's simple which is all it needs to be
__label__1 it was the best app i've ever used until the last update i can't plant the tree even though i click plant it starts at first but then stops counting time i'm so sad
__label__3 how do you get it to sync with your ms outlook calender what does it mean you detailed it in 8
__label__2 this an amazing calender my only problem was i was looking for a calendar for solely for my business because this app you must sync your calendar it becomes useless because now you have your personal calendar mix with business useless for that purpose i can just use my google calendar
__label__1 this app keep on crashing in my device fedup of this app
__label__1 wow completely annoying trying to get you to buy premium on ever page so much for trying it out
__label__1 too hard to use
__label__4 if only the calender icons cld stop piling up on the phobe task bar everytime one is due so if i created 5 events to go off in an hr i'll have 5 icons piled up on my fone it's not needed or at least put an option so people cld disable it if they don't want it
__label__1 that is very bad app
__label__2 do you love apps that design their experience to be poor unless you pay ongoing subscriptions for static feature sets that make the experience barely tolerable do you prefer having money siphoned from your account over and over again instead of paying a single small fee once for an app like we used to see then this is the app for you add one more debit to your bank account they hope you'll forget about and statistically speaking you will for a stagnant app you'll forget about in a week
__label__1 the app doesn't notify me when the task is ready to do please fix it or tell me what to do only when runs the app tasks work
__label__4 pros this app is very similar to the functionality of wunderlist and adds features i wanted free version is fully functional except for the limitation of 9 lists cons some of the widget buttons are small and i am not a fan of subscription services for premium features i would pay a one time fee even for each upgrade but i absolutely won't subscribe
__label__5 thankyou exactly what i needed a wish to developers please add option to make local task list appearing 1st by default when creating new event and not the calendar
__label__4 i've just installed this app and so far it seems like exactly what i had been looking for kudos i just have one suggestion the app exits on pressing the back button once most apps exit on pressing the back button twice which works great for the user experience in my opinion so it would be really great if you could incorporate that hoping to use this app every day
__label__5 love it
__label__2 replacing wunderlist that i've used for years syncing lists not working reliably so it's useless for me switching to todoist instead
__label__2 clunky and very slow to load not fun at all just yet another task i had to deal with daily
__label__3 i dont get the point of the game
__label__5 2019 10 15 edit just wanted to update my previous reviews to say that the problem i initially encountered seems to have gone away i don't know exactly when or how maybe thanks to an automatic update of the app itself or android but timetune notifications now happen reliably and on time just as you would expect so i'm now upgrading my initial 4 stars to 5 stars big thanks to the devs 2018 11 05 edit already in touch with support and testing after restarting my device it appears to be working but i will need to test for a few days before i can confirm initial review app itself is great but android keeps closing it after a few minutes of inactivity as a result notifications don't happen i've followed the troubleshooting steps which i was already familiar with and have worked for other apps just not for timetune i wish i could fix this it's such a great app
__label__4 its a good app the cool thing for me is that you can comment per day so if you fail with your habits you can find out what things stand in your way i withdraw one star because i want to make a feature request when you select all habits i also want to see all comments mixed this way the app would also be a holistic diary thx
__label__3 enjoying the app
__label__1 ads interrupt you while adding items to your calendar this app used to have a banner for ads at the bottom which was fine now the ads are annoying and timed reply to developer no thanks i rather uninstall your app completely
__label__1 failed at the first hurdle couldnt customise my character to even get started next button worked thats about it galaxy s8
__label__1 app is completely broken can't even make an avatar none of the options show up also get an error message when trying to show a display name
__label__5 simple app easy to use
__label__2 how to use this app very bad experience please simplify the process nobody wants to take a extra tutorials to use your app to plan our day
__label__3 why don't you remove the task after it's completed we have recurring weekly tasks and when we check it off you have to manually remove the task from the list am i supposed to have like 80 completed tasks like a psychopath i like things uncluttered i might be able to let it go if i didn't get a notification every time my husband removes an item because he's equally neurotic i can't change notification settings for that either i want to be notified of task completion not removal
__label__5 i was a todoist premium user loved todoist but the calendar view and list folders converted me over to ticktick premium i prefer ticktick's ui widget and task entry as well if you like todoist you'll like ticktick but ticktick has some extra polish in places that i appreciate
__label__3 frustrating update plans
__label__3 doesn't do anything until you take the premium membership
__label__3 been using for couple of years with no issues till the recent update with ad pushing well can't really complain coz we're using it for free but it's too distracting when you're checking your appt during crunchtime unstalling as a result reverting back to plain old no fuss google calendar tks though
__label__3 it has very nice useful and comfortable look i used it with a pleasure unfortunately synchronization with gmail calendar stopped working tried to reinstall this app it helped for a week and stopped working again
__label__4 the app works great as a digital day planner the only complaint that i have i dont see a way to edit tasks after i enter them
__label__4 good app for daily planning
__label__5 i've tried other calendars and i just love the layout if only the widget layout can be changed when first opened but it shows everything i need very easily i can share my calendar with other people i can change the colors another recommendation is to gain more colors for the appointments overall super happy will not be choosing another calendar
__label__4 great app good at keeping you accountable and productive would be nice to be able to re order your to dos though and set deadlines for when they have to be done
__label__5 love it
__label__2 boxes are too wide on the widget it was better on wunderlust as i could see a lot more at once
__label__5 i love the interface and the colors it's very smooth and fun to look at
__label__3 the alarm ringtone cannot be changed and thats not good the people that use apps lile these often work in a noisy environmnt and a full volume continous ringtone a small beep does'nt work for them hope you consider
__label__1 ads interrupt you while adding items to your calendar this app used to have a banner for ads at the bottom which was fine now the ads are annoying and timed reply to developer no thanks i rather uninstall your app completely
__label__3 can you make this app a separated planner and can make an event without using calendar i really like this app but i want this app as my daily task organizer and my calendar as a big event organizer so it won't jumble up in my calendar
__label__4 great app and easy to use would be great if there was a no date option on notes for like shopping lists ect that aren't just for the day
__label__3 please make the widget minimalistic customizable half transoerent like in com stuff todo what you have now it too cluncky all branded and in most cases doesn't fit homescreen aesthetically also make it possible to use different colors for sub and subsub tasks for example white grayer gray shifting from the left is not enough
__label__3 even though you don't get full access for free this app still helps you a lot with habits you want to change it's just an organizing tool to motivate you to keep going worth a try
__label__3 dear support it is a pity that microsoft is closing wunderlist because that app is very simple to use and very fast unfortunately your to do app is slower there is not done job with hashtags tasks need to be selected before moving in wunderlist everything is much simpler and faster guys please take good features from there it is big pain to lose wunderlist at least upgrade your app normally thank you
__label__2 can't sync i paid to have the ability to make more tasks but that's about all it's good for
__label__4 great app for the most part functionality is amazing sync is great but i really hate that this app puts itself on top of whatever i'm doing every 5 minutes exactly been through all the settings and turned all syncing off but no incredibly obnoxious on my tablet haven't had the same issue on my android phone
__label__4 i wish there were a few basic color options in the free version but this is good enough that i'll buy the full version when i catch up on other bills lol
__label__5 super helpful and has definitely increased my productivity as a student would have loved to have discovered it years ago great job devs
__label__5 very good app to plan your day i really like it
__label__3 why doesn't adjusting habit streak reflect in health and experience say if i accidentally clicked or for a habit
__label__3 this app is amazing but after one day when i try to open it it will just go back to my phone home screen when i uninstall it then install it again it will work but i will lose my forest and after a day it won't work again please fix this issue i really love this app besides that issue i'm facing
__label__5 excellent very visual tool
"__label__3 although much improved the app could still use some work it doesn't do 
landscape and still needs ui improvements when working with pets and items"
__label__2 the app is constantly loading and you can't even record your habits and reminders don't work also having just 5 habits free is bad too
__label__5 this app is working really well for me definitely helping me stay on track with habits i'm working to build and stop
__label__5 best todo app for me simple to use
__label__5 this app reminds me everytime i forget about something important and it's all organized i this app thank u so much for making this app
__label__5 this is a great calendar app and it also connect to your other calendar apps like your google microsoft samsung and so on keeping you in touch with every calendar that you have on your phone
__label__3 there's a bug where i can't add tasks from the widget tasks only get added if i actually open the app pixel 3a also items get added to the bottom of the list by default what the hell microsoft
__label__4 amazing app but the extremely buggy ui have made the app irritating to use and sometime unusable without a restart
__label__5 i absolutely love this app first of all it actually works and give me all the motivation i need to get stuff done secondly the community is awesome and there is just so much stuff to do recommended to everyone looking to develop habits
__label__3 this app could be five stars to me what is stopping me is the confusion on knowing just what tasks to do or not to do there's a confusing list of tasks that show up at the bottom and if i did not do them the day before or not click them they just show up there if i delete a task from the calendar on accident what do i do the calendar should be completely removed cuz it's worthless i think tasks should have some sort of streak function or show how many times you have done it in a row
__label__2 tried it out the time function which is 90 of the app imho is clunky the default end time is until next activity but then it automatically changes to the start time of the next activity and you can't change it back then if you add a task that overlaps other start times it deletes the other activities i spent 15 minutes setting up a schedule and was frustrated to find that i had erased my entire afternoon schedule because i made a mistake when changing the end time of something mid day this app was for me ironically a waste of time
__label__5 because it lists everything in alphabetical order it is now the perfect app thank you microsoft
__label__3 i'm giving it only 3 stars because there's no support for caldav tasks sync
__label__3 hi i enjoyed the app but now it's crashing each time i try to open it and i have to reinstall it i wouldn't mind of it was the first time but this is like the fourth time it's happening mind looking into it
__label__2 the not completed tasks do not carry over to the next day automatically i wanted an app that would constantly flash incomplete tasks in my home screen otherwise presentation of the app is good
"__label__3 i like the idea and will probably keep using it but it keeps telling me i'm 
not connected to the internet even though i am i don't know whether it's 
working fine and throwing errors or if i might be missing features due to 
these errors nonetheless worth downloading"
__label__3 setting things up can be a bit confusing but overall it's good the notifications aren't working on my phone and when setting the task to something that can be completed all day i'd like to be able to set times for me to get notifications about it without having to do the weird give me a notification 12 hours before the whole point of me getting a to do list app was to have not only a list but reminders so until the notifications work i'll have to resort to a different app
__label__1 bekar app at all
__label__3 it's usefull but would be much nicer if there was an option to play a notification tone just once instead of repeating it continuously
__label__1 no hourly reminder
__label__4 i was using wunderlist but this seems to be a great replacement it integrates very well with outlook 365 and the reminders are easy to manage would certainly recommend it for anyone looking to manage task lists
__label__5 good app
__label__2 i've set a reminder for me to drink water it doesn't remind at all
__label__3 was really looking for an app that lets me have multiple repeats for a task within the same day everyday duplicating a task multiple times and then making those into subtasks seems to be the only way but it clutters up the task list like 8 lines so i'm reminded to drink 8 glasses of water and then subtasks show up twice in the daily list both within and outside of the main task i thought the repeat every 1 day 8 times custom setting might work but it's a different function
__label__3 wish it would link to my calendar so i can create edit and complete in one location that would make it 5 stars
__label__2 i would rate this app 5 stars except i hate the way it scrambles all your tasks every time you change time zones it's absolutely maddening if you have a lot of tasks because you'll be forced to re priotitize every time going coast to coast with a layover and you'll be doing it three times ugh update constantly crashing on my galaxy note 9 now like 20 times a day
__label__3 why doesn't it turns off my message notification
__label__3 a tease i converted from wunderlist to todo only when i read that i could send my family members lists when the link is clicked on it states that the list is not available now and it's not you it's us then i read that members have to be on the same account i like the new todo but i have tasks and lists assigned to others but no way to communicate that
__label__3 back button doesnt work
"__label__3 uhmm i love the idea of this and enjoy using it at the same time it will 
be amazing if the app could offer to change the date format for ex 
actually it is month day year for me it's too weird i'll prefer something 
like year month day or day month year"
__label__2 i don't understand why it's not letting me type in it it gets hanged everytime i meant that amake ora onek birokto kortese sorry i speak only bahamian
__label__2 i tried the free version i liked the way that you are writing the day to remind you and it set itself but the free version doesn't support calendar and for me this is a big minus i prefer to use google task app that signs up with calendar and reminds you for the task
__label__4 very useful app gives reminders easy to set up
__label__3 yas
__label__1 my go to for years until the last update ads used to be unintrusive now you have to wait 10 seconds after every calendar update for the ad to run uninstalling now
__label__5 just starting out will post an honest opinion after i take it for a spin
__label__3 has the potential to be an excellent all in one calendar and to do list however i cancelled my subscription two weeks in as 1 subtasks automatically repeat when repeating main task is completed regardless of time and due date settings this should be optional 2 subtask reminders should be optional 3 calendar functions are very limited e g ability to set up an event rather than a task would be a valuable addition
__label__4 just don't give 5 stars when not using most function but those functions i use totally satisfy my needs
__label__3 useful app interface are easy to use would be better if you could add search function so we dont have to comb thru everything to find what we are looking for
__label__5 i'll try this one
__label__1 add the feature to quit bad habits and to track progress of tasks
__label__1 app has too many error to count
__label__5 elegant design this app is easy to use and only takes seconds unlike other apps that distract you with details blog posts etc i'm looking at you myfitnesspal i can easily track my habits in seconds without going down the internet rabbit hole edited to add that i'm still using it weeks later very simple although i started off ambitious and added many habits i ended up following the developers suggestion and paring back to two key habits i'll add more after these stick
__label__1 i couldn't register the circle rounds and rounds and nothing happens
__label__1 tasks don't update their descriptions until you quit and re open can't set more than 7 tasks without paying an absurdly expensive weekly subscription
__label__3 the best looking todo app i could find very complete would be the one i use but unfortunately sync with google calendar takes hours up to a day the issue seems to be a couple of years old you can check it in the customer section on their website and nothing was done to address it while the competition syncs in seconds if you don't need google sync then it's great i'm now using another app sad
__label__1 why do i need to pay for basic features such as showing your tasks in month view it's a calendar app those are stuff you need to see can't believe you need to pay premium for a calendar todo app to show your freaking todos in the calendar
__label__2 i have a lg k30 phone and after an update the app no longer kills trees when i try and open another app this happens if the whitelist is on or off and if advance detecion is on or off if this gets fix then this app deserves the 4 6 overall rating that is has
__label__1 always freezing
__label__2 i really enjoy this app but it has just stopped working randomly i tried to hatch a dragon egg and the app crashed and since then i cant access it i have tried uninstalling the app but nothing is working i have even tried to use the website but it doesnt keep track of my exp gained i am very dissapointed as i really like the idea of the app
__label__1 downloaded ticktick thought it seemed cool so signed in with google account and tried to sign up for monthly subscription kept getting error messages and it wouldn't let me start the process or even add a card waste of time
__label__3 app friezes when changing plant offline fix needed
__label__3 very nice
__label__4 the app is good and all the only problem is that the reminder does not work
__label__5 great app for focusing
__label__5 engaging and effective it doesn't seem to be possible to use a google play balance to pay for gems though
__label__1 wont synch to calendar have to buy pro version
__label__2 i already had bought the full version and now i have to pay again which is whatever but furthermore my calendar is missing most of the appointments and recurring events that i had before i just upgraded my phone to the htc10 from the lg g5 and i have none of my important calendar events now
__label__2 good idea bad execution the first screen with the customkze character options wouldn't let me pick anything therefore i couldn't move on
__label__3 kept on crashing have been installing and uninstalling a few times and still kept crashing
__label__3 i prefer the browser version over the app version it's hard to find all the options in the app version the app and browser also don't sync well and one time i lost all of my health and money upon opening my app version for the first time in a long while even though i had used the browser version earlier
__label__4 awesome
__label__5 i love it one thing i had a problem with earlier was that if i didn't have internet connection it wasn't possible to log my dailies in now i have unlimited data so this isn't a problem for me anymore but might be worth solving this for other players everything else is just wonderful and a big help to life organization for scattered mind people like myself
__label__1 complicated and tasks vanishing i dislike this
__label__5 wow i really love this app such a great idea i first downloaded it for my youngest daughter to try help her with responsibility organization we connect daily on the app to check each other's progress i generally enjoy this game it is the only one have on my phone
__label__4 solid perhaps overpriced
__label__5 i rarely rate but this app is awesome simple habit tracker with backup option and realy neat habit display
__label__4 finally an organised app for notes and daily planning with a modern ui it works great only downside is that payments are monthly i'd rather pay it immediately though in my opinion the app offers sufficient features in the free version
__label__4 nice app it helps a lot to save time you will understand where you used more time and where you should spend more time
__label__3 good
__label__2 loved this app for years the new full screen ads with no skip option is ridiculous and will likely drive me away i understand the need for ads but this is too far and i have no need for any of the pro features so i will not pay for it when i can use a different app for free that doesn't block my productivity i used to recommend this app to anyone who asked but now i won't
__label__4 overall very good but cant make a task with splitscreen
__label__3 needs internet connection and is a pain to set up simole tasks
__label__3 add seamless integration for office 365 accounts
__label__1 at the features are premium
__label__1 cant even get past the first screen i get a notice that my phone is blocking the app but there are no instructions in the troubleshooting for my pixel i've looked all over my settings there's nothing i can find to change to allow this app to do something frankly i'm dubious that this app somehow needs some extreme level of permissions that no other ever has especially as it hasnt told me why
__label__1 can't even add my list straight to the calendar wants me to rewrite everything which is annoying asf stupid app
__label__3 it's really cute and motivating but what i'm missing would be an option to set a tree to be planted at a specific time
__label__4 it's a good app but can be better i want the developer to fix the following please 1 when you work with it sometimes it becomes laggy and you need to force stop and restart the app 2 when you type in it in persian the symbols like etc doesn't align correctly 3 if you add some native calendars like persian calendar to it it will become more useful and also an option to set it as main calendar not like google alternative calendars that show gregorian months not persian months ex
__label__3 recently the app has shown a bug in repeat appointments i always have repeated 3 day appointment for friday saturday and sunday it starts in the evening of friday and ends next sat morning saturday evening to next sunday morning and sunday evening to next monday morning after monday the appointment repeats every 5 weeks it used to work correctly until mid 2018 now the sunday evening to next monday morning appointment appears in the week before the correct week please fix it thanks
__label__2 your condescending attitude is not helping yor case there is a sublist reorder but nothing for the main list there is no sort of any kind says sort by do date or lets you pick what to sort by a logic choice completed tasks need to change imiediately so you know it's completed next month is set i didn't say it wasn't simple the interface is not very intuitive i did look at help there is little for the main list you are very irritating so i am going to try other choices
__label__2 the widget is feezing after every night
__label__5 excellent update thanks todoist team i would suggest customizing the font size on the widget as it seems small
__label__5 very helpful so i can remember what to do on that day
__label__5 vy useful to hv
__label__3 ok works like wunderlist which was wonder ful except it doesn't integrate with google calendar wth
__label__1 i hate it i loved wunnderlist it was just perfect why did you guys have to change what was great this new app is so unclear things don't stand out the way they did i imported all my info from wunderlist and it is all messed up i will be looking for another app and give up on you asap
__label__3 hmm i just don't like it
__label__3 i used to love it but now every time i want to add any tasks it asks for speak text which when you're trying to discretely add a reminder is offputting fix that and you've got a great app
__label__1 tree keeps failing for no reason please fix
__label__3 i would be happy to give the app a five star rating as i have reaped many benefits i directly relate to my usage of habitica but i am prevented from doing so by recent events i can only give you a three star rating because suddenly your application no longer functions with no warning or information as to why or how to fix it 500 characters is not enough to relay proper data on this issue to the dev team likely by design and for that i blame google play not the dev team of habitica
__label__2 while i can understand limiting somethings for premium only i've never seen an app block widgets behind a pay wall and quite frankly this is only useful to me if i can keep track of things on the homescreen maybe i would have liked it but so far i havent used it because i keep forgetting its there
__label__5 i love this app it's the best and keeping things healthy with yourself and i love it so much
__label__5 the best ever convenient and easy to track
__label__5 it is a very easy to use app it has helped me greatly however you could improve by not removing timers
__label__4 very nice app and easy to use
__label__4 this app is great but maybe let us tick task we completed from widget as it's annoying the app will opened up when i pressed the box to tick what i've completed everytime
__label__2 this app is not good if you don't buy the subscription
__label__1 it's trying to charge me money and i dont even have it installed
__label__2 great app to keep focused but too many glitches as you can tell from other reviews for me it has crashed in the passed currently the problem is that the vibration alarm doesn't come on when i'm done my timer so it's literally failing at it's secondary job to keep time of your session 1st job is to keep your phone away from you during your study session because of the glitch i have missed a bus a couple times b c the timer didn't ring i am displeased also the new updates seem unoriginal
__label__5 love this
__label__4 i really love how i can see my task list and calendar side by side the only reason why im not giving it a 5 is because i would really love a desktop version to use when im on my laptop
__label__3 the app would be nice and work well if it wasnt for this 1 issue but its a pretty big issue as far as daily planners go it only shows half of a clock or calender in the create event task subscreen meaning i can not select any times that would fall on the right hand side of the clock or i can not select a due by date for tasks because the right side of the calender is missing i would already own the full version if it wasnt for this problem
__label__1 i have been using this app for many years definitely one of the best calendar apps for android unfortunately too big desire for monetization of the app won full screen ads which you cannot close are now popping up after adding events and more such a big disappointment you can of course purchase the app but for me it doesn't add any more value as i don't use pro functions i guess it's time to switch to google's native app
__label__2 awesome app but soo many bugs
__label__3 in middle
__label__5 fun easy to do notifications are perfect it's just totally amazing
__label__3 overall i like the app however i'm uninstalling because of the pop up notification that goes over other apps and basically freezes my phone until i dismiss it the app doesn't have permission to draw over other apps and no way to disable this notification the only reason it isn't 1 star is because overall the app is good they just ruin it with that 'feature'
__label__2 i have problem with purchasing the pro version when i click on buy pro button it says already purchased please restart the app i have not yet purchased it though and nothing happens when i restart the app
__label__3 it never reminds even thought i've set the reminder
__label__4 great app i suggest having more reminder options
__label__3 purchased thr app as a replacement of the simple calendar widget but it has no advantages over it
__label__5 wonderful app must have took a lot of effort to make it
__label__4 i've been using todoist premium for just over one year now i think i've tried nearly every todo app out there there has been some quirky behavior introduced over the last few months especially around rescheduled occurrences of recurring tasks and it's been a bit frustrating there but overall it's the best app for me and the team behind it seem like great people based on my interactions give it a shot
__label__3 tbh i like this app when i installed for first time but now this app always force close
__label__5 i love this app simple easy to use easy to organize or reorginaze and shuffle my tasks around as needed this is the best task app that i've ever tried and i've tried quite a few high five to the developer now i want it for desktop and across all of my devices i hope that option is coming soon
__label__4 just installed and trying out i'll update along with my experiences ui ux is pleasant and clear looks promising love the free full featured premium accessory features philosophy i'll pay later on to support development issues 1 can't change start date repetition of a habit if it'll break history data at least allow duplication 2 would expect scheduled days to be colored marked in the single habit calendar as future overview not just as achievement overview so far good job
__label__3 needs option to sort by due date and time should be able to set some tasks items to move into next day automatically should have custom sort or dedicated grocery store shopping list option so you can sort items by how they're arranged in the store please add these options this would be the best to do app ever
"__label__2 not what i was looking for i saw there was a time it would remind me i 
thought it would work but non of them did so that sucked"
__label__3 those dots on the right of each item are gone how do you reorder your to do items now
__label__4 overall a good app to manage your tasks a good planner with nice ui and charts
__label__4 awesome app i like the daily work and habit tracking thanks guys
__label__5 a fantastic way of sharing tasks with the family and alexa
__label__5 the task list is so easy to use and it synchs my phone to my laptop
__label__4 excellent calendar worth the upgrade
__label__3 the app no longer notifies me of my tasks please fix
__label__4 all it needs is google calendar integration edit oh wait it does have it i was using the any do chrome extension the little pop out thing when writing this review the any do chrome extension does not have the ability to display google calendar events alongside one's any do tasks whereas the any do android app does indeed have it afaik it doesn't have ifttt applets but i'd return if it made some
__label__1 not easy to use always begging to buy pro version
__label__3 pretty good app
__label__3 nice visualization of personal activities
__label__5 does exactly what it should tips don't overuse it if you're new to this put in one or two habits worth tracking and make them count make sure they're connected to your bigger goal or purpose and aim big you're here to great work go for it
__label__4 would be good to have a tomorrow list so when in bed clearing mind at the end of the day the default list my day isn't cleared
__label__3 tasks cannot be ordered by their time a habit not done is not shown as overdue edit i checked again to use it but 1 recurring task cannot be created 2 habits are shown like scheduled tasks it's motivating to see habit progress instead on landing screen 3 it's more useful to see progress on habit activity instead of successful day if we set to do 2 times a day but we could do it only once it should show progress for a 30 day goal as 1 2 today 1 60 total instead of 0 30 or 1 30
__label__1 i thought upgrading and paying the 8 fee would allow me to use all of the functions of this app it does not i haven't been able to sync any of my devices absolutely will not let me add an event this was a waste of time and money if i can't add my schedule on my lap top version then there's no point to this app plus there's no support or anyone to contact to help trouble shoot or credit me back
__label__3 cannot duplicate a list
__label__3 it seems very nice the inferface can just get pretty overwhelming to look can
__label__4 i love this app it's perfect for making a variety of different lists and tasks and to dos i like how simple and straight forward it is and how you can easily colour coordinate or specify each task with labels and reminders the only reason why its not a 5 star is because it would be very great to have a grocery shopping specific list you could create that had the option to order foods in different food groups or store categories ie dairy veggies meats etc thank you
__label__3 it serves its purpose i have not used too many others to compare i wish i could set different reminder sounds i hate the ads after adding an appointment sometimes i have 2 things to add and have to wait which is not ok when coordinating with a doctor's office
__label__5 this is the perfect calendar app and its gorgeous to boot
__label__3 the setup seemed nice but the constant pop ups are so annoying as to make it unusable
__label__5 wow i tried many apps like this and in my experience this app is the best one so easy to use after other apps with too many options and not understandable design this app is perfect you just click ' ' and enter the name that's all of course if you want you can add time and date and something else i recommend
__label__3 i wish reminders weren't just a premium feature they should be a basic feature everything else is fine
__label__3 love the interface and how easy and helpful it would be but the alarms i set do not not ring i gave permissions to this app already yet it doesn't edit thank you for letting me know it's a huawei power saving issue are there any work arounds the power saving mode on huawei to still allow this app to run the alarms are very important without them the app is critically impaired on my device haha thanks
__label__5 exactly what i was looking for a way to set up and visualize my weekly routine
__label__1 i agree with a previous user that recent updates are making the app worse i've used this app for several years and loved that my to do list syncs across devices but recent changes specifically deleting completed tasks instead of leaving them visible able to be restored despite modifying settings make this app basically useless for my purposes i'm disappointed that i need to find a new app after so long using this one
__label__3 great app because i can keep all of my tasks synchronized to my laptop great for a student but on mobile i can't create new tasks with a custom due date because the keyboard doesn't go away in the calender to chose and i can't select any other dates than those in the first week can't even reach the save select button simple fixable error but it infuriates me every time it comes up
__label__1 definitely i appropriate your hard work and this app different from all those big guys apps but question is if someone lost the phone or uninstalled the app what is the purpose this app so i'm just suggesting you can limit the how many task can be added by users without premium opt in ads for auto backup
__label__3 i want dark mode without payin like the light mode is too light
__label__2 still no search for android tags can't sorted if i use this program for even a month i'll have a jumbled mess that will take forever to find things unusable two stars for calendar integration and manual sort
__label__3 there is an issue in this app where comments dont show up on mobile app but you can see it on desktop or web i have to logout from the app for the comments to appear this happens every now and then when it happens i just need to logout and login but i find that inconvenient pls fix
__label__5 a more in depth kind of to do list plus you get to monitor where the kind of activities you do would lead you in the long run good job
__label__3 the widget freezes a lot the calendar is not intuitive to use
__label__2 non functional with google account was great but can't use right now
__label__3 for some reason i can't exit the app which i press the back button on lenovo yoga smart tab only home or app switch buttons please fix
__label__4 unable to tap widget to open app and open calender since update thank you for response sorted
__label__4 good app but not exactly what i was looking for this app uses your calendar events and organizes them in the circle the controls are great i love when i move the red time bar it scrolls through all the things and shows the time changing love the widget i wanted this to work out a homeschool schedule i ended up having to make a new calendar and syncing only that one i was able to change the colors of each event in the app very easy to use overall
__label__4 by far this is the best to do list app i have used but i have 2 issues with new widget first i can't press the icon and go to the app like i used to the icon is gone now and second the font is too small really hard to read my list
__label__1 installed it and it glitched and didn't display many of the images on the 'create your avatar' page immediately uninstalled
__label__3 it was great for 1 day i cant open it a waste of time i need to uninstall and download it again for it to work for just 1 freaking day dont download
__label__1 this was a great app but it hasn't been updated since 2018 and sadly it be can become unusable in an instant with no fixes in sight i cannot recommend this app i would try something similar maybe open sources or with dev support
__label__5 very exciting app very helpful for my daily or weekly shedule
__label__4 it is the perfect app for me when it comes to tasks habits however it would've been nice to if you can add sound when i mark a task complete
__label__1 does not import from wunderlist very disappointed with having to switch we've been using wunderlist for some time and it's been great and without issues now we're forced to switch over and when i follow the instructions keep getting the 'nothing to import message' this is very frustrating developers please fix asap
__label__2 there are full size ads that block your entire screen incredibly disruptive and i don't want to reward that by buying pro there are other calendar apps out there that don't deliberately disrupt your productivity
__label__3 good
__label__5 its ok but we can not undestad repeated task shedule
__label__3 it is a good app but idk the widget keep freezing not changing hour in my device till i clicked the widget but it when i get out it freeze again plz fix it asap
__label__2 fundamental problem in their development cycle force users to update but the value to the consumer doesn't have a feedback mechanism prior to forcing the update is there not a beta program with participating users todoist that's what you need to fix for everyone else my widgets have lost their usefulness and are now just place holders until i can remove the complete buttons shrink text have fully customizable widgets or settle on another app but really focus on the root problem
__label__4 the app is allready great the amount of customisation is surreal and with a bit of tweaking you can really make it work the sentimental value you create this way really helped me grow as the app is rpg themed those elements could be further enhanced imo i think a customisable character would be fun more options to spend the currency other then personalised awards is what im getting at this way you really build something with the effort you've put in for the games keep up the good work
__label__3 alarms are singular and not like an alarm clock
__label__1 this is my first time giving a review on any app i've downloaded this app is a huge downgrade from the now defunct wunderlist the fact that you need to use a microsoft account is annoying but to add insult to injury you can't even share the lists normally with people outside your organisation what ever that means so now all i have is a glorified sticky note i mean had i'm erasing this app the second i finish this review
__label__3 it's fine to use to check off stuff and gain lose habits and get rewarded for it but the formatting is so ugly and it's so easy to cheat which kinda defeats the purpose of the app like you can make yourself level 100 or give yourself 2 000 gold if you want to plus there's a lot of bugs even though habitica has been alive since either 2015 or 2014 so that kinda says it all for how much the staff is on things
__label__1 enough with the pop up ads i don't mind if an app has ads but if i'm going to be interrupted by a 15 second video every 5 seconds while i'm checking off my list i'm deleting your app and no i'm not going to subscribe just because you keep popping up the subscription page if i have to pay to make the app decently usable you may as well require i pay for it to begin with
__label__3 please make the reminder work it's really important for me to remember things because i forget and don't do it in the end
__label__5 nice app and good for my focus skills and it also helps me to build my focus skills i am very happy about that because i love this it will allow you to stay focused on your work instead of checking your phone after every interval of time i appreciate the people downloading the app you should download this app surely
__label__4 great and helpful app love it
__label__3 so i did not get it does this app only import events from calendar can't i create my own daily routine within this app that would be way cooler to be honest as i barely use calendar
__label__3 sometimes the notification doesn't ring
__label__4 good alternative to todoist with some extra features that were a must for me ex dedicated calendar
__label__4 i love this app and i definitely recommend just sad that the timer wont be available in the app anymore it was very useful
__label__2 no custom repeat frequency
__label__4 your app is awesome please add sticky notification
__label__5 my to do list is now perfect my work has been so clear and my thoughts are well orgonized the best app i have ever worked with bravo bravo to all the team of habitnow
__label__5 it was really awesome this is what i was looking for i can track all my habits and task and also can see the history i am notified in time having a good time with this app the theme is also nice really loved it
__label__3 love the idea but the app is so buggy and not too user friendly at points first off i can't change my character when creating an account because nothing pops up it's just missing so i end up with a female characters i have galaxys10 and tried reinstalling app but nope seems to be just a bug also changing outfits just seems terrible to scroll through the not user friendly part the good idea is amazing i really want this app to improve so i can incorporate this into my daily life
__label__4 needs more vibrant colors perfect everywhere else
__label__4 love it just wish i could have pixel icons for all tasks and rewards either uploading my own or if you could design things like pixelated toothbrushes cute icons and a fun as well as organized visual aspect will help me to be in the app more and getting it set up as it has been a slow project i'm working on
__label__1 i can't activate notification for complete focus time
__label__2 not so easy perhaps pro version may b good uninstall
__label__3 really nice great new take on daily calendar but causes constant appcrashes
__label__3 no need for floating button on widget i think add button on widget needs to be smaller also possible to make the widget until 2x2
__label__1 couldn't even set up one single recurring reminder without being required to pay monthly subscription get your greedy hand off it dev it's only only a reminder app not a useful service
__label__5 i normally don't review apps but this one is amazing this digital planner was exactly what i wanted give it a try you won't regret it
__label__1 using the app since years now whenever open the app trying to save an entry full page advertisement opens for atleast 30 seconds causes missing what more to enter on different dates this app is at its worst
__label__3 great but basic in design and you cant not preview things such as sound its basic to use but some features are a little annoying like all the tags in one place id like the option to categorise
__label__3 missing some key features having the ability to have the same task in multiple lists and an 'undo' button to undo completions deletions done by mistake
__label__3 appears to work the same as wunderlist and imports your lists but if several people share a list you can't share it anymore
__label__3 good so far only used a few times may review later on
__label__5 thanks to all the creators of this app you have made my life sorted love from india
__label__3 i love this app but i wish free users could do more without a membership like at least they could be able to see the leaderboard
__label__3 this app can be a little intrusive probably i was looking for a light weight one and this one is for people who is after a all round task manager
__label__3 it's such a bummer it doesn't work on the samsung sport watch
__label__1 used it for a fair amount of time without any problems suddenly then asked me to create an account or log using google or fb i used my google one only to discover everything was gone
__label__2 lots of in app purchases not worth the time
__label__4 the app was working fine until i removed google now now the widgets will not show on home page
__label__5 the game aspect really does motivate me especially helpful for doing the dishes there's a big difference between i should do xyz and i have to do this or i'll lose health points and i don't want my party to get attacked
__label__5 i love making lists and this application makes it much more accessible to do so i don't have to worry about which pocket my hand written list was last put into i don't have to worry about keeping a pen on me or losing it in the store for the tenth time lol and i dont have to check things off the app just checks it off for me with a single tap
__label__2 the app won't open anymore and before that i couldn't log into my account pls sort out one suggestion i would like to make is the option to arrange the trees and bushes the way we want it's a good app just struggling to get it to work
__label__4 useful
__label__5 love this app i use this to consolidate multiple work and personal calendars in one view i love the ability to manage appearance and notifications for each independently super helpful in maintain work life boundaries
__label__1 i agree with other reviewers here the new notification redesign from v5 3 0 on android 10 is a bad idea and results in a confusing and unhelpful user experience the new notifications violate google's material design standards which google have provided to app developers for a good reason to provide a consistent user experience across all apps the new notifications look strange and behave badly compared to standard android notifications please kindly revert back to the official android notification standards that you used prior to v5 3 0 i've also sent you an email providing more details about this
__label__4 very helpful for busy scheduled hard workers
__label__3 it technically does most of things you would want a list app to do but it seems to make them a bit tougher than other apps or charges
__label__1 ever since the recent updates the app clash and wont work as the plant button were pressed unless the wifi mobile data were on it works fine i would give 0 zero star if i could running an app in internet connection can be interrupting especially for students please fix this issue as i'm wishing to depend on the app with no internet connection as how it used to in last version
__label__2 the sad thing is that it didn't allow to sync data it requires pro version to be purchased
__label__4 great app ideal for planning ur day nice premium subscription
__label__1 used to be good but started showing full screen ads even when the app is not open currently unusable
__label__5 i couldn't open the app after i installed it reinstalled game tried again and still doesn't work edit thank you for fixing the problem i re downloaded the app and it works perfectly it's very fun to pass time with this app and i'm also really happy that you can listen to music on this app too while watching the tree s grow
__label__2 i've had this app for a few years and it worked well until the last several months it's gotten increasingly buggy and will do things like forget you checked off tasks as completed and re list them as incomplete between closing and re opening the app it also had been freezing more and more frequently to the point where that happens at least once a day and now i can't even load certain screens because of this i will not be renewing my subscription this year and will be using another app
__label__3 i love the app but you cannot add file to your task or schedule this lack of ability to add file on such good app make it incomplete i could have rated it 5
__label__1 pathetic i was totally in love with this app until i changed my phone i lost the phone and when i installed the app in my new phone everything was gone my habits data for last one year every damn thing and i have purchased premium of the highest cost there's no way to restore my data or contact the devs if you cannot save on json file of mine in your cloud please explain why i should buy premium there is a sync option in the app don't tell me i should have manually synced my stuff
__label__1 couldn't figure out how to set reminder times won't do anything other then am
__label__3 latest update is super buggy can't change if i want my dailys to be every 2 days 3 days etc because the keyboard jumps up and immediately disappears really annoying
__label__3 i don't get reminded everyday like i wish shalom
__label__4 i really like this app so far its flexible ans very customizable the only thing i would add is either more categories the ability to add my own health and home are very broad categories so being able to have sub categories would be nice
__label__3 i have enough credit but i can't purchase for premium
__label__4 love it would like to see a few more details in the graphs it would be handy if you could scroll through the weeks smoothly instead of one week at a time the dark version of the app should be the standard imo it looks cooler ánd it saves power i'd love to have a timer as an option to measure the amount of time spent on a habit thinking of meditation breathing exercises
__label__2 good shared tasks but app itself makes me angry it keeps forgetting i am logged in with my google account so i need to login for like each two weeks or so and it also forgets my settings edit unfortunately this has not been fixed yet even though i had sent logs and communicated with you decreasing my rating
__label__4 i love this app so much it helps me stay focused and on task while i'm in class and at home studying i recommend this for any student struggling to put down the phone and focus on school the reward system is amazing and i can wait to unlock more plants as i progress as a nature lover i live for the idea of helping out the real life environment aswell which is an amazing feature of this app the only down side is that it sometimes crashes which is frustrating but i can get past that
__label__5 i've started using todoist again recently and fell in love with this app it's one of the best list managers and the big advantage for me is that it is cross platform
__label__3 neat concept just not for me
__label__4 this really helps me to stay organized with my appointments birthdays and other important dates
__label__1 i set a reminder to do a task daily at a certain time however this app does not retain the same time on the daily reminders it will remind you and set the task to do but at an earlier time
__label__3 pretty good took a while to figure out how to set up a task too many steps screens to set reminder time recurrence etc i feel those should all be on a single screen after saving i can't edit all i get is a prompt screen to sign in or sign up great feature for some but i don't need it it would be nice if that feature was said to be mandatory in the play store listing i wouldn't have wasted my time 3 stars for the forced share and the many stepped interface seems to be feature rich
__label__3 great and powerful app except for one thing location doesn't work when entering addresses whenever i type an address with house numbers the location recommendation list never contains the house number
__label__1 november updates broke a lot of functionalities please fix guys choosing alert notification sounds ability to close off tasks on notification bar lost full purchase info
__label__3 i need help the tree does not die if i leave the app maybe because i have a razer phone 2
__label__1 the new version is too complicated to use and i could not find any directions however a application with a easier use will be my preference
__label__1 sync does not work i've tried multiple times to get it to work and my internet connection is just fine had to switch phones when my old phone died and can't get my old data back on the app because sync doesn't work also no way to import data great app if the feature worked or could import data but rendered useless because of this so if i switch phones or have to reset to factory standards i lose everything paid quite a bit for this app just for this feature alone but it does not work
__label__1 1 why are you disabling enter key's next line function when i click enter key next line does not come so i used other apps to type with new lines by using enter key 2 now when i cut and paste the exact contents from another app even then it does not appear line by line it appears as a paragraph
__label__3 suddenly stopped giving audio reminders tried everything including re installing and turning on all notifications uninstalled
__label__5 i think it's great however sometimes i would like a better tutorial like how can i personalize the sound of one item in my routine
__label__2 setting am pm is not easy
__label__2 had to switch from wunderlist to do lacks functions which make wunderlist so great importing worked well but sharing previously shared lists required me to make a new 'personal' account this wasn't an issue before all is set up now and the app feels limited still in themes and settings most of all why switch why not just rename wunderlist to say 'microsoft wunderlist'
__label__2 it used to be a good app until they added the latest update which includes ridiculously annoying ads and frequent crashes
__label__2 free version allows only up to 5 habits to be added but app description doesn't mention it had to spend an hour setting up habits then uninstall the app and find a new one
__label__3 seems like a good idea but the widget is invisible it is there i can see the edges when i try to move it but it's completely invisible i tried decreasing the widget transparency and deleting cache but to no avail devs any clues thank you
__label__2 i used to love this but now i need to pay an insane amount or have both the pro and free versions both on my phone if you already have purchased the old business calendar pro you just have to keep it installed on your device to activate all the pro features of business calendar 2 unfortunately we have no possibility to automatically check if you are a pro user of bc 1 we can only check if the old bc pro app currently is installed on your device
__label__3 could you please add the option to repeat the tasks
__label__5 this just helps structure your life so better
__label__5 it does what it says on the tin encourages good habits and tracks your success and yes it is addictive succeeding
__label__4 very nice app for maintaining our schedule need to improve sechudule reminder not working properly
__label__1 downloaded the app uninstalled within the 5 days they offer you for free now i noticed they charged me a full year subscription of 900 inr what a sneaky way to generate revenue
__label__5 very good for time management and reminding you when need to get things done
__label__3 used to be very good recently i'm experiencing disappearing of events and random switching of visible calendars
__label__5 great good tracking with work and lifestyle
__label__5 very helpful simple and effective app design support from others and discussion helps a lot to form a habit as well as get rid of bad ones password lock ensures safety the developers have definitely put lots of work into this app free version and premium works great i ordered premium and it's worth the money
__label__3 i was under the impression that you could connect the app to your google assistant and add things to your shopping list vocally but i can't seem to figure it out how to sync google assistant to any do can anyone help me please
__label__2 not very user friendly
__label__3 its a to do list that can go everywhere with you and no writing can prioritize list as well great little app 11 2019 edit hoping like other folks that they undo the changes this app has gotten more difficult and counterintuitive with the last update used to be able to select multiple items to reschedule at one time can't do that anymore also used to be able to just type repeat everyday repeat every monday wednesday and friday etc it now seems like only sometimes that works
__label__1 very expensive for a simple app and quite useless without buying the premium only tracks 5 habits lame i can't believe this is the app advertised in the play store and still has a high rating because it is garbage sounds like even if i bought premium it would be worthless for transferring data to a new phone as the app claims i won't even risk it
__label__5 after microsoft announced the end of wunderlist i started using this app because of its similar ui and organizational capabilities been using it ever since with my girlfriend works for everything i need it to work for
__label__1 you can't even try it out they are automatically asking you to pick a subscriber plan before you can even see a calendar or anything
__label__3 not able to open events into another calender app it always opens events in my native mobile calender app
__label__3 i prefer the simplicity and organization of the old wunderlist app over this new microsoft app
__label__3 its nice enough app but synchronizing between the tablet and phone should be alot easier and more reliable than what it is
__label__1 transfer from wunderlist doesn't work
__label__3 this is by far the best and complete todo list app i have come across so far however the notification and alarm feature doesn't work would have gotten a 5 star from me if that had worked thank you
__label__3 how do i disable voice note everytime i need to write something in todo list a google voice popup came out its ridicolous stupid and annoying i couldnt find the disable option in setting
__label__5 it is a great app the only problem i have is the fact that there is no option for an specific time like for example 36 minutes etc that would make this app immensely better
__label__1 unsupported doesnt contain sync feature wouldn't issue refund to the makers and google get on your hands and knees and repent to g d
__label__2 needs a vpn if you're in china some questionable ui and design choices though the fundamentals work well for the most part if you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay of course and the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate one month is the same price as a month of netflix and a year is 47 a year of ms office 365 with all of its functionality is 60 let that sink in i don't understand why for relatively little this app costs so much greed i assume
__label__5 i like this business calender as i can colour code the information i enter on a daily basis it makes it easy to check back on my enters and also notifications for up coming events i also like the way it learns form my input and offers suggestions i probably don't use it to its full potential but it caters for my needs and i am grateful that i use it thank you
__label__3 i allowed it to do everything possible and it didn't tell me to give in my email so now i can't play the game because an email wasn't sent to me
__label__3 everything is locked repetition schedule is unable
__label__3 i used to love this app but now it has been ruined made things more complicated and v can't assign according to days of week
__label__3 its almost what i was looking for apart from is there a way to set how much xp is required to advance in level and how much xp completing a task will give you e g i want to make it so i start at level 40 in benchpress and achieving 91kg will put me at level 41 i will reach level 100 in benchpress by the time i can do 150kg completing 120kg would put me on level 70 etc otherwise the numbers are just meaningless to me really i want to set it up so when i reach my goal in each thing i am at level 100
__label__4 it is pretty good i use it everyday however i think adding recurring tasks is not very intuitive you have to remember the every syntax some ui would help especially for new users and non native english speakers other than that it's a pretty plain to do list does not include much gamification to keep you motivated to do what you have to do other than setting a general goal number of tasks to do in a day or week reporting is a premium feature which comes in pretty thin too you can only see a barchart of how many tasks you've completed each day in the past week or how many tasks you've completed every week in the past 4 weeks for what it offers the premium option feels a bit expensive
__label__3 great until last update love the app its a great tool but since the last update i frequently get server error notifications and the app doesn't function in any capacity can't chat in party dailies and habits don't refresh etc rebooting my phone and reinstalling the app did not solve the issue i'd happily give this a 5 star if this could be fixed and i could get back to my daily log ins and updates
__label__3 i loved tt and paid for premium but sooner or later their reminder will let you down you can't count on it unfortunately and it's not because of android but due to a flaw in the app if a reminder pops up and you accidentally tap somewhere else in the screen or if you're busy now then the reminder disappears and never reminds you again until you manually find this task again in the list and set a new date for the reminder
"__label__3 i can't get the widget to appear in the background wallpaper screen 
purchased the app only for that feature any help"
__label__5 the app is excellent however if you have not defined your specific goal e g i will read 5 pages of a book every night before i fall asleep you will stop using it so keep that in mind
__label__5 thank you developers for creating such a marvelous app i found app history on the link you provided below and it has all records of everything this app has really changed my life i hope to see more such apps from the developers and there are no cons or bugs i have faced till now may god bless the developers for improving the lives of people i would rate 7 stars for such a extraordinary app lots of love 3
__label__5 i recommend this app to all of my friends for studying in addition to the focus help it motivates me to get more done and to challenge myself in new ways i especially like seeing a whole forest for a day month etc sadly there was no way to transfer my plants when i got a new phone so i am having to unlock plants again
__label__4 no bad habits to simply punish me just could make good habits
__label__1 zero integration with any calendar so literally worthless
__label__5 i used to keep my to do list in a simple text file with a bullet point denoting each task to be done i decided that i needed a better way to organise my to dos and this app met my requirements perfectly with this app you can arrange your to dos in order of priority set reminders and so forth the interface is well designed and can be quickly mastered the developer has written a very useful web based help page that will enable you to get the most out of the app
__label__3 fun way to track habits it would be great if you could update tasks without an interent connection and then just sync the next time your connected like many other trackers
__label__3 would be nice if you could attach image or some file to task and event update more than a year passed still no progress on image file attachment feature although app is getting certain amount of updates feels like it's time to check out the competition
__label__3 i am apple transfer and i am yet to find am app for android with the same functionality as the built in ios app this one is ok but does not do what i need it to literally all i want an app to be able to do is have reminders pop up when scheduled then stay on the screen until they are completed this app will make the reminder pop up when scheduled but if i don't complete it by the end of the day it will not stay on my screen seems like i have to try and find a different app
__label__5 i love this app it is really useful in order to keep a schedule still i was wondering if it is possible to add tasks alone of the schedule grid and then choose the day to add it this will make easier to define the tasks yo wanna meet and then sort them along the week or add unexpected events to modify a full day schedule
__label__1 in order to use reminders you have to pay that's complete b s
__label__1 great concept but i can't even create an avatar this is a constant bug listed in reviews the company says that your selections should show up after you start actually using the app but how can they when we can't even actually choose anything i guess i'll try one of the competitors apps
__label__4 this is great help ful i get a lot more done now i love this it's a great app
__label__3 i really love the idea this app has but it has some bugs the first 2 pages are blank and when i had to make my character everything was blank too after updating the app it was still the same im using a samsung s8 if thats important hope you guys fix it cuz i'd love to use the app
__label__2 this app is a good idea and i like the fact that it is very good to start healthy habits an get organized but yet i could not do anything even with the little tutorial at the beginning this app was no help to me all i recommend is that the app has to be a bit more self explanatory i did not know how to do anything
__label__2 this is terribly buggy and you're better off avoiding it use the website instead if you're on your mobile device latest update doesn't update habit counters on screen after you press any buttons all of the command is processed though app still doesn't display items that are found just another buggy update
__label__4 great app but the widget freezes alot
__label__3 very nice very simple very usefull but the free mode is too annoyingly limited looking forward to having the ability to link habits with my wife or friends
__label__2 moved from wunderlist and am disappointed by the lack of functionally for example there is no option to show weekly tasks and to display tasks in the widget they need to be moved manually
__label__3 used to like this app a lot but recently the time input got changed from a normal clock to a spinner where you have to manually scroll through the numbers to find the time you want makes setting reminders very tedious
__label__5 so far this app works perfectly for what i need
__label__4 tells me tomorrows activities are overdue today
__label__2 no habits library
"__label__2 dates and times no such thing here sure you can colorcode and organize and 
sort your tasks to death but strangely enough there's no changing when a 
reminder will go off no setting when a task is due perhaps if you used 
this for work or a meeting or not even the ability to set a due date for 
a task it can be put in the details but when time is of the essence 
you're better off using a better task app"
__label__4 fantastic app but 4 stars every part has been a comfortable experience for me until i started trying to use it across devices i took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when i signed into my account for the app all the tasks i had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device it was partially my fault for the careless order that i signed in on the devices but perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if i wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again that said every other function provided is great and i would recommend
__label__1 all in one app free in the description press continue and there is a request for 20 99 no thanks
__label__5 just a awesome app update this app has really helped with my adhd still love the app now if i could do email from it it would be the best app i have ever downloaded
__label__5 excellent app for time management
__label__3 good
__label__1 the one thing that made this app better than the others was that it was ad free uninstalling
__label__3 any way to resize font so short events can still have a complete or at least longer than 2 words display
__label__3 good app for task but should be linked with reminders
__label__3 font is too small you have to open it up each time you want to glance at your appointments
__label__3 really good app really helpful but guys if you can change the reminder sound from notification to alarm plzz
__label__5 the app didn't work for me at first but after uninstalling a few times it eventually worked and i love it this is great for me as a college student because it makes keeping up with homework and assignments easier by adding an element of fun
__label__4 definitely helps me to stay organized a little easier i personally use it in conjunction with an old fashioned pen and paper when i have a lot to get done in a day the only complaint i have with it is that i wish i could add additional reminders for the tasks instead of having to choose a reminder time based off of a due date i set other than that it's great and easy to use
__label__3 i'm using this app for work for due diligence when i first installed the app i was sure i could search my notes for key words now i can't am i doing something wrong or is that function not available on this app
__label__4 it's relaxing makes me focused and increased my productivity so well i just wish that the trees won't cost so much coins also it would be so helpful if the whitelist is also available for free version users maybe by varying the number of apps allowed in the whitelist to make it still worth buying the premium version otherwise it's awesome thank you for this app
__label__3 love the app bt still some feature like temporary modification if somebody is late then adjustment is required and please add tasker integration for advance options if you can people will ready to pay for tasker plugin support also
__label__1 newest update to the widget made it suck there is not a reschedule button anymore which i used to use to move all my overdue tasks to a new day also no button on the widget to open up the main app anymore
__label__4 please fix the note part it always crash on my phone
__label__5 this app is sooooo helpful for me as a student to help me stay focused and productive it gives little reminders to get you back on track and it's a must for any student or busy person
__label__3 i love the concept of the app but it needs a big update to change the interface which makes it difficult for the user to interact with the app in a fun way i bought the premium version and because i really want to like this app and i think the real forest thing is really cool i'll continue using it for a while but seriously guys please improve your app
__label__4 doesn't support fossil sport watch anymore
__label__5 helpful helped me to stay on top of things as a mom with school this app makes stay on top
__label__5 brilliant i love this app my life is so easy now update i've just bought the app after using it free for 6 months i'm a driving instructor and my life has become so simple i love this app
__label__4 its good but can work on notifocation panel
__label__3 too complex as a game the time i spent tried to understanding how it work could have been spent actually working
__label__4 wish you could set tasks to recur at regular times but it's a good app overall
__label__4 希望可以开放一个正向计时的功能就好了
__label__3 app is working great except i cannot see my tasks in my calendar i'll change it to 5 stars after this synching capability is added
__label__2 good
__label__1 uninstalled once i realized there are ads and it wipes your current google calendar
__label__3 it's a good app no question about it but it's not perfect i used it for months after abandoning todoist but i'm leaving ticktick now it's feature packed but not as polished as other products the ui is not great and the app has very different design language as well as features depending on which device you open it on this lack of consistency as well as poor natural language support doesn't make it the perfect todo app
__label__4 it took me a while to understand how to use certain features but once i did i found it to be exactly what i needed if google would allow reminders to come through it would be the perfect time management tool my only thought would be if there was some sort of tutorial or guide to help know what some things were for like when i'm changing the color scheme i can't always tell what's what for those not wanting their calendar clogged up just make those things hidden after you've added them
__label__5 love this app i've been more productive since using it well designed easy and convenient to use
__label__2 this app is just impossible to use without the whitelist functionality which got removed from the free version great shame
__label__4 i like having the choice of what to add to my to day every morning it gives me a chance to review and decide what is important today one negative when you check off a reaccuring task the next scheduled one pops up every time i review the list my eye has to stop and check the little date to make sure it isn't a task for today
__label__5 best but bringing menu bar from side to below was a big mistake bc there is ad bar and then there is menu bar so its like half of the screen is gone and its so ugly ik ad bar will be gone if we pay i had to downgrade to 2 7 1 to fix it plz bring back menu bar to where it was so that i can update
__label__5 this calendar does everything i need it to do i've enjoyed this app on my galaxy s7 phone now i have an s10 content will not sync is there an s10 version i don't know about thanks for your help
__label__4 tons of features and the features i need and want however it often doesn't show my information each line just says loading it seems that most of the time they will eventually load all the permissions are good
__label__1 it has a lot of functionality bugs some of my events were not adding after restaring the app other events just disappeared etc i m really sorry i had to delete it because it looked nice and could be very useful but it s not working thanks
__label__1 this app is good but the setting is not understandable i might not even give it a single star
__label__5 cool and descent just wish to show completed things automatically each time i need to look at them also while showing completed things display it as recent first 1 to do 2 completed recent 3 past complete like wise
__label__4 i used to love this five stars before you changed it i was able to set repeatable tasks for each day of the week but now if i set a repeating task today for example for every wednesday the reminder will come up today not wednesday i want the reminder on the day i want i am very disappointed by the way i won't use any do for my grocery list i use a better one that keeps a running cost including tax for each store i go to
"__label__3 uhm there's a little bug that i encountered i cannot disable the skill 
decay pls fix i'll give 5 stars"
__label__3 it miss my data after updating i can't use it easily
__label__5 this app is awesome i get distracted so easily but once i set a timer i stay focused i will try and reach my phone when my homework gets hard but then the plant growing reminded me to get back to work afterwards you feel proud i recomend this for teen students or procrastinators
__label__2 there is a subscription to the service i wish i would have knownbefore i downloaded looks beautiful though
__label__1 used to love this app a lot but in recent times its get crashing on my mobile a lot disturbing i already send the details to the given gmail id but my problem is not solved
__label__4 thank you i love the app and it's helping me immensely already the only suggestion i can think of is i wish there was a way of keeping track of my previously completed tasks so i could look back on the progress i've made it would feel much more meaningful that way and serve as additional motivation
__label__5 very clear and easy to use app the paid version is so worth it having your daily schedule displayed on a clock is so nice for my adhd
__label__2 cancel means stop the action not throw away all the notes i just made sorry but this was suppse to save time not waste ideas and planning poor comms from app on a normalized ui function first go and really turned me off could be lots more awesome but things like this and not being able to recover the info quickly then not acceptable when doing business tasks nowadays
__label__3 awesome
__label__1 how can i get my money back
__label__2 the app does not sync with my google calendar and there is no sync option or refresh option meetings etc are not shown and i have to go back to the google calendar or acalender to make sure i don't miss anything events made on my tablet do not show on my phone please fix this it's such a great app if it just worked
__label__3 like everything about the app except my events kept disappearing i would enter an event and one would disappear
__label__5 to be honest i love this app really useful and tackles productivity in a fun way but since im traveling so much i cant have a consistent internet connection so i cant use it sadly offline use would be so appreciated even with less stuff to use sadly i know that wont happen soon
__label__5 the application is as i wanted it
__label__4 neat but i don't put that much stuff on my calendar looking for more of a scheduling tool for everyday routines don't want to add all that stuff to my calendar
__label__2 i wish there was a one time payment option and a dark mode i can't add another subscription to the msny i already have
__label__3 great app for arranging schedules and activities easy tool to teach u good productivity
__label__3 it's an interesting tool but having one or 2 things on my calendar per day it does really make sense for me to use it looks nice
__label__1 stupid app after you created list of tasks it will be removed then they will ask to restore if you buy the premium license fraud
__label__1 terrible developer said could cancel anytime believing developer installed then refuses to cancel for 7 days after first payment trickery do not dowbnload
__label__3 i have been using it for years now but the windows version is still not as perfect as android version when i open the windows 10 version of todoist the app load takes too long
__label__3 keeps me focused but i don't want to purchase anything i think it could all be free in my opinion
__label__3 very good app but i wish it can be used offline
__label__5 5 stars for being a radiohead fan great app by the way
__label__5 best to do app 1 you don't have to pay for the main things there no things to buy already 2 it is simple 3 design is fantastic 4 they have main things of any todo app list hashtags reminders my day tasks important task due date okay there are features in another todo app you won't find it here like sub sub tasks but another app you have to buy another nesscery feature like reminder so i suggest this app microsoft to do is the best to do app
__label__2 would even pay advertise but i am not able to see in one view when future stuff is taking place
__label__2 why can't i link to the outlook app
__label__1 won't even let me make a new account unusable
__label__5 easy to set up and edit i upgraded to premium so i could add more habits
__label__1 i don't want to name everything
__label__5 really useful and easy to use would be great if you could attach pictures to the notes section
__label__1 has lost features over the years back when i first used this years ago when it was called habit bull i could set goals like do this thing x times a week that doesn't appear to be an option anymore so this app has become effectively useless
__label__4 good at keeping me focused
__label__4 i give it 4 stars but needs main edits 1 there got to be alerts to remind one of the activity not just notifications 2 widget should be on lock screen beside being on the home screen 3 this app can have the option of overcoming or controlling other apps as to prevent distraction of following the routine
__label__5 great integration on google apps especially calendar attachs pictures allows you to prioritize great to have my friends have been asking how do you remember everything it's proplanner
__label__1 very sad story of being wunderlist ancestor missing drag and drop missing ux at all missing ease of using creating of new task requires your full attention for several painful seconds app that was meant to make your life easy is now just some list that force me to write my tasks on paper again after few years of using wunderlist because paper has much better ux than this one
__label__5 best timetable app but i want you suggest that upcoming timeline we can see in notification bar it makes app more better for all
__label__2 i set weekly view in settings and for few days the app worked fine but today i tried to go back to months view and i tried to access settings but when i try to do that the app closes
__label__1 if leaving a negative review is the only way to grab the attention of their non responsive support team then so be it i purchased business calendar because of its outlook calendar sync feature however the calendar requires an existing outlook account on the phone i wanted a standalone outlook connector one calendar app does a fine job there this one fails i asked for a refund the same day and sent follow up emails too but thus far no response useless support don't deserve stars
__label__3 it's been more than a year since i've requested a simple feature of counting the number of hours for certain entries in a month but there's nothing yet
__label__1 there are glitches in the android app that aren't in the web app i love the web app would give this 5 stars if todoist fixed them and introduce a bug reporting feature so that bugs like these don't remain unfixed dragging subtasks is often glitchy and doesn't parent under the correct parent task or just reorders back to original placement after i drag it to a parent task the and symbol rarely actually pops up with label auto recognition as i type like it does on the web app
__label__2 boring and not very effective for me the visual design is a bit of a yawn and it's too hard to earn rewards without paying if it works for you great but it doesn't give me enough gratification
__label__5 as a gamer this makes life fun you can make a long of lists of your daily life and gain xp and rewards you can hatch pets feed them ride mounts find a party to run with get cool gear and go on quests i can see where fun wise there could possibly in the future be expansions for more to come by all means but right now this really helps to keep on track and makes it so i actually enjoy some part of my life for the first time in a long time outside of my pets
__label__1 edit i'm using this application many year since release and i'm loved it and donate now you make this application subscription 15 a year really not happy with that
__label__1 nise
__label__3 it does not remind with a pop up notification continuously for consecutive days even when the dates are saved and the notifications are not on the home screen and therefore often missed moreover it does not remind about the task the whole day even when no particular notification time is noted this app is not dependable
__label__1 nothing work i have my calendar prepared for months and nothing come inside the sectograph even i added new one nothing appeared
__label__1 can't set up reminder
__label__3 new features update now please
__label__4 great app could be better if i could have the same habit with multiple notification times so i can do it several times a day without having to recreate the habit several times thanks
__label__5 it is an amazingly helpful app i am currently a year 11 student and this has helped tremendously boost my productivity i have seen improvements not only in my results but also me as a person as i lost lots of my bad habits and gained good ones highly recommend to anybody who wants to improve themselves non academic academic
__label__1 got a new phone and app now won't allow me to hit sign in button customer service is very slow to respond to help love the app for last 2 3 yrs but not being able to use now is not worth my paid for it to think it just renewed
__label__3 my favorite thing is when to do list speak loud the task to do is good not having to read your screen i unistalled because i miss this feature
__label__4 very good for scheduling making tasks and sorting your day considerably better than google calendar but there is a part of the app that you have to buy works fine without buying i use it on a daily basis
__label__3 could be easier to set up and save notes was confusing at first but a good app
__label__4 can you add time in notes also like events
__label__4 this is the best planning app i ever tried however i subscribed to the ads free version but i'm still getting a message telling me to subscribe to unlock the extra features i also get the same message whenever i rotate the phone to landscape mode actually the button that advertises for the full version did not go away even after buying it
__label__3 not bad still new user tho
__label__4 still need to improve on routine like day of every first week every second week of the month
__label__5 this app has a great way to keep up with and manage your life it keeps me organized and inspired to heal myself daily
__label__3 not bad still new user tho
__label__2 it is doing a strange black screen thing and randomly opens by itself other reviews have mentioned this and i suspect it is making my phone crash my phone is crashing several times a day when i remove the app it stops crashing i hope there is a fix for this it works just fine on my tablet but not my phone it's a great app due to its simplicity i switched to another planner app today and will be requesting a refund
__label__5 overall amazing pls guide me how to amend a single day activity
__label__1 worst app every can't share lists which was the whole point wunderlist was great this new app is terrible looking for another one now ughhhhhhh
__label__5 very nice app and i think it will help you with your routine
__label__1 most of my google calendar events doesn't appear in the sectograph app if i try to delete some events which is appeared it cannot remove in the app also i prefer if the app has own calendar so that events that ill creat might able show easier
__label__3 disappointed needs complete connection to your google account to work too many ads and most features don't work in the free version time wasted
__label__2 i purchased the app all i need now is to add color to the calendar entries mmh i'll think of some stuff later
__label__3 my calender does not sync with this app how can i get it to work it's great otherwise how do i sync all my calenders with the he app
__label__1 new update has performance bug very slow in scrolling down and typing update after last update now i cannot type or write anything in task description after markdown features
__label__5 streamlined attractive and functional interface my favorite app for making lists
__label__5 amazing this is the app i've needed haven't even dived into all the features yet
__label__1 imo this app is completely useless and you are better off locking yourself in a room with a clock the whole forest aspect is a scam and all the trees are super tedious to obtain depending on one's study needs and to pay premium to plnt real trees is a feel good way to buyg their product and it takes 3 days of studying to plant a tree yes i paid premium i use ecosia and i planted over 400 trees web surfing the sounds are useless too as you can get tons of sounds on other app effortlessly
__label__3 work on notifications its the best though am happy
__label__4 make sure your phone settings are allowing the app to make notifications the app works great and is super helpful the only thing i would recommend is to be able to make custom categories right now you can do other but can't specify would definitely recommend app update 2 i can't seem to find the setting that lets me see the notifications i can get it to work but only once then it stops would you be able to help me out after my first review you said you'd be able to if i needed it
__label__2 not as good as wunderlist going to need to find a new app
__label__3 is there any ways to see your progress in graphic like daily task you've done and see it in graphic stats or something because i can seems to find one in the apps or did i miss something i wsnt to know and compare my tasks daily the ui and everything is good tho except for that graphical stats daily i cant find one here dev
__label__4 great app quite simple it has a specific purpose but does it well
__label__3 it takes me about 2 3 seconds to switch between events and tasks tabs can you make it faster somehow p s app is great just what i need schedule and to do list in one
__label__3 good app and nice after the latest update
__label__3 trying to sync my calendar with both my phone and tablet and any notes and or tasks are not syncing between my devices having to duplicate these items is very frustrating
__label__3 something is wrong with the syncing i can enter events but they don't sync the google calendar will sync
__label__4 this apps quite easy to use and looks simple just it doesn't really meet my requirements it can be better if it got the calendar and tickbox i've purchased it but it still like the same it said sync to my calendar but it didn't shows what i've planned in my google calendar the only thing i am satisfield is the notification sounds
__label__1 it's completely broken things don't show up error codes from the very beginning it's just broken
__label__2 was ok until i saw the mtx i guess it truely does gamify things now
__label__2 doesn't even come close to wunderlist or any do unless you pay
__label__2 all my habits ended on 29 12 2019 it was not linked to 30 12 2019 i dunno why
__label__3 its refusing to open on a daily basis now downloading it over and over is not fun any suggestions forest has really helped me in keeping distractions to a minimum and maintaining focus update i'm still facing the same issue help a girl out
__label__3 bit complicated in adding routines i didn't understood
__label__4 excellent time management and gives you a real sense of your day i would however had liked to be able to change dates to see how other days are looking
__label__1 very bad transitioning from wunderlist can't invite others several error messages
__label__4 just after i looked at the interface i knew it was what i was searching not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books for anyone who think in terms of goals and obviously who love rpgs it's totally free though
__label__1 it seems ok but very basic recurring tasks need some work to be actually useful for example it would be nice to be able to set a task to be recurring on the first of every month without only being able to set that up on the first of the month edit i also just noticed that there is no dark theme both may be available as paid for options but i'll never know since they are basic options and without them i have no reason to try this app and thus will never pay for actual premium options
__label__1 not very user friendly uninstalled immediately
__label__3 wish it would link to my calendar so i can create edit and complete in one location that would make it 5 stars
__label__5 just about the best when it comes to getting organized and planning your day to day tasks love having the option to collaborate with others and the pomo timer is a real plus to stay focused on a specific task
__label__2 app hasn't been updated can't sync can't import habits this was a good app shame that i have to switch
__label__2 it was working ok for a couple of months then would not let me sign in funny thing is i don't remember signing out i would simply hit the icon on my android and it would just be there sure looks like it works for others
__label__4 love the app best of it's kind imo not perfect but so close this app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks if i may suggest having the 00 digits be optional and not by default when setting entering goals having multiple reminder notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day ex 200 push ups a day with 4 reminders so i can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits or the ability to group habits
__label__3 this is a lovely app but i would rather to pay one time off for using it it becomes too expensive if you use it for years doesn't connect to google tasks neither
__label__5 nice planner that replaced paper planner i absolutely love it no more spending money on etsy for digital planners that do not give me notifications this one does
__label__3 i really like the idea of this app however you'rer not allowed to use lot of useful features unless you pay and that's upsetting l
__label__3 i love the app great concept but the thing is you cant use it or it wont notify you not unless you open the app once you close the background it will lost
__label__1 slow on laptop does not sync with website no stickers on app just laptop i set up my calander on my ohone then went to desktop i can't open up my calander unlesss i give payment info on laptop i already set up payment in google play and to get to that screen takes a long time
__label__3 love it
__label__3 i really like the app but there is one feature that is to do but which syncs with microsoft account use the microsoft to do list because it sync very well with my laptop and also because it has the black theme i would also prefer to have business calender on the web
__label__3 love this planner but whenever i use the repeat function i cant just edit 1 event i have to edit the rest of the events that are linked together too would be great if i'm able to edit jus 1 event even when im using the repeat function would also be great if there's a copy and paste of events function would make things really easier
__label__3 honestly this app is not so bad but everytime i check other apps my tree doesn't die except if i close all the cards of my phone however i think it's a very good app to stop to use too much your mobile phone but i'd like more changes
__label__4 developer responded to my issue quickly and politely app is pretty good so far maybe a little more clarity is needed about the user interface for dummies like me like an arrow to indicate i can swipe for the rest of my schedule
__label__2 stupid
__label__4 just what i needed i especially love the subtasks function the only suggestion is to make the layout more compact i set up tasks on a calender using another app and they use similar fields but have a smaller popup window for setup i love your color design much better and it makes me want to open the app and update regularly
__label__3 i think the idea is pretty good but the app doesnt work too well it used to show me an alert whenever i opened a game or instagram but now it doesnt so i just start loosing time also it should be conected to the computer extension so i dont have to keep track of two different trees there's a lot of room for improval so please make the app better i still use it though but it could be so much better if it worked properly
__label__2 the app was working fine until it started bugging out recently and showing me the wrong dailies going back to using just the website now until this is fixed
__label__1 another company where the programmers have no respect for their users an exceptional app that the latest update seriously screws up
__label__3 we would like it more if there was a way to not see explicit messages on how well people are doing opened up by my 8yo caused some conversations we'd have preferred not to have at grammas so looking for a app we like as much for ease of use and that we can control the explicit messages had to delete off of her phone and will probably be following her
__label__5 powerfull easy to use active blog doing what promising even as free will give it a try and probably gonna buy i ussually read negative reviews first so small note dont understant why people complaints about tutorial having it is beneficial and frankly its quite good
__label__2 the whole app is pretty broke on the note 9 edit i would love to report the big to help however the settings menue does not work so i do not have the ability to send a report
__label__5 wow its used for my studies great please also set some features like more alarams
__label__3 i wish it had a couple of different features
__label__4 would have been a five star had something as simple as a color theme change not came with a price seriously i have to pay premium prices just to go into dark mode if i was going to pay i'm most certainly not paying now that's just too petty a thing however great concept guys
__label__5 very nice
__label__5 one of the best to do apps out there
__label__2 so for some reason now i can exit the app without killing the tree which defeats the whole purpose of this app
__label__3 you cannot check off when you have finished a task in your routine also a tad confusing tags are cute
__label__1 i got just scam rs 200 for pro version nothing happened good times
__label__2 almost what i need except there's no option to set a start end time with reminder for the start so it's useless for me
__label__4 productivity gamefied as has been said before the natural successor to liferpg looks like they just ripped the source code tbh but it irons out many of its predecessors bugs pity they monetised it in every available orifice fukugly full screen ads in app purchases for trivial customisations and an absurdly extortionate subscription all conspire to overshadow the app itself as does the uninspired graphic design and the use of unexciting headings that detract from its gaming usp
__label__3 would gladly pay for this if it was outlook compatible
__label__5 this app definitely helps me to be more focused when studying and making sure that you aren't on your phone i also think it's a great concept to make your own forest by doing so
__label__3 hey the app is great but can't deal with the constant glitches and crashes cheers
__label__2 don't like the new changes
__label__3 good app but i would like to have a feature of having a log maintained of my completed tasks so that i can go back and check when i completed them for any future references
__label__3 i really liked the app and had been using it for a few weeks but a while ago whenever i would open the app it would load for a bit but then freeze and crash if i tapped anything the rest of my phone still works fine doesn't freeze while this happens is there anything i can do to fix this i would love to continue using this app thank you and i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling edit clearing did solve the problem for now too bad i had to give up all the progress i made but thank you anyway at least i can use the app again
__label__3 great concept but there are numerous issues that i found right off the bat the main one for me was the fact that once you pick a subject for your journey you can never go back and change that i mean there are multiple journey subjects to choose from and maybe i want to focus on one aspect of my life at a time the app treats life like a game after all and most games allow you to start over with different settings starting over in this game requires you to uninstall the app reinstall the app and then create a brand new account kind of silly and frustrating to boot check out the level life up app instead it has a much better platform
__label__3 when trying to add from the widget it does not add to the selected list instead it adds to tasks very annoying this makes the widget borderline useless
__label__3 def prefer this to google calendar wish it was easier to see and switch to month view
__label__1 way too overpriced 60 per year lol
__label__5 an excellent app for everyone who struggles focusing on anything planting trees and preventing them from dying then having a whole beautiful forest is motivating there's a global ranking refreshing each week so you can compete with other players you may even plant with your friends if you want there are multiple tree species updated quite often which makes the game just more exciting i found paying for the premium version worth it
__label__2 strange thing when i mark recurrent tasks as done in web desktop version into the upcoming section
__label__5 very good app really
__label__5 as always ms makes the best thing but fails to offer video training and integration and some basic crm features needs imporvement on 1 multi importance priority level with drop down box and for sorting 2 repeat doesn't add today's to dos just an alert 3 beable to organize more than just today add wk mo yr 4 crm and calendar need upgrading and integration with outlook app 5 training
__label__4 starting days i can t tell more but its effective
__label__1 who wants to pay 3 a month the free version just tries to upsell you the premium version while you're trying to use it
__label__4 app is so cute 3
__label__5 this app is very useful minimalist yet almost everything is available i could group my activities sub activities and tasks as per my wish and use them to plan accordingly a calendar option would make it complete
__label__3 awesome idea five plus in advance although turns out there are more appealing apps interface wise but non the less it is all about insides not the outside
__label__2 the idea is wonderful but a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression for example information is slowly updated even within the application often clicking on a menu item is ignored if you create a task without a title but with a list it will become closed for editing just delete not all things are obvious i had to read help to solve simple questions well the old school 8 bit graphics not everyone likes it
__label__5 this app is fantastic i work from home anyway and with the disruption due to the coronavirus it was difficult to maintain my usual schedule by the end of the day i hadn't accomplished much and really didn't know where the time had gone i downloaded sectograph and it has made all the difference i am getting my work done and even have free time to enjoy i even recommended it on twitter yesterday
__label__4 good app useful for studies well done guys buddha also taught to love the nature as buddhist ial appreciate this
__label__2 it's google calendar with different color scheme
__label__1 nope all i ever wanted was to keep track of my stuff durring winter break and no im an eight year old and i have to enter an email please god no god save this app
__label__3 okk
__label__4 funciona bien pero si le hacen falta cosas tengo la versión premium resulta que debería existir la opción de crear categorías donde uno pueda seleccionar el ícono que más le convenga de la lista que ustedes dejen y poder asignarle el nombre de la categoría por ejemplo como sabemos existe categoría denominada study pero no se puede configurar mas de ahí sería bueno poder crear categorías con el nombre de cada materia para tener un mejor control de lo que se hace
__label__5 the simple customization of which calendars are showing with bars at the bottom of the screen is handy and the widget with a customized compact agenda has been part of my home screens for years the previous and current versions are 2 of the best app purchases i've made and certainly the most regularly used along with nine this shows my nine exchange calendars with no problems
__label__3 this app is great if you know how to use it i downloaded it and it just doesn't work for me it says it's a routine app but it doesn't really let you put your whole routine it only let's you put one reminder at a time
__label__4 the best to do app i've used by far one tiny feature design request can you please show the subtask count total and completed in the widget as well currently i need to click the task in the widget which leads me to the task screen on app which shows the subtask count
__label__4 it just works nice tight layout combines google exchange activesync well wish i could jump ahead faster than 1 mo at a time
__label__3 whilst most of he functionality is there i preferred the look and feel of wunderlist much more
__label__1 i used to love this app and have used it for a while but now nothing is synving between my devices samsung galaxy s8 and mac nothing at all no matter how many times i reset and reinstall i've tried for an hour
__label__1 uninstalled in 5 minutes it didn't populate anything that i had on my calender i even tried to manually put in events and it wouldn't show on widget
__label__2 loved this app until i recently realized that i dont use it half as much it all started w a major update if you click to put a task for tomorrow the calendar will still put you on the date of so u then have to change it to tomorrow then you have to go through not one but possibly 2 3 steps to tell it a time on an analog clock its 2019 who still uses analog clocks one step for the hour another for the minutes and another for am pm if u mess up thats it u have to start over too many steps
__label__2 i was using this app just fine without problems for about 2 months but when my wife decided to get us both a subscription my account stopped working right whenever i check off a task i just get an error message and nothing gets counted i did everything the helpers told me clear cache reinstall the app restart phone and nothing worked its been about a week and i have yet to hear again from technical support
__label__4 good concept but i don't use the app anymore as someone who is now not really a gamer the point game like concept seems to doesn't work for me anymore and maybe it's also due to the fact that i only compete with my self if i were to compete with a friend or whoever that is maybe i can keep my self accountable but that's it to it if you are a gamer this app might gonna help you
__label__5 keeps me on track with all of my many projects and the minute details of things i work on i really have a lot of projects
__label__4 could you write an option so we can backup lists to cloud otherwise this app is really handy
__label__2 non functional with google account was great but can't use right now
__label__5 great maybe best app for daily routine and habbits please add repeating tasks
__label__4 i really like this app and ised to love it until there was an update that was stopping me from using it without upgrading if i had to pay a one time purchase thats one thing but an annual fee give me a break 5 for a planner app is reasonable if you use it all of the time but not every year yall are greedy
__label__1 why was i charged 1 49 for this app i was charged 2 4 2020
__label__5 love this app this app had saved me so many stressful headaches the creator is always on top of it and so helpful with everyone's questions install this app you won't be sorry
__label__5 this app is wonderful i love that it has an option for numerical input each day it is also great that there are both individual tasks and continuous habits as previously i have had to use two separate apps for this i did pay for the premium version but i like that the app still functions effectively even if you have the free version i would love to have a visual of my progress in each habit for the past week but that is the only recommendation i can make overall this app is perfect
__label__1 36 per year for push notification reminders no thanks
__label__3 events imported from synced calendars really need to be seen in the events tab also should be able to view timeline for an arbitrary future date if they fix this the app will be great
__label__1 came back to see if i can use the app since i do like it it's a great idea i'm my case i need to be able to add calendar events reminders in one app 100 essential and afaik this isn't supported i have a shared gcal a personal and another work one and all of them needs to not only show up for me to organize life itself they also need to be managed in the app i use for reminders etc for this to do what it needs for me not just reminders calendar events needs add edit back to any do
__label__2 the only thing i can't stand is every time i get a notification i get two notifications for the same event i sure it's a setting but i can't find it
__label__2 not good no option to edit tasks or correct spellings once entered setting time and date not intuitive too many steps to make a single entry many other drawbacks not recommended
__label__4 great way to stay organized
__label__5 needed a replacement for wunderlist looked at several disappointing options before finding ticktick it has everything i liked about wunderlist plus it has nice extras like formatting in task notes and it lacks some of wunderlist's annoying behaviors it also did the best job importing from wunderlist the best alternative to wunderlist period
__label__1 loved this app until ads started covering the entire screen uninstalled immediately
__label__2 not so easy perhaps pro version may b good uninstall
__label__3 i am managing need a reminder
__label__3 i really liked it at first but it keeps turning on the alarm for my events even though i pressed no alarm i don't know how many times
__label__5 i absolutely love this app it looks amazing the dark theme is a great addition it's also really cool to be able to make lists within lists 5 out of 5
__label__5 free version has a lot of functionality but i do plan on paying after a few weeks of using it just to see if i will use it consistently
__label__2 the single franklincovey planner feature available is the task abc123 priorities system but oddly the task status system is missing no more fc system functionality as of the rest it's a very conventional pim suite with a little of crm salt pepper
__label__5 just started using it i'm very organized working from home during this pandemic is easier with the task to do list app
__label__4 like it a little even bought the pro version but when i went to the website trying to find out how do you back up your data in the event something happens to your phone
"__label__2 pro version doesn't work correctly i have more than one google account 
app keeps ignoring account used for purchase and using other account i 
have to delete gmail accounts for the app to recognize the account used for 
purchase and if i try to add the deleted accounts back the app starts to 
ignore the account used for purchase"
__label__3 good but need group list list inside list option
__label__3 the app is great for organizing and planning however the constantly crashing gets old really fast please fix this otherwise the app would be perfect
__label__4 works well the interface is a little odd you have to scroll down to see all the graphs
__label__4 app is nice it works fine i think it might just be better if it can give some rewards maybe points or what whenever you exceed your goals i also do not understand some items in the app like the red translucent thing that goes on when you tap the dates the 2nd time and why it decreases when red maybe you can make the app more user friendly i also sometimes feel offended by being catcalled by the app notifications i don't think it's appropriate still it's a great app
"__label__2 loved it until the projects feature was going to cost me a yearly fee 
honestly i wanted to try it and see if it works for me so you lost me when 
you made the features i wanted cost"
__label__5 i hope it gets better in future
__label__2 its okay
__label__3 i love the concept but i would love to see a list of suggested 'to dos' cuz i can never think of things to do
__label__3 still frustratingly basic compared to todoist i'd love to move over and consolidate within the microsoft ecosystem but there's still so many quality of life areas that are lacking in to do can i suggest starting with natural language support for setting up tasks though it makes it so much quicker to use
__label__4 my primary app for all my calendar needs it works well the pro version makes my life easier ild however give it a 5 star if i could put photos up directly into the calendar instead of loading it up as a link
__label__3 i like the app but when i open the app it always pop up to upgrade the app this is a little bit annoying since i just wanna check the to do list
__label__3 is there a way to see less weeks in month widget 6 weeks is too much for my taste 4 would be more ideal
__label__5 love it to keep track of my projects
__label__1 really no callender view without premium like really bro other apps do that for free so i think i'll just use one of those apps instead i'd get it if it was a one time purchase like a dlc in a video game but a 2 99 monthly subscription that's just ludicrous
__label__2 i much preferred wunderlist could easily copy items to new or existing folders was much more versatile why do it techies have to move 3 steps back each time something new is launched surely r d of products they wish to replace should have shown functionality used
__label__1 too much ads appeared out of no where
__label__1 at the beginning was good but i wait two months later and the app keep putting back as not done reminders that i mark as done already and the other task that have date and mark as priority don't even showed me if you can fix that ill stay with the app otherwise i will keep looking sadly the only remid app that work good was the apple one but i don't have iphone anymore so came on please make this one work
__label__1 doesn't let me add even one item to my day without buying the pro version
__label__1 not good
__label__3 too many bugs
__label__3 when i actually use chrome to study coz i downloaded books
__label__1 tried to share a list with my girlfriend who has a personal microsoft account and i have an office 365 account can't do it need to have two personal accounts or be in the same organization bring back wunderlist or similar functionality
__label__3 its good i like the little picture icons i wish for 2 things that you can share as a jpg file and not a txt file to email and that the length of the boxes represented the amount of time used for example snack time would be a short box sleep would be a long box thanks
__label__3 minimum 3 stars no real problems so far nothing to compare it to but its bright and keeping me organized
__label__5 loved it
__label__4 kinda wish price tiers weren't so high but that's not that big of a deal i guess premium is better but i can't get that at the moment so eh actually i do have one complaint i don't think syncing forest from the chrome extention to your phone should require the premium version that's just me though
__label__4 great app still waiting for rtl support and sub folders please
__label__4 have been using this now for over a year after trying a few it is absolutely the best all depends what you need it to do but it has great options and flexibility works just fine i do have a slow to load glitch on the widget on the phone other than that it's great
__label__1 the app looks nice but being forced to move over from wunderlist the import data functionality only working after the 5th try after two weeks and the web version literally becoming unresponsive when i load it tells me this app is not in any way finished or ready to be used i don't trust it to not lose my data so i can't use it thankfully other apps can import from wunderlist as well
__label__3 well done
__label__1 over complicated
__label__1 not easy to use always begging to buy pro version
__label__1 developer is non responsive for some reason when downloading the app from the play store it associates with the incorrect google account i have verified i am downloading the app with my intended account however it continually associates with the wrong account it's not really a big deal but i was planning to upgrade to premium with my play store credits the account this app associates to does not have any
"__label__4 i would love this app so much more if part of the calendar wasn't obscured 
i don't mind the week number or anything i just wish i could see both it 
and the bottom of the calendar clearly"
__label__5 can you give an option to set up timer for every task like 10 minutes or so to make us more efficient you can do it by giving us a button to start the timer and the task automatically gets checked once the time is up and if somebody wants to undo then points will be deducted is it possible in any way
__label__4 thanks to you this app makes me more concentrated and schedulable in my days and its efficient visual time widget on the home screen is really practical but sync between calendar and app is a little time consuming
__label__4 all it needs is the option to set a pic from the gallery as an icon if that happens in the next update i'll give 5 stars
__label__1 i cant even get on thing on the opening page much less start a list
__label__4 bit improvement
__label__1 need premium level to import wunderlist b s have to reset password everytime to login so haven't been able to even try the app
__label__2 requires access to contacts to work
__label__1 at the beginning was good but i wait two months later and the app keep putting back as not done reminders that i mark as done already and the other task that have date and mark as priority don't even showed me if you can fix that ill stay with the app otherwise i will keep looking sadly the only remid app that work good was the apple one but i don't have iphone anymore so came on please make this one work
__label__5 coming from 7 years of windows phone usage i was desperately looking for a widget to show daily agenda on home screen this is the far better one
__label__5 very very important app thanks to you
__label__5 amazing work done for this app i have looked for a long time for an app which was fast well developed and really easy to use keep this way always
__label__3 hell
__label__2 i purchased the app all i need now is to add color to the calendar entries mmh i'll think of some stuff later
__label__3 i downloaded this app because the other app i was using wouldn't always notify me also they recently decided to change from an analog clock face to having to scroll similar to a digital clock to set the due time i tested this app before i started copying all my tasks but i came across a problem when creating a repeat there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month ie the 3rd saturday of the month or the last sunday of the month this is a big issue for me because i have certain things i want to do but it's not always on the same date of the month hopefully this can be added changed soon
__label__4 nice configuration settings able to set most goals one setting that i couldn't get to work for me was trying to get a goal for every other day it seemed to that the goal needed to be completed every second day and comoleting it on off days didn't work the ui is slightly un intuitive as well i don't think swiping up on a goal calendar should swap to another goal it makes it hard to scroll down to the community form at the bottom if the app
__label__1 not having push notifications reminders for tasks in the free version makes the app entirely worthless and premium is far too expensive
__label__2 don't like it much event task favorites at the bottom confusion entering data is tedious too selected hide for completed task it may have deleted them need simple customization features and i hate the computer time task settings which it uses pros easy to read overview thx mbf
__label__1 the new version is too complicated to use and i could not find any directions however a application with a easier use will be my preference
__label__1 only certain google calendar entries show in the sectograph making this absolutely pointless a great idea that is flawed in execution
__label__1 used to be awesome now i can't sync log out or save changes made to habits the quotes is stuck on same one i have changed passwords uninstalled and reinstalled emailed your company and all but deleted app as it no longer keeps record please resolve
__label__3 good app
__label__5 i was a longtime wunderlist user and briefly switched to microsoft todo after i found out it was going to be gobbled up by microsoft after realizing that everything had to be within the microsoft world to take advantage of full todo functionality iditched it and discovered ticktick i would have used ticktick from the get go if i knew it existed this is an awesome app
__label__1 app is a pain to sync not user friendly in this regard used wunderlist for years then ms took them over and ruined it
__label__4 i really like this app some things could improve like the quote box fitting the whole quote in it and the colors being more distinguishable thanks
__label__1 often freezing and crashing when i wanna add photos to task help or give my my money back no support response tasks in calendar easy prioritization only usefull app in shop
__label__5 simple and amazing
__label__5 excellent app
__label__3 update 02 04 20 i was using this for a while but i returned to my old task manager of 15 years updated versions of course i like this out because it syncs between android and my macbook pro works a charm only issue doesn't handle recurring tasks such as recurs on the second tuesday of the month etc simple recurring tasks are fine every second monday overall very good easy to use once recurring tasks are implemented completely this will be superior
__label__3 awesome
__label__1 it's an okay app
__label__3 great app keeps things organized my request is that changes should be saved automatically rather than having to press save like in google keep i forget to save it before leaving the app usually because i am in a rush and so things don't get updated this feature would help a lot
__label__2 the interface is great and i love it overall however i'm giving it two stars because it won't synchronize between my samsung phone and ipad despite being the same account information for each i emailed their support like about this and they asked for my login info but i never heard anything back this is a huge inconvenience because i put a lot into the version on my ipad and i dont and wont do it twice for the same application once this is fixed i'll happily increase the rating
__label__2 i liked it when i first got it several years ago but after installing it on several devices i found it does not sync with the other instances of it after getting no response from their support desk i uninstalled the three apps from the three devices and reinstalled them using my google account in case i had not logged in with the same account on all the three new instantiations do not sync the help desk is non existent the idea is good but the app is defective
__label__1 not sync with google calendar
__label__1 plz change the orange color in dark theme to blue
__label__3 too many features are premium and that's kinda annoying still like the app though
__label__5 excellent
__label__1 ugly ui jiss fb login dosent work
__label__4 this is closest to my expectations
__label__5 i've had this app for over 3 years and paid a very small price for it and i couldn't be happier quick setup reminders the way you want them and easy on the eyes when you change colors to your liking
__label__5 please support midnight cutoff display
__label__2 it's good that you can import from wunderlist but the planner is missing some really basic features for instance it's impossible to set a repeating reminder which makes it pretty useless and why 'my day' doesn't automatically populate with the things you have set for the day is beyond me poorly thought out as i am finding a lot of microsoft products are these days i'm looking for a better app
__label__2 please fix the whitelist bug instagram isn't included in my whitelist however i can still open it without this app stopping me like it used to
__label__4 great app quite simple it has a specific purpose but does it well
__label__3 it's a very efficient and useful app but i'm disappointed in the stats function it started out lagging a day behind fair enough but now it's at least 5 i like having stats to motivate me and this feature is now useless
__label__5 i love it help me organiza my plans
__label__4 easy and simple to use
__label__2 maybe it works for some people but this was absolutely the worst 'to do list' app i have tried every time i opened it therr was a 'feature' blocking my use the ultimate problem was finding no task delete function
__label__3 i bought the allegedly better version it worked for about a month i had all my scheduled stuff about 6 months and all of a sudden the disappeared which sucks
__label__1 not as advertised
__label__2 it was so good and then the pc version became extremely annoying overnight i'll add tasks in a project the app will sync and move the task to an entirely unrelated project on its own and sure i can reassign it but i didn't have to before and that's just an annoying waste of time i don't mind waiting for it to get fixed but i might just start looking for a new app which sucks because i really liked this one
__label__2 buggy as hell keeps duplicating events when i edit them leaving me with the old version and the new side by side i keep deleting the old one and it keeps coming back i'm irritated and i'm going to look elsewhere now i loved the original business calendar but after giving it more then a fair chance this version is a no go
__label__5 well designed simple yet powerful task list app has a great web app too which works beautifully in tandem with the smartphone app use it on a daily basis and has also proved to be the best place to consolidate all my other lists you know the never ending list of lists that seems to keep growing
__label__1 the app does not work after last nights update
__label__1 ok
__label__4 it worked fine for a while but now every time i click on a task habit goal to edit the app crashes i can tick off the task and plus on the habit just fine but i can't edit anything now please look into fixing it soon edit thank you the latest update fixed it all
__label__1 i really want to use this app but on my galaxy s10 the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in are blank the character visuals on the character customization are invisible and on the settings menu i scroll down and the options start to overlap each other hard to describe i will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app but currently it's unusable for me
__label__1 does not sync with google task list unless you pay 2 99 month or their annual rate quite disappointed since their beautiful platform does not meet minimum sync options of google task lists i only found out that u had to purchase a task sync option after i connected to my gmail account not cool at all b c it felt like a misleading bait and switch and now solicitor that i have to block because i synced my email to attempt what it said that it was able to do sorry tick tick but
__label__3 appearance good sometimes lags and don't update the time even after an hour
__label__4 i live this calendar app but i wish it was a widget
__label__3 work on notifications its the best though am happy
__label__1 complicated dislike the pro version microft to do list is better
__label__5 awesome
__label__3 more hierarchy on task options
__label__4 i love this app and use it constantly but there doesn't seem to be a way to add subtasks in the app i don't have access to the desktop version other than that great app
__label__3 i wish to have flexible goal like do xx minutes exercise per week month
__label__1 in this app it is very hard to use
__label__2 not too good for android i have the app in my two different type of phones and subscribed for the premium one month in my android and found out that that version doesn't have all the features described as for example impossible to find or use the sub task feature create or editing folders etc etc very disappointed about that because the app concept seems to me very good
__label__4 good app wish there were more customization
__label__1 it gives the option to add a local calendar but doesn't let you use it unless you also give permission to use a google or outlook calendar kind of defeats the purpose of doing a local only calendar if i can't actually use it
__label__5 its very good and notify every time by time to do fixed routine
__label__1 this app doesnt sync data
__label__2 i really like this app enough to purchase the premium a few years back but the app didn't update to premium for me and there was no response when i contacted the support seems like i'm not alone in this experience don't put your trust in the developers
__label__5 great
__label__2 doesn't show a content of reminder on locked screen even if its correctly set in the settings fix it and i'll change my rate btw google calendar knows how to wake up a locked screen and show notifications
__label__3 overall a well designed app that i would otherwise use except for the lack of google assistant integration a la todoist
__label__4 this app is great to organize your day or make shopping lists etc but sadly i don't get notifications even if i turned them on i hope this will be fixed soon
__label__3 it takes a lot of menus and selections to add anything to your list
__label__1 took too long to sync uninstalled
__label__3 i'm find this app useful but i'm trying to use it on my desktop is there a way to check off items on my laptop in this app i will change my score once answered thanks
__label__1 and once again here we have another app that gets worse with every update over complicating things if it ain't broke don't fix it i get what they are trying to do but it has made it less user friendly and more restrictive i wish i could revert back to the previous version currently considering going back to the previous app i used to use
__label__3 great concept unfortunately sometimes a bit buggy implementation really weird back stack handling and syncs don't work quite often staying with it for now hoping on things to be fixed in the future
__label__2 it doesn't show reminders not much useful without reminder display support
__label__3 looks nice but no cal dav task sync
__label__4 i just installed this gem of an app this morning and love its ease of use however there is a minor problem the date in big numbers on the left is one day behind the monthly calendar
__label__2 i have used this app for a few years and loved but what have they done with the app the major update in december has made adding moving tasks harder thus makes me less productive edit to answer can't always change projects with a simple the gui is cluttered with too much going on when i tap on a task i used to tap out but when i do it comes out of edit mode goes to the top and i have to back out again to get to list view
__label__3 this apps not suitable for my needs the reminder keep show every day even the task mark as 'done' everyday i do click 'done' at reminder the next day and next day and next day the reminder still come up the logic for the apps does not make sense for me i'm not a paid subscribber
__label__3 looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to i would reconsider if the paywall wasn't a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase
__label__5 works well for what i need
__label__2 good idea but i don't like that it wants internet access
__label__4 cute
__label__1 any app that ignores your phone's dark mode unless you pay for it is garbage
__label__3 my life is a game and i should quit to desktop lmao
__label__5 great app thank you so much and love u forest stay focoused app developers because you do a great work for humanity great application for students and other person who want to analysis your work time i love app so much once i get a job i buy a pro version thank you developers
__label__4 very good sometimes aggressive advertisement
__label__2 very bad app i organised all of my activities took me 1 hour to complete my planner then realised that the app automatically sets the time at am so all my afternoon activities where at the morning for example if i had to eat at 1pm it said that i had to eat at 1am so i changed them to pm and suddenly the app errased my whole schedule wasting 1 hour
__label__2 it is fun but now i just level up and i don't get any notifs for unallocated stat points anymore
__label__5 awesome experience
__label__3 ive downloaded all the calendar apps out there and i like this one the most however it needs to show the text on the widget not just a dot such a bummer because i thought i found the one please fix this youre so close to being the goto app for calenders for the switch off of the stock android calender eagerly awaiting the update 5 stars and a great review once you do it
__label__4 love the reminder to log your habits
__label__2 it's a good app but it doesn't really work for me please provide an offline mode because not everyone has data and wi fi throughout the whole day i will rate it 5 stars once there is an offline mode
__label__3 i am hating the experience now this app was so great untill it started missing on my tasks reminders and its crazy i couldn't get a very important task done that i put a reminder to here and i have allowed tick tick all the functions it needs but this reminder thing its pissing me off please get it fixed
__label__3 so i really like this app probably one of the best planner apps out there but i ended up uninstalling it because it kept asking to pair with my google account and the pop up was rather aggressive the cancel button didn't work and it would pop up after every single action even after going to the settings to try to sync it with my account i didn't see a way to sync it i do really love this app it's great but that pop up just ruined it
__label__1 needs a pure black theme for the app and widget
__label__5 love it gotten through a bunch of essays with this app i love it actually let's your phone play music which i always turn on before starting the timer i do have one complaint and it is a small one though i think there should be breaks during the timer i've needed to use the restroom a lot during studies and i feel guilty because i'm wasting time so i think there should be a 5 minutes break option maybe you're only allowed to use it once or twice per tree depending on the time it took
__label__5 good
__label__3 i am hating the experience now this app was so great untill it started missing on my tasks reminders and its crazy i couldn't get a very important task done that i put a reminder to here and i have allowed tick tick all the functions it needs but this reminder thing its pissing me off please get it fixed
__label__3 приложение поиграться на неделю максимум геймификация очень слабая покупать платную версию не рекомендую
__label__3 i have been using this app on my samsung for last 2 years i have found good in it it's a good app for reminders and to do list now i have changed to oppo a9 the only issue i am facing the reminders notifications which are not completed disappear from my screen in the night same day it's annoying for me because i have to find those incomplete reminders in the app one by one and set them again it would be fine if unfinished tasks should not disappear stars would be 5 thanks
__label__4 nice app
__label__2 had been using this app without glitches for quite a while now but the last update prevents me from opening it anymore
__label__1 a really great app helps me focus significantly but i keep running into an error message when i try to upgrade to the pro version which makes it very frustrating i have spoken to the google play store and emailed your support team about this to no response please help i would like to support a great app such as this
__label__4 great app but the widget freezes alot
__label__3 it is an extremely good app but it keeps crashing have installed it for the 3rd time in 2 days
__label__1 first the app changed my task name then the task just disappeared and was not in the app bad app
__label__5 good app helpful and easy to use
__label__4 love this app only thing that bothers me is that when i put repeat on events it only works sometimes so just make sure it actually fills in the reoccurring days that you choose
__label__4 i like all the scheduling possibilities and tools i'm giving it 4 stars because the alarm i have set thru the app can't be turned off i had to uninstall it just to get it to turn off very annoying
__label__3 very interesting concept but it's extremely time consuming to setup and add all the content you need also being able to edit everything and choose the rewards freely kinda looses it's purpose i understand some people might like the feature but i personally do not overall great app if you have the time to set it up and get familiar with it
__label__3 it's a great way to make a to do list but it never gives reminders when i want it to
__label__1 i wanted to delete one item pressed a millimetre too low the whole list is gone about a hundred items lost this alone makes the whole app unusable for me months later still this same fatal flaw seems like ms have no interest in improving this app sadly
__label__2 very buggy first few times that i've used the app repeatedly having to close and reopen it for it to properly work
__label__2 i love the idea but there are syncing issues events take forever to show on the graph regardless of whether i entered them in the sectograph app or my google calendar they show up in my google calender almost automatically regardless of the same also i think 12 hour clock makes it tricky to read since the switch from am to pm is in the middle of the day i have something starting at 12 30 and i cant see it on the sectograph but there is a little arrow at that start time with the first letter of that event and nothing else it's confusing
__label__3 too many items
__label__1 this is a great planner but i'm really annoyed that having previously paid for the pro version i am now expected to pay an annual fee
__label__1 mar 2020 very very disappointing looking elsewhere before a move forward from wunderlist not ms made sure the ui looked different with useless themes and dropped wunderlist functionality like 1 email delivery marked stuff in outlook is useless to people that don't use it 2 no way to add tasks by widget notifications 3 marking a task with a star doesn't move it to the top 4 my day shows up rather than a task list 5 out of review space i detest progress that isn't
__label__4 tasks todo is a work in progress nevertheless it is very handy and i am happy to have it i'm a former wunderlist user i believe the app developer will continue to tweak tasks todo not that it's not helpful now i do miss the deleted items not being hidden under the category of tasks they came from this was very handy for shopping especially groceries other places i shop for i could peruse my completed list for things i may have forgotten thanks so much continue the good work
__label__3 there's nothing wrong with this app although it could be slightly better but it's just like google calendar in fact it's integrated with google calendar and all your events show up in gc even the selections of colors in association to events and how you input information is the same if you're an android user go ahead and just use the built in google calendar if not your samsung htc whatever one i have near stock android so i get google same difference really
__label__3 i love this app but who in the world thought this new scheduler was a good idea it takes forever to set up a time now please please please bring back the clock round scheduler back
__label__3 i really like the paid version of the app the only request i would have is i use this app for pomodoro 25 min bursts during the work week and i miss having the full tree image is there a settings option to change this
__label__5 it was so easy to use
__label__1 trash dont waste ur time unless u want to pay for the things that should b free
__label__3 but can't really test this out since i'm tied with habitica oh yeah i personally don't like the avatars though it'd be nice if to upload your own avatar oh just saw other people suggest the same lol
__label__3 this app is pretty good and works well but i was wondering if you could make the designing as well as the app on the web
__label__5 i really like this apps it is so easy to use
__label__3 i prefer wunderlist since you can move around the tasks but app doesn't allow that flexibility only broad sorting features
__label__1 i used past 5 years nice app but now more advertisement so i uninstall the app
__label__1 wew
__label__1 all i want is a calendar this app spams you so much 1 star
__label__1 can not cancel my membership
__label__2 crash crash crash always
__label__4 make sure your phone settings are allowing the app to make notifications the app works great and is super helpful the only thing i would recommend is to be able to make custom categories right now you can do other but can't specify would definitely recommend app update 2 i can't seem to find the setting that lets me see the notifications i can get it to work but only once then it stops would you be able to help me out after my first review you said you'd be able to if i needed it
__label__1 forced to move from the fantastic wunderlist import fails that's an import of 100 pieces of text on a modern mobile phone pitiful
__label__1 nope nope nope
__label__2 its still asking me in an ad on the app to upgrade not cool
__label__5 exactly as i expected
__label__4 i like this app and it's really helped but now i can't open it anymore it crashes while loading every time i've tried troubleshooting restarting deleting the cache but nothing seems to work
__label__5 the only calendar app i have used for several years i occasionally check on google cal and others but none have reached the same of features and presentation
__label__3 love it
__label__3 it's suitable for reminders and tasks if you're already in the microsoft office 365 ecosystem i just don't need another account based service to make grocery lists
__label__3 was looking for something which syncs with google tasks
__label__4 nice app but haven't been able to explore it's full potential
__label__3 it has great promise but i cant use it offline so its worthless to me
__label__4 would be great to customize the alarm i want to test pavlov effect with supplements
__label__1 foolish app steals data doesn't have anything of itself takes everything from google calendar
__label__4 tried several of this type best of bunch for me after last upgrade widget date not automatically rolling over to next day
__label__5 this app is practical beautiful fun and easy to use highly recommend
__label__4 great calendar bought the pro version for the previous version just annoying to have to purchase again otherwise would definitely buy the pro version
__label__5 this is an amazing app that helps the environment and helps you stay off your phone so really its a win win
__label__1 too expensive
__label__3 this app is a tiny and easy to master planner and organizer the interface is neat and it has amoled dark theme everything is fine until i noticed that repeating tasks are not being repeated when there is no internet connection which is for a traveller is a hassle i wish repeating tasks can be repeated again on the next day once checked even if the device is not connected to the internet
__label__3 the only problem i have come across so far is the day calendar does not change automatically in order to get the current date on the day calendar is to go to the month calendar and select today's date that said the program and ui is better than the pre installed calendar program
__label__2 why does my theme switch from dark to light every time i open the app
__label__4 amazing calander but lately there are too mamy adds a lot more than before still willing to deal with it though
__label__2 seems to work great for me but my family have trouble accessing the app having to log into their microsoft account every single time get it together microsoft it's frustrating and ridiculous
__label__4 this app seems awsome and it is just mabe a touch up on sound otherwise i love it this is exactly what i needed
__label__2 ver y often the application does not open you sen question and ask what is happening and you get no replied roger j sanchez from miami
__label__1 slow on laptop does not sync with website no stickers on app just laptop i set up my calander on my ohone then went to desktop i can't open up my calander unlesss i give payment info on laptop i already set up payment in google play and to get to that screen takes a long time
__label__2 acalendar business calendar tiny calendar tick tick pro acalendar's design featurr and logic is from 2004 business calendar is better but still stupid and feels like from 2010 tiny calendar really improves from the 2 above nice modern design and good drag drop feature but still suffers the same wrong logic and bad design as business calendar tick tick is the modern calendar that wins because its designed with modern logic designed with proper modern features less touchpoints and jus
__label__3 this cannot sync outlook
__label__5 nice but widget needs some more improvement as tapping on it does not open the main application by the way superb interface
__label__3 would be nice to once you delete one thing that it would not ask if it's the series
__label__2 it needs me to pay again for the app once i've updated this app the drag and drop feature had just gone suddenly silently
__label__3 hmm i just don't like it
__label__5 todoist has always been one of the most useful apps for me i have migrated to offline world recently and have decided to plan my works in my journal instead of todoist and gcal however still i needed a listing app after a bunch of search between the apps todoist is still the best app i can use for making lists by the way i should ignore some of its features like daily goals and replace the term of project with list in my mind but it is a perfect choice for me
__label__4 good program
__label__3 this app has been very helpful in the past i haven't enjoyed the most recent update though hence the 3 stars if i close the forest app so it's not an open tab it doesn't send me back to the forest anymore i haven't changed any permissions it's all exactly the same it allows me to bypass the system which isn't helpful at all please figure it out with the next update i would like my forest app back
__label__3 i love this app i bought the premium version last year and i still can't synchronize my data i have to change my phone and i will lose all the data could you fix that
__label__4 good and useful
__label__1 zero integration with any calendar so literally worthless
__label__4 nice app would like further customization for habits such as perhaps scores the better you tackle a habit healthier eating today than yesterday resulting in a higher score this would make the app much more useful for me otherwise great app
__label__1 recurrent tasks don't work
__label__3 why it is not giving me notifications for dailies
__label__3 this is a good planner because it's easy to use and understand but the widget consumes a lot of the phone's battery
__label__2 i think this app is the best option for a to do list except that the sync is terrible i just paid for premium and the app will not sync during the trial the sync between android app and pc app was also very bad if they could get the connection sync issues fixed it would be a great app if i can't access the premium features i paid for in the next few hours i'm going to be requesting a refund
__label__3 i love the widgets for this app but there are some synching quirks that drive me nuts not sure if it's the app or the stock google calendar but whichever it is it's not a good combination
__label__4 i really enjoy this app because it stops me from sitting on my butt 24 7
__label__5 its the place where i take notes of my homework and projects i've got to do so pretty useful for me
__label__3 looks promising would like to see routine sharing sync some routines you have to do with your wife marking activity as done have tags on timers and have more analytics on the actual timeline data not routines i personally would pay a premium for these features
__label__3 the widget is not updating automatically
__label__5 super useful for the lockdown
__label__3 if all you want is to make lists or be reminded of something once then this is a great app but if you want a reoccurring reminder forget it it won't recreate the reminder for the next occurrence once you complete the first occurrence
__label__2 very bad
__label__3 not able to open events into another calender app it always opens events in my native mobile calender app
__label__1 wunderlist is way better and simpler why is this so complicated i dont need another complicated app to update that is hard to read just copy wunderlist exactly i dont need 4 categories my day tasks etc all i want is one area to see all things due today or overdue not a bunch of extra list to sort through
__label__3 great app but the update has ruined the functionality of the widget i can no longer figure out how to select multiple tasks and it is no longer possible to go straight to the app from the widget these are to important features for quickly making more complex changes to your schedule the widget could be improved otherwise the app is great
__label__4 why i unable to sync the apps in my phone
__label__2 i love how personalisable this app is and the widget is fantastic the weather app doesn't always work and my tablet and phone won't sync tasks even when i ask it to manually
__label__3 nice app
__label__5 satisfied but to me too little functions for free version i'm not able to judge whether i'm ready to pay for full version
__label__4 very effective for every day tasks but once a week or once every x number of days is a bit confusing to set up
__label__2 calendar sync for a productivity app is a pro only feature
__label__3 excellent app
__label__1 i cannot even create an account i fill in what's needed and i'm pressing the button and it's not working some1 help
__label__1 cant add widget to home screen configured the app added task list and tried to drag the widget to home shows up nagging popup to select theme etc does nothing even after configuring the app won't recommend it
__label__1 absolutely hated it it was just weird
__label__3 very helpful with lots of features i would like to see the countdown mode work on the widget too though also it would be delightful if we could add tasks like the notification with a button shortcut such as pressing the home button for some time and the prompt would pop up but still nothing i would pay annually though
__label__3 unable to give color to events only blue color is coming
__label__2 wish i can repeat sirten things without spending money every year
__label__5 i have never seen any other tasks or to do list that has so many options functions available i am really impressed and appreciate this app
__label__5 love it
__label__1 bad transfer from wunderlist resharing lists is time consuming order of items on lists is not preserved looks like it at first until you add something to a list and then it appears at the end bottom of the list not at the top must then sort by order of creation date which throws everything out of wack if you had items ordered by importance or any other custom order
__label__4 this planner pro is very nice and better for you time schedule
__label__2 i don't want make an account before trying out the app give us a week trial before making us sign up please
__label__3 easy to use and keep my tasks in check love that i can have different sub tasks for different projects though i wish they could vbe color coded so as to differentiate them
__label__2 a recent update broke existing home screen widgets it also made it impossible to create thin widgets the minimum width is now 4 units which basically takes up the whole screen
__label__3 got this loved the free version paid 3 99 for pro and still don't have the ability or can't figure out how and there are no instructions to set different calendars on two widgets on my phone i'll be happy to give you 5 stars if you send me a how to also it says there is time tracking does that mean i should be able to do a start stop on something while i'm doing an activity
__label__3 ever since the new update that came out today i have not been able to use forest every time i try opening the app is says forest has stopped is there any way to fix this
__label__3 i really like the app but there is one feature that is to do but which syncs with microsoft account use the microsoft to do list because it sync very well with my laptop and also because it has the black theme i would also prefer to have business calender on the web
__label__5 moved to ticktick when wunderlist announced it would become microsoft todo i'm loving it so far better than wunderlist specially the web app
__label__4 great app but annoying that it limits the number of lists you can make i can understand limiting shared lists on the free version but not regular ones functionally it's great though i would pay a one time fee to open the pro functions but not ongoing fees
__label__2 not competent at scheduling recurring tasks are automatically completed if not checked by the scheduled time there is no way to know if you missed it the interface is pleasant though
__label__2 this is exactly the app i was looking for to visual my day as the clock face just makes sense however only being able to add to the schedule via external calendar apps makes this completely unusable i tried to use it to better manage my routine but my calendar app became so full of menial tasks that i was unable to see my upcoming appointments and events of most importance it has amazing potential but is currently only good for basic planning very disappointing
__label__4 would be great to customize the alarm i want to test pavlov effect with supplements
__label__1 nothing is free very bad
__label__4 i am using this appa past few months seems good to me this apps helps me in organising my stuff i love it
__label__5 love love love this its the best of both worlds paper and digital and syncs with all your calendars awesome app
__label__3 i paid for the premium version but all my habits records was deleted without explanation they fix that problem
__label__3 i sadly had to uninstall this app as tgere was no general opt out option for direct marketing activity i could opt out of seeing personalised ads on this app i couldnt opt of my data being collected and combined with other sources and shared by all of their many advertising partners which for an app like this is just too invasive very saddened as the app does look really good
__label__4 all good
__label__2 it wouldn't let me in
__label__3 great but basic in design and you cant not preview things such as sound its basic to use but some features are a little annoying like all the tags in one place id like the option to categorise
__label__2 cant really set custom remindere for example i need to be able to check a specific system every 3 hours with other variables cant do it
__label__2 i have had this for years and even have the pro version today the application is staying i do not have pro when i go to on app purchase it even detects purchased but will not give access to pro features
__label__3 i would really appreciate if dev focus on improving existing features like natural dates and time rather than adding new features
__label__3 i've recently started using ticktick so far so good it would be nice if you could alphabetize the items checked off so that they are easier to find when you want to add them back to your list i haven't found a list system that does that yet
__label__3 its a nice app but i always accidentally deleting a task when scrolling side to side please remove the delete feature when scrolling between tasks thanks
__label__4 does not include connectivity with google tasks or similar tasks software which is at least for g calendar users lamentable the very idea and design are superb though
__label__2 keeps crashing
__label__1 there is an issue in syncing and the events are lost in few mins post adding it the app could have had their own calendar without syncing to android calendar please improvise
__label__5 fun way to track your chores and get small challenges to get better nice idea good app thumbs up
__label__3 the app work just fine it was my commitment that had problem
__label__4 love this app but it only lets you keep track of only 5 habits at once for more you have to buy premium but other than that its great
__label__5 i love it one thing i had a problem with earlier was that if i didn't have internet connection it wasn't possible to log my dailies in now i have unlimited data so this isn't a problem for me anymore but might be worth solving this for other players everything else is just wonderful and a big help to life organization for scattered mind people like myself
__label__2 great concept but can they hire an artist this artwork is outdated otherwise i would use this
__label__2 i had a reminder set with a certain sound it never went off
__label__5 niceee it help me alotp
__label__2 your condescending attitude is not helping yor case there is a sublist reorder but nothing for the main list there is no sort of any kind says sort by do date or lets you pick what to sort by a logic choice completed tasks need to change imiediately so you know it's completed next month is set i didn't say it wasn't simple the interface is not very intuitive i did look at help there is little for the main list you are very irritating so i am going to try other choices
__label__3 i would've liked to use this app but sadly it doesn't seem to recognize european daylight saving time i've gone through the settings twice this is a deal breaker i'm afraid i would still recommend people try the app however if the live in location where dst is rightfully ignored the main concept is really clever and the widget is beautifully designed
__label__3 it would be motivational for me if i can set the start date of my goals
__label__3 i have a big problem with this app daily routine doesn't repeat unless i complete it but somtimes i really could not complete it then it's stop repeating why plz fix it
__label__4 i liked the app very much i signed up and so with the hope that my to do list would sync with all devices but when i reinstalled the up after cleaning my phone everything disappeared
__label__5 excellent features sync with google calendar and easy for multiple users reminder feature excellent makes remote organisation of diaries a breeze
__label__2 great concept but really quite bad execution with so many bugs even in the new player introduction it feels like an early access not v2 2 of anything surprised to learn that it's been in public release for 4 years now i would be ashamed to make or spend money from any transaction within this game i'm not usually this harsh and i hope none of the devs take this review personally but get it together needs a major qol ux overhaul before i would consider the concept v1 0 complete
__label__1 decent app but repeatedly asking me to pay a monthly subscription for a fancy to do list is completely unacceptable take no for an answer
__label__1 this app deleted my whole google calender
__label__4 this is an excellent application the interface is fresh and new and provides a new way to look at your day i only wish that it could be made to be resized a little larger as well as show all day events below in a list format as they are small around the bezel apart from that it is a solid 5 stars
__label__3 please provide a 'today' smart list that shows items due today it should not be necessary to manually add tasks to a today list that's a waste of everyone's time
__label__4 its a good calendar definitely bettwr then most and if they keep up ill continue to use it they also are constantly improving the app i'm having difficulties getting it to open on the correct day i'm sure it's just a setting i can't figure out the app keeps opening on a day for days from the current day
__label__3 it doesn't sound for notification even i had set every options like alarm tone vibrate etc plz reply
__label__4 very good well it's a great app i just wish we had more free features it would be a rmgrest investment
__label__4 gud for organised businessman
__label__4 all to do lists should embrace habit monitoring also i like it when a pending task persists on the list until it's done or removed
__label__1 will not accept passcode after today's update have been a paid user for some time and need my info back please fix and i will update my review useless to me until resolved
__label__4 i've been using rhis app for a few weeks i have a pixel 2 xl pros great app user friendly easy to use group tasks i love that you can rearrange tasks bases on your preference im an entrepreneur with many projecrs and it def keeps me on track cons i wish it could track the amount of time i spend on each major task sub task like a time clock is this a possibility in q1 or q2 of 2020
__label__3 missing key features cross platform
__label__5 very nice app i like the fact i am able to log in any type of event in the calender and track your progress
__label__1 i love it except and this is a big issue for me it's totally server based want to update anything but have a bad internet connection too bad it's either going to take forever or fail i would use and maybe even pay for this app to just have a way to have everything first be saved on my device so back to hunting for a to do app edit 3 23 i have to drop my review on this to 1 star you can manually edit values within the app for stats making any it unreasonable that i need internet
__label__5 best app i have downloaded thus far keeps all my task organized with a easy to use app and no annoying ads highly recommend
__label__3 please reduce the font size in widget so that more items can be shown in a smaller window there are not so many options so it shouldn't be any issues with click target size etc check how google calendar widget shows information in agenda mode
__label__1 deleted app due to not putting things in i was looking forward to using this app i am getting the same issues as sharlyn
__label__5 very useful keeps me on track with my revision
__label__3 i've been actively using this and i love the concept app version could really use a new ui dark mode would be appreciated and maybe letting users adjust font or size of boxes feels too large right now it would easily hold more details but space is lost to a big box
__label__3 good but preferred wunderlist before microsoft bought it out
__label__4 easy to work with
__label__2 it's confusing
__label__3 needed a standalone platform which does not connect to any of my calendars
__label__1 this is a loser upgraded to premium without my permission for a free trial no option in the app to return to free option and i'm maxed out on tasks on the premium will delete before i pay for premium prior review migrated from wunderlist seamlessly much more cumbersome compared to wunderlist
__label__1 i am also looking to change after years of usage the app stooping to advertising unless a new upgrade is paid is dishonest i paid for my old version and was satisfied with its functionality not interested in your new version
__label__3 would be better if it didn't rely solely on google calendar great concept but would prefer adding events directly to the clock myself rather than having to put it on google calendar first
__label__3 a great app has some kinks that need ironing and i'll update when they're done but i love this app and use it daily as intended
__label__3 okk
"__label__3 i would like it better if you could add days of the week that would be 
super helpful for example i only workout monday thru friday so if i could 
have it remind me monday thru friday that would be super helpful"
__label__1 doesn't popup reminder anymore with android 10 update revert by support claiming its purely android 10 issue isn't true there are apps which continue to have pop ups shared with developer who refuses to acknowledge this only give defense of android issue
__label__4 i used this all the time before and it was fun in the beginning but got really tired of the low res graphics if they were a bit more high def it would be amazing we could finally see the equipment customization better more motivating to continue using and complete tasks
__label__3 bull i've been using it for 2 weeks and it's okay except for the fact that the widget doesn't work most of the time i have to open the app directly to be able to list activities which renders the widget useless i paid for the upgrade which makes this issue all the more frustrating
__label__1 uninstalled it interferes with my normal google calendar
__label__5 i downloaded a bunch of habit tracking apps to test them out before new year's habitbull seemed the most intuitive and straightforward i really like the design shows the streak on the calendar and the fact that it nudges you if you don't check in during the day there's even a community function where you can share the struggle with others doing the same thing great app
__label__1 absolutely terrible most unless app i have downloaded to date
__label__5 very good
__label__2 hi i can add just 1 event why i try to add more in google calendar it shown but in this app it's not show up
__label__3 i'd really like to use this app but there's no option to sync with other calendar services like microsoft's
__label__5 good app user friendly
__label__3 it was a very nice app until it started lagging so much just planted a two hours tree and the app deleted it as if i had done nothing
__label__3 really like the app however it is multiplying my tasks on a daily basis and i cant delete them as fast as they appear frustraring not using it right now
__label__3 not all can afford premium for reminder
__label__3 it's good but everytime i mark a task as completed on the widget i have to open the app and tell it to sort my tasks by date again you guys should include a setting to choose how you want your tasks ordered and reorder them by that setting everytime cause it's annoying having them reorder themselves in a way i dislike constantly
__label__1 can i get a refund
"__label__2 firstly this app often has been stopped i've tried to do something to fix 
it but failed then finally this app has been blocked by my phone so sad 
can't use it"
__label__5 great app and constantly improving appreciate the hard work by developers which made a difference however agree with other users that the ability to open the app from the widget was helpful and was taken away
__label__3 ui can be improved more rounded corners instead of hard corners it makes the app look more modern my opinion
__label__2 i used to love it it was my go to app for many years but over the time it is losing the special status it doesn't have travel time anymore which was the main reason why i could stay on top of things without mentally having to calculate each meeting and setting the times they removed that
__label__3 it delivers what it promises
__label__4 it's great bud it doesn't have task category or labales
__label__4 great habit tracking tool the widget on the home screen is a great size so i can see quickly how well i'm doing and the options at set up are thorough i'm tracking all sorts of things and it's easy to see how i'm doing highly recommended only concern is i'm having trouble getting a response on a _potential_ issue i have not sure it's real yet but if it is i'm concerned otherwise five stars
__label__2 seems like a good tool but almost nothing that i actually need to do with it is possible without a subscription i'd happily puchase the app or do a free trial period but honestly it annoys me when companies offer a free download only to put everything useful behind a paywall especially when they try to give a discount for a year's sub before you even really get to try the features nope
__label__5 i've been using this as a replacement for the default calendar for years i love it very full featured
__label__1 the idea is great and i would have loved this however i will not pay to be able to use different routines for different days this app is nothing more than a way for them to trap you into payment don't bother with this one
__label__3 needs to have feature where you add the next item to the top of the list not the bottom widget version
__label__2 its the best callendar ive used but letely its been freezing a lot and its annoying because i use it a lot pls fix the freezing edit 6months have passed and this is still freezing why i use my calendar a lot so i cant keep using this
__label__3 it's not a bad app but i find it too cumbersome to navigate i would have liked a simpler display of tasks visually and organizationally it needs work
__label__3 it's nice app but notifications don't popup on my wear os watch i can see them in notification shade but watch doesn't vibrate and there is no notification pop up on screen
__label__3 honestly this app is not user friendly is not intuitive when i try to schedule a repeating task it's confusing after selecting a task to be repeated i am asked how many days what the heck does that mean how the heck can i simply set a task to be repeated every day developers where's the user guide
__label__4 very easy to use have all i need
__label__4 for god sake change the default color this red is burning my eyes
__label__3 ok for free but limited there are better free apps i want to add details to my diy jobs such as prices links etc i want to easily share and i don't want the task to close every time i talk it trying to interact with it maybe just me but limited and a little frustrating but it's free so how can i complain
__label__5 great concept
__label__3 nice material design is to very old sound tons of todo managers with beautiful ux and interesting ux since 2015 not namy changes new releases is almost empty feels like this product develop single developer i whanta a customizible icons for every project rich graphics with analytics not single karma more actions or favorite projects in long press shortcuts manual sorting favorite projects more functions when i types a text more performance limit in 300 tasks per proje its nothing
__label__3 please add data synchronisation with google drive so when we change device we can get our old data on signing in
__label__2 the app looks interesting but it didn't work in my device which is a samsung galaxy note9 i couldn't see the introduction and i couldn't see my character in the character creation window it kept saying path profile file is needed i don't know how to fix it
__label__5 this app has helped me get back in track i started out reading my bible every three days and ended reading it every single day if you are struggling with a bad habit this is the app for you i have tried many different habit trackers before but this has been the best thus far it shows you your progress percentages too which is a really cool feature highly recommended
__label__3 even though i love it whenever i am doing tasks i like to do i cant play the atmosphere binaural app or the spotify app and i always play music when i do tasks and also i i would like naming the task feature as a way to track it another suggestion would be if i do more than i expected time wise going over to get more water for the extra time
__label__5 love this app would love to have the ability to have a desktop version that sync'd with my phone maybe add this ability to permium users overall very pleased with this app keeps a busy schduled organized especially where multiple calendars are involved
__label__4 it is such a great app to help you manage your time i really like the fact that it can set the reminder time in a very specific way it is perfect for people who have a different schedule everyday one thing to point out will be the choice of the habit although you can type it yourself wont really affect anything i would like to have more type of habit to choose except for clicking other also it is sad that you need to pay for back up but it is understandable
__label__5 love this exactly what i was looking for however would be great if there is a web app or app on mac
__label__4 i live this calendar app but i wish it was a widget
__label__1 very bad
__label__3 i personally would like to add to this app if i had a chance is change how the entires were set up you had to make up the name but it would make it better if it had a date and name to me it feels like something you can do on a piece of paper add more cool features that you can't find anywhere else
__label__2 genuinely not a good app
__label__2 i love this app but since the last update i can't use it properly it doesn't respond and has lags please solve this problem within the next update
__label__1 every basic and simple feature is premium
__label__5 hope there'll be a tab for events
__label__3 the app is easy to use but lacks the ability to list a task into multiple groups categorize to move an existing task into a group category and to group by categories in daily to do lists the category issue is a big deficit it's hard to plan without it the flexibility with categories is what makes outlook so outstanding such a shame not to find it it's sister app
__label__4 good app for management
__label__4 excellent job i don't give you 5 because i don't wanna see the panel on status bar when i already completed my tasks it's very annoying to me if you will resolve this problem then i will give you 5 insha allah
__label__4 i cannot pin unpin rewards after ui updated plz fix it i love this game
__label__5 amazing app
__label__3 edit uninstalled it takes too much interest honestly i find it not working offline a major issue i liked it but it is too slow and laggy not to mention the various bugs in game just today i was trying to add a new tag i entered it about 5 times before i gave up and them 15 minutes later i find the tag i entered repeated 3 times so i try to remove the other two also trying to organise the tasks' order the keep going back to their original order sometimes when i finish a task and check it it doesn't work and in the habits it stops working some times and other times it checks the habit twice positive or twice negative
__label__3 it is a good application it is very useful it is just okay
__label__3 i would buy if there was one time only purchase i can't pay monthly and it's still enough to use without premium but i want premium and one time purchase
__label__2 used to be a great app but i've moved phones but the sync did not work and all tracking data has been lost even after having paid 18 for premium very much a shame
__label__3 the app is great i wanted to use this app as a way to help me to creat a better habit and staying on track with certain things for me the notifications don't work unles i open the app and by that point its like my reminders have passed other then that easy app to use and navigate
__label__3 love this app its helped me with my motivation and procrastinating i've been more motivated since using it but i'm having a very frustrating issue that is driving my ocd insane i try to move a task in my list only for it to disappear or move itself somewhere i didn't tell it to go i try to keep my list in a certain order of how i should get things done and this is not helping me at all
__label__1 i was really excited about this app but when i went to create an account it did not work i tried logging in with my google account but it still didn't work i am very disappointed
__label__2 very nice and interesting concept but completely useless because you flipping need wifi to update your checklist furthermore even if my parents didn't control my wifi and i had full access there should be a way to see all your tasks etc at a glance without having to scroll so much also what's the point if you can just go in the settings and set the amount of money you want and a bunch of my friends joined habitica only to leave because it takes up too much time and it's not fun enough
__label__1 i was facing a problem that my reminder never pop out at notification bar when it's time i have send a few message to support team regarding this problem but no one reply just a member who call david he sent me a welcome message then i replied him with my problem as well he did not reply too i have just paid for 1 year package now i hope i can get my refund
__label__3 beautiful idea bad design
__label__1 i am specifically looking for a gamified productivity app my review of yours which is very lacking dark theme is missing this one appears to be for 5 year olds can you make a non child app similar to this but for regular people not 5 year old rpg gamers i avoided yours for a long time but still nothing exists yet for adults i hate rpg cause i'm not an anti social loser but want to gamify my productivity with public leaderboards in an app thanks looks well made but i don't want it
__label__5 this is the very best app i've ever used if you are a lists person any do is a must have so easy to use tons of feature but as simple as you need it to be
__label__2 no google tasks integration
__label__3 hard to use edit after your polite replay i edited my review from one star to 3 stars still find it hard to use good app don't require to read a manual to use it it should be user friendly and clear thanks any way
__label__1 can't log in the password input is shorter on the in app login than both the reset password field as well as the login form on web so my correct password is rejected
__label__2 i have been using the fully unlocked version of this application for over a year this is a fantastic app however it lacks the capability to sync with outlook calendars for example if i have subscribed to my work outlook calendar in google calendar the events will not be synchronized with sectograph this would be fine if this was the documented behavior of this application however subscribed outlook calendars are selectable from the calendar selection menu
__label__3 i like this app but this is the buggiest app i ever had i been using this for years and still havent fix them
__label__2 app is good but the programmer feature is bad i have created multiple small routines which i want to enable from programmer based on my work meetings for different days so if i have late meetings on wed and fri i want to enable a separate set of routines for these days similarly for weekends the programmer is allowing for just dates which is not the feature that i bought the pro version for i want small reusable routines that i can configure from programmer for days not periods of dates
__label__3 super app with horrible widget you can mistakenly complete a task by clicking on widget and it's gone without you even noticing it free apps have better widget honestly
__label__5 great app for visualizing your schedule and the inbetween duration of events actual time of events and time left really loved it and i treated myself with the pro version for colour customisation and 24 hour display great app
__label__4 purely task management not google keep competitor i'd switch today if i was able to create quick notes as well onenote is too rich in features and has too heavy of a ui navigation to be a valid alternative it's not stepping on onenote's if it were to have this added
__label__1 not user friendly
__label__5 helps remind me of my goal
__label__5 wonderful app to keep you up to date and to remind you to complete your tasks in time
__label__4 it's simply the best for time allocation to activities and routines
__label__1 very sad story of being wunderlist ancestor missing drag and drop missing ux at all missing ease of using creating of new task requires your full attention for several painful seconds app that was meant to make your life easy is now just some list that force me to write my tasks on paper again after few years of using wunderlist because paper has much better ux than this one
__label__1 best free calendar is now unacceptable with full audio full screen video ads the price to avoid the ad mugging is ridiculously too much uninstalled and looking for another
__label__5 gud app
__label__1 dont loggin with google its pain to delete the acconunt look at ticktick instead
__label__3 good but needs a widget
__label__3 i wanted to ask if we receive any coins if we plant trees for a long period of time because when i planted a tree for 2 hours i didn't receive any coins is this intentional or a bug
__label__2 the app doesn't really look like the screenshots it's also quite outdated in design if you don't mind paying for it then it gets the job done
__label__3 please help the app keeps crashing after some automatic update it refuses to open after the crash have to reinstall it everytime until it crashes again have done this the 6th time being a pro user i get to sign in and retrieve the data but still loses lot of time and momentum doing all this installing and reinstalling thing after each crash btw amazing app helped me focus and have goals in life
__label__1 if this was free yeah i'd totally use this who honestly wants to pay to keep track of your life wth
__label__2 i cannot log into the application somehow please help me
__label__3 hodtf coder jbikhkhkm kvukb
__label__5 excellent very visual tool
__label__5 super helpful app it help me in my study
__label__2 stupid app
__label__5 just retired and struggled with getting a routine i like to keep the same tasks on my morning routine and my evening routine check them off then uncheck later for the next day i made a to do task for things that are not the norm i really like this its a help and keeps me from chasing squirrels
__label__3 i really like any do and having my to do list and events in the same place however i have knocked off stars because i need more customisable repeat options and notifications sometimes my tasks are every two weeks or every other day or every 3 days would be nice for this option i also like to put reminders in for my work calendar i don't seem to get the option to change this when doing a new event reminder can't afford premium shame back to google calendar
__label__3 sometimes gets dates wrong e g religious holidays not as intuitive as others ok for basic use
__label__3 great app i really wish it had a break or timeout button for when i need to check a message or whatnot instead of making me kill the tree but overall great app
__label__3 i love love love the app and ever since i bought the pro version i've had it running in the background and was still able to access other apps i use for studying the problem is i can't access the store where you can buy various different trees so all i'm stuck with are the defaults and the wisteria tree i redeemed five stars if you can fix this problem
__label__1 the most complicated routine managing app ever stay away from this one
__label__5 works exactly as intended being able to separate tasks into categories and subtasks is especially useful
__label__2 i downloaded it but don't know how to use it really messed up app
__label__2 deleted review accidentally 1 i create habit type tasks the ones that repeat regularly i don't even dream to have a habit statistical section but there has to be a way to skip or fail the repeatable task now i only can delete it but is is not representative way 2 there has to be a way to exclude a list from the all tasks list for example i have list with books to read and films to watch a lot of tasks that look bad in the all tasks list i loose real important no date tasks because of it you redirect me to your uservoice but according to it excluding list from all tasks list has been in roadmap for 2 years don't think you really care and your uservoice makes any difference i know that adding habit tracker might be a heavy feature but failing the task or skipping it hell no as well as excluding lists feature it's also an easy one but two years meh just don't pretend you care be straightforward like 'we won't do it in the nearest future not in our plans'
__label__4 likes free the possibility of arranging the tasks list in my own order with a simple clic ans scroll and having it in that order as home screen widget the possibility of having the events list widget just next to the tasks list widget the events list also show the tasks and this seemingly appears like the rare feature of an events list and tasks list integrated on one screen dislikes but it would be better if the tasks kept my prioritisation order even when they appear in the events list
__label__5 user friendly
__label__3 a intenção é boa mas a interface é bastante confusa the intention is good but the interface is too confusing
__label__2 i really like the app online portal but having everything in one does me no good w o push notifications i wish this had a widget so i didn't have to open the app to look at everything i paid for this i don't feel like i got my investment back as i maybe use the app once in a blue moon it looks great but it just doesn't work to what i feel is it's full protein i hope you add this don't make me pay for it
__label__1 waste of time
__label__1 ganky couldn't get it to work right
__label__5 great app does exactly what i needed and wanted simple to use
__label__4 good
__label__3 hi long time ticktick user unfortunately the app still has big issues with subscribed local calendars recurring events from the local calendar are doubled in the list view and have been for a long time now the last time it worked properly was in 5 2 1 i notified you guys a long time ago but it hasn't been fixed i finally tried any do and it works properly with my local calendar so it seems that i will be giving them my subscription money this year
__label__3 difficult to figure out how to indent or provide a sublist
__label__3 why i gotta sync
__label__4 works as expected but i would like for time customisation to be more flexible and precise
__label__5 great
__label__5 great app keeps statistics of your day month and year in a compact form
__label__3 been using todoist for some months now great app but need to make the google home experience better it would be great if it would ask to set a time and date and would i like to change the title of the context when it asked if you would like to change the context add a label and move to a different project
__label__4 so far so good
__label__2 routines don't last forever any more
__label__3 this tool so cool for todo list
__label__3 ok i guess
__label__1 delete
__label__2 2 stars right now because all my appointments are gone before 2018
__label__4 pretty good and getting better with feedback my favourite part is the integrated calendar rather than relying on third party calendar
__label__4 almost there this app is the almost perfect solution for my job i suggest for subtasks to have their own text formatting and check lists additionally the summary page is cluttered if i could turn off task descriptions within the summary but still keep subtasks i could better understand my weekly summaries lastly i want to mark sub tasks as not complete if i know i didn't complete a task but i don't want it showing up as overdue summary formatting for this would remain the same
__label__5 this is such a fun way for chores to be rewarded my household is full of gamers and this is a great way to create and maintain habits as well as track chores on a daily weekly or monthly basis they are great about getting back to users they have real conversations and listen to user feedback
__label__4 this is by far my favorite habit tracking app and i've tried many i like the weekly view i have an unusual use for this app i use it to track my kids' school work and i like the weekly view so i can see what they have completed during the week however i'm not sure if this app is still being supported the last update was over a year ago and they do not respond to inquiries but the app does still work well
__label__4 now realize will not show appointments over 12 hours out however would think should see them in overall list but not on widget good but could be just tad better
__label__3 very redundant
__label__3 i was using journal but can't write much until my hand gets better so i was looking for the app to plan my day preciously by time thought time line of this app would work like all the icon and pre made taps but disappointed that i can not use those icons by itself for my event unless you creat another routine if dev's can modify the app that makes all those taps can be added to timeline by itself with my own time not only as events or routine that would be perfect thanks
__label__3 but then it started locking up everytime i tried to load it ved it until then
__label__2 new lay out is awful and takes extra steps to do everything that was once easy app no longer syncs to my computer app which has syncing problems of own since the last update it's slow on either set up and honestly no longer as good which is upsetting as i paid for the full year right before the update that screwed it all up i really hope you guys are working to fix the lag the lay out and the syncing problem this last update was a terrible idea
__label__5 it helps me
__label__3 suddenly stopped giving audio reminders tried everything including re installing and turning on all notifications uninstalled
__label__2 the app struggles to sort by due date i think it is at least in part due to the imported tasks from wunderlist
__label__2 useless without pro
__label__4 excellent idea great for visual based learners
__label__4 really good at what it does but i've asked for support for what seem to be glitches transferring data between devices twice and gotten nothing back that's frustrating
__label__4 amazing app some glitchy moments but overall nothing too annoying this app is so cool that i'm ok with some glitches because in a very short time its already brought so much value to my life brilliant idea to get you into good habits and out of bad ones in my experience it actually works
__label__1 guess i can't use this app after paying for premium
__label__3 i think its a nice app a nice initiative
__label__1 good app but no updates even after sending few suggestions what is the point in buying paid version
__label__4 i love it
__label__1 don't bother installing this app the free version is garbage recently the developer made the decision for inclusion of ads the ads pop up every time you add an event to the calendar the developer has chosen to sacrifice usability of the app and consumer comfort in the rush to monetise the app i have uninstalled it and will not be returning to the app again
__label__5 it has been six months since my purchase of pro version of this app and i am writing this review as gratitude to the developers though many of my favorite features have been added to default google calender app this one still is my default the diversity and configurability of widgets has been of particular help to me in managing my personal and professional tasks another feature that i had used extensively is feature of repeated tasks that have helped me in forming few good habits
__label__4 this app is an awesome and fun to do list i like it a lot and it helps me out with my life and tasks every day however the app crashes whenever i try to sort to dos by scheduled and it's getting a bit frustrating
__label__5 i've yet to find a better calendar
__label__5 easy to use keeping track of all my tasks and appointments
__label__3 i cannot get the widget i designed to show up on the screen i went through the faq with no success i have a galaxy s8 plus with android 7
__label__5 very effective and easy to use habit tracker
__label__1 apps been broken from the moment i download need fixing
__label__3 there are functions available that i can't find out how it works i e assign to me otherwise just what i needed
__label__3 please make the widget minimalistic customizable half transoerent like in com stuff todo what you have now it too cluncky all branded and in most cases doesn't fit homescreen aesthetically also make it possible to use different colors for sub and subsub tasks for example white grayer gray shifting from the left is not enough
__label__4 the app is really good but there shouldn't be a premium version of this app it should be free
__label__5 enables you to sandwich your productivity in double slices of focus it's definitely my go to planner
__label__5 love it
__label__1 you have to pay for the dark mode really it doesn't mattee how helpful this app could be for my life if it damages my eyes a lot more just because i can't afford to go premium and buy the amazing dark mode at least those whole 2 seconds of interacting with the app were fun
"__label__3 it's good but since we always have more than 1 thing to do we write three 
or more things to do and when we go to priorities ex c1 a4 b2 etc we 
wouldn't know which to do so we suggest you have more of those thanks"
__label__3 impressive could be better if it had its inbuilt calendar which is linked with events of google calendar it should also have to do list with with alerts a weekly planner thia will make it perfect
__label__3 it seems it is not designed for android users it is look like iphone application for me thats why i didn't give 5 stars
__label__1 the ads are a joke completely destroyed the experience maybe they haven't tried searching for calendar on the play store and noticed the hundred other options look elsewhere for calendar needs
__label__4 the widget sometimes shows my list as empty and it always need to be removed and replace to show the content of the list properly
__label__1 don't bother installing this app the free version is garbage recently the developer made the decision for inclusion of ads the ads pop up every time you add an event to the calendar the developer has chosen to sacrifice usability of the app and consumer comfort in the rush to monetise the app i have uninstalled it and will not be returning to the app again
__label__3 7t
__label__2 this is literally just another calendar app misleading calling it a planner smh it's not even a good calendar if you're hunting for a good planning app keep looking because this is definitely not it
__label__5 great app
__label__3 good
__label__4 just started using and seems interesting hope it'll help me to improve my life one issue i have is that it does not give an option to sort to do task by deadlines which is better to see which tasks are urgent and not overlooked hope there's an update to add this function
__label__2 i hated the pop up ads
__label__4 a great app overall complete and specific in terms of types of goals user interface aspects like fonts and some screens like the first create habit screen seem a little heterogeneous when compared to the rest of the app in other words they seem displaced out of vibe i suggest a review of the ui maybe making it a little less cluttery and cleaner for example the google fit prompts and font correlation it is a great work nevertheless congratulations
__label__4 supervb smart
__label__3 it technically does most of things you would want a list app to do but it seems to make them a bit tougher than other apps or charges
__label__3 added feature synchronizer connect added the note writing feature during the call added a feature synchronized with the mail
__label__4 nicely presented app efficient colourful
__label__3 cannot see events on calender only dots need prettier colors themes for women
__label__3 i wish it was easier to figure out i can't figure out how to make it look like the photos on here where the time is color blocked out
__label__5 good
__label__5 this app is amazing i've tried so many to do list apps but this is by far the best it allows you to do so many things i would definitely recommend this to anyone
__label__1 the widget and sync functions does not work on premium i get the widget error telling me to log in but i already have and even reinstalled the app nothing works developer please fix this
__label__1 nope all i ever wanted was to keep track of my stuff durring winter break and no im an eight year old and i have to enter an email please god no god save this app
__label__5 brilliant app love the widget my favourite feature is that it connects to my google calendar
__label__3 only 5 slots in free version and the reminders haven't worked so far otherwise a great idea
__label__3
__label__5 absolutely fallen in love with this app time management is my biggest struggle with adhd and the idle notifications reminding me of what i should be doing and what is coming up soon are quickly becoming essential hoping the developers will take the statistics of how much time is spent on each tag that's currently in only routines to the tag page as well for daily and weekly
__label__3 app is good to use but it's premium so not using now
__label__3 great app still testing it out so will come back with better rating from last time i used it it worked perfectly no issues second time around should be interesting
__label__3 needs internet connection and is a pain to set up simole tasks
__label__3 i've turned off every notification option i can find and i still get pop up reminders on my screen i just want a silent reminder in my notification bar can't tell you how many times a reminder has popped up during a call and i can't press the end button to hang up or accidently clicked the reminder while trying to do something else on my phone please give an option or tell me where to find it for notifications without a popup on the screen that steals focus on whatever i'm working on
__label__1 hard to use
__label__3 this used to be great app for tasks but with recent update i can no longer move each task around in widget according to importance or my day frustrating as i luv organizing each days tasks in order not in wiget anymore
__label__2 great app but isnt optimized for google pixel 3xl i cant re size the widget to match the size of the screen
__label__1 i liked this app even paid for it but uninstalled it today due to weird behavior i see two other reviews here with a similar problem the app will periodically launch itself but it's just a black screen and it creates a copy of my home screen looks the same but frozen until i hit the close button then the copy scrolls away and i can again use my phone just odd
__label__3 i input my appointments and it does not ring loud enough or pop up to let me know that i have an appt i have the paid version am i doing something wrong if my appt is at 11 00 do i have to input at 12 00 to get it to ring before 11 screwy lewy i will change my comments and rating once i get this resolved
__label__3 why can't i change a single event in a reoccurring series am i missing something it only has 'change this and future events' or 'change all events in series'
__label__3 please tell me how to undo an accidentally added habit i feel like i'm cheating when i delete and re add a whole habit because it's bugging me otherwise the app is a gem 3 stars till you fix this for me it still doesn't work i don't want to delete a task i want to unclick a habit because i've accidentally clicked positive negative and i can't undo it even if i click the other one to make it even it just registers it as a separate log
__label__1 it would be better to add a comment on what exactly the time spent for every time we turn the timer on now it crash and never open in my new samsung galaxy s10 lite uninstalling it
__label__3 average app
__label__4 i like the app have been using it for a few months now and the widgets plus reminders definitely keep me on track only drawback i've found is the inability to sync my profile always fails with 'sync failed make sure you have a working internet connection' have sent in support request but so far no response that aside the app works well and i can still use it in 'standalone' mode on my primary android phone
"__label__3 as a taxi driver i do runs for two friends at all times of the day and 
night i've downloaded loads of these things trying to find one that i can 
simply put in a job with a simple title like 'bristol airport pickup' with 
the time i want to be reminded not the time i make the first pickup and 
one that i can add notes to for phone numbers first pickup address and 
fare most importantly it must sound the notification even if mute is on at 
night and early mornings when ai am asleep every one i tried did the first 
two none did the latter two this one it does let me add notes but sadly 
does not make the notification sound when the phone is on silent which is a 
big oversight so it is of no use to me apart from runs when i am awake 
please fix tbis and i will hapily buy it please also add a feature so i 
can choose what reminder sound i want instead of it using the default 
notification sound"
__label__3 wunderlist was easy and intutive don't have to scroll through all the lists to figure out if anything is due or over due
__label__3 not quite what i need otherwise looks like a decent app
__label__4 i'm easily motivated by things like points and streaks so this app works really well for me to increase my productivity and decrease my anxiety i use rewards for breaks and find that i get unpleasant but short tasks done much more often because i can earn breaks quickly by just getting them over with i also get my long complicated multi part projects done early i gave it four stars because there are a couple of features i'd like to see but it works great as is
__label__1 wth i used wunderlist happily for oh about 7 years complete bs they make you sign in to an acct to use this i will not be forced to sign in so all my personal info is linked with all my private grocery and to do list microsoft has enough of my info and i have been less than happy with the invasion of cortana on my laptop ms help is the worst besides google so why would i want this co storing this level of my personal life in their database f no deleting this app immediately
__label__1 i never knew you could have a callender planner bug you so mutch it will definitely remind you of things and does not stop not interested at all
__label__5 the app does not allow to switch from monthly view to agenda with one touch only i have to slide the page find agenda in the list and then can switch google calendar does this only by touching the top of the page can you make this happen in the next update
__label__1 one of the worst app if someone believes in this app for sure they are going to miss that appointment
__label__3 nice app but there is a with the tasks syncing with other calendar
__label__5 i have been using this for a long time now and it's really useful for me especially when i need reminders to do certain things on a daily basis or weekly though it can get annoying when you're doing something and it pops up but overall it's an app i recommend
__label__2 this app doesn't seem to show multiple calenders for the same google account p s in my google calendar the desired calendar has got sync enabled still the issue exists p s 2 in the my calenders menu it is not even showing the second calender which i have made for the same google account
__label__4 a very good apps it helps me a lot when it comes into managing my time i love the features where i can set time by simply typing at 8pm for example good job developer
__label__3 the app was reccomended by my cbt therapy group but i do shift work and it's not friendly for those with rotating schedules great for 9 5rs who have single event tasks or those who tasks always repeat at the same tone each week or month i need my tasks to repeat on a 4 week cycle and it ended up giving me all my tasks together each week
__label__5 this app is great if you like structure in your life i love it give it a try folks
__label__3 i actually really love this app i used it to create some serious personal progress i purchased the full app but when i bought a new phone it wouldn't let me sign out of my old device and into my new device i emailed support about it crickets never heard from them if they can put together a decent support team i would give the app a 5 for sure
__label__5 especially like that there is a widget option where you can put your tasks on your home screen and be reminded of the tasks you set very dynamic app yet simple is appearance and interface helpful and not over the top
__label__5 thank you developers for creating such a marvelous app i found app history on the link you provided below and it has all records of everything this app has really changed my life i hope to see more such apps from the developers and there are no cons or bugs i have faced till now may god bless the developers for improving the lives of people i would rate 7 stars for such a extraordinary app lots of love 3
__label__2 statistical data for daily routine and check marks for completed or missed routines are expected
__label__5 awesome
__label__4 habitica is the best productivity app i've used thus far it lasted me for months the quests are the most motivating feature and i was able to take down a couple bosses solo however motivation dried up weeks into my first fetch quest because despite being extremely productive i had no chance of finding even one shard unless you're comfortable teaming up with a bunch of strangers to take on quests there becomes a point when being solo makes the quest motivation feature impossible
__label__5 very clear and easy to use app the paid version is so worth it having your daily schedule displayed on a clock is so nice for my adhd
__label__2 have been trying for over an hour to share lists to be able to assign tasks and lots of error messages show up and i still haven't been able to link checklists
__label__5 it's been helpful and very cute
__label__5 i've only used the free version and have been very pleased it's easy to add and repeat events no glitches
__label__5 hebrew language doesn't work
__label__3 the widget is not working at all this is a great app but the widget displays like if there was nothing when there is
__label__2 i can t select weekly days which days i need remainder and this drawback of app best to go with other app
__label__1 i did the free trial this planner does not have push notifications you can set up your events and appointments even make them reoccurring but artful agenda app will not remind you or notify you what good is a digital planner if it does not have push notifications if i am going to pay for an app it should at least have most of the features a free app has
__label__3 the concept is great and it's a fun way to keep track of your habits my only gripes are i wish there was a better way to see habit streaks the number is cool but if we could see it on a calendar like view i think that would be helpful you could miss a day and if streaks aren't set to reset the number remains unchanged better explanation of the colors on streaks i still don't know what they mean going to google it you can't use rogue skills because you get a blue screen
__label__2 seriously how did it get a 4 8 i can't even find an add button anywhere unless i go to the top left corner nah not for me
__label__3 dark mode should not be a paid for feature in any app otherwise this app is ok but feels pretty unintuitive
__label__5 good
__label__4 fantastic except i cant attach photos to a task a picture is worth a thousand words otherwise it's the best app for lists keeping work and home seperate ect
__label__4 using for a week now i like seeing the statistics and that the free version will track 5 habits
__label__4 good
__label__5 have you heard of that saying where did the time go well this app helps me stay on schedule with my day instead of it just disappearing with nothing accomplished love the interface and very user friendly
__label__3 i use it mainly for its widgets one thing though please fix the widgets so that the they show the current date and don't stay put on the previous day unless manually changed
__label__3 looks a lot like todoist i said look because todoist is bug free when compared to this one what a waste of time i had trying to set it up both by natural language and clicking
__label__4 i downloaded this game in the hope's that the format would help me with my procrastination and can i just say its exceeded my expectations it's so good i ended up having to change some of the pre set tasks and rewards to make it more personalized but apart from that it's great highly recommend if you like me like to procrastinate and make excuses to avoid tasks
__label__4 links to my amazon alexa and very useful i hated typing stuff in but now i can just ask alexa to add stuff to my to do and shopping lists i really like it there was nothing wrong with it before i just don't like typing much
__label__4 great for collaboration and communication especially since we cant meet face to face
__label__4 this app is great i love the idea of turning my daily life like an rpg game but i have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing so can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed been trying my hardest to do this on your app even finished reading the user guide but it still wouldn't work
__label__4 i just started but really like it so far competes directly with habitica but less of the nonsense costumes it's hard at first to sort characteristics skills and tasks you are essentially your own game dev but on paper i recently sorted out what i want to improve skills and what is stopping me characteristics tasks will follow soon after i'm really hopeful about this setup i love the design and i never do this but i might actually pay for a subscription if all goes well
__label__2 does not have a recurring task feature useless for me
__label__5 very nice application
__label__3 repeating previous posts don't bother with the free version if you cannot pay the premium it's just a shell not worth the space it requires
__label__4 it's a great app keep up the good work it has almost all features i've ever wished for in gamification but a few things were missing quite annoying for me and lead me to abandon this app for now if it helps you i could write you a comprehensive list of enhancements and features that i think could make this app better here's not enough space for that though please give a short answer of you'd like me to send you an email with the list of my thoughts
__label__5 very calming
__label__5 beyond the social part here we have the best way to take a good habit because at each bad habit you lose health same if you don't check a task daily or to do to say you did it and you do not want to lose health i don't know what happens when it comes to 0 but i do not want to test it actually i had another app for habits it didn't works like habitica do
__label__2 i ws kinda disappointed because i really loved the user interface of the app and how smooth it flows from one set up to another however i have to uninstall and install it back up several time because it will not accept the 4digit password i have set it up with i had to do it like 10 times but still like the app tho i hope that bug will be fixed sooner
__label__2 nice looking app albeit does not seem to sync with google calendar and not cross platform certainly cannot do 15 yr
__label__3 love the idea but the app is so buggy and not too user friendly at points first off i can't change my character when creating an account because nothing pops up it's just missing so i end up with a female characters i have galaxys10 and tried reinstalling app but nope seems to be just a bug also changing outfits just seems terrible to scroll through the not user friendly part the good idea is amazing i really want this app to improve so i can incorporate this into my daily life
__label__3 setting habits was not simple enough and at the same time was missing options it kept telling me to choose a number i would press next and same error
__label__4 noice
__label__3 odd that it doesnt count beginning and end of month corrctly in monthly tally
__label__5 so far i have used this app to check off things i hope to get done each day now i am making a list of short term goals to check off this will help me get them done soon and feel like i have accomplished something it will keep reminding me to get them done
__label__3 i'm new to using any do so i'm still really unfamiliar with the app i'm so far finding that the free version is quite limited i wanted to try the free version before doing the free trial for the premium to compare the differences the main point i'm unhappy with is the fact that the reminders don't make any noise so if you're not looking at your phone you never realize you're getting a reminder is there a way in the free version to put a sound to the reminders
__label__5 great app been using it for years have been using the paid version for a long time and expect to be so for the foreseeable future it has great syncing capabilities with my online calendar and all my other devices plus it allows me to share individual events to an individual or a group and the repeating events works in every situation i can think of
__label__3 i miss wunderlist don't like this app because i can't copy a tasks or project by copying to another section must write out in manually which is time consuming plus app doesn't let you cut and paste too cumbersome aloe and tedious wunderlist was 10x what this app is plus i couldn't move everything over sho lo'day tons of notes looking at evernote as a replacement
__label__4 best app for daily routine but there are some issue such as you can get lot of coins and increase your level to infinit though settings you should improve that because some one donot get motivated for doing task when you knew that you can change your level
__label__3 sorry i dont get it i have no idea why seeing my schedule on a circle is somehow better than a rectangle what am i missing
__label__3 my review might be a little skewed because i'm looking for something specific i want an app to create an hourly task today that doesn't require me to enter in a reminder for every hour in the day i don't really need a task manager because i have 3 built into other apps and i don't need a place to keep notes to be reminded about because i also have several apps that do that really i just want a flexible natural language reminder app
__label__2 reminders not working after configurations
__label__3 i purchased the pro version there was an update and now the pro version is gone i cannot seam to get it back and i have written thru the feedback link with no response the pro version purchase shows in my play folder but i cannot get the pro version loaded i uninstalled and reinstalled and still no help need to get the pro version loaded again please help
__label__3 to much time consuming and confusing features
__label__3 not sure what happened but now i have to hit the sync button every time to get my calendar to sync i've deleted the app and reinstalled and still having the same problem
__label__4 it takes time burpt good but it keeps getting out like you can't login
__label__5 this app is simple to use reliable for daily use it helped me much to do my tasks
__label__1 annoying slow clunky unresponsive repetitive
__label__3 stephen can 2 people share a task list on their respective phones
__label__3 ui can be improved more rounded corners instead of hard corners it makes the app look more modern my opinion
__label__1 it's a great app used it for over a year happily even paid for it recently had to switch phones and when i reinstalled on my new phone the sync function doesn't work without sync i've lost all my data tried emailing the developers for support but they don't reply
__label__5 great to do app that does everything you want also syncs perfectly with planner for elementary os
__label__3 gets me moving when i get a reminder
__label__1 i should be able to use the app when offline and the app should sync the changes whenever connected to the internet it shouldn't force me to connect with the internet for ticking a checkbox
__label__5 this is the app i never knew i needed i got the free version because it sparked my interest and upgraded to the full paid version within a day maybe i'm wired to see my day in the way they present it or maybe sectograph is wired to appeal to me i'm not sure either way their widget is the top half of my home screen and i am more in touch with my schedule than i ever have been
__label__1 not able to add people to my lists as they were on wunderlist have invited multiple times and after they click on the share link nothing happens lists not updating why did you mess with it
__label__1 the app started crashing recently whenever i try to use it i press a button and it freezes completely and stops responding i tried uninstalling and re installing at first it went okay for 2 days the the same thing happened again it frustrated me i'm not sure if i'm the only user facing this problem but i sure hope it gets fixed
__label__1 looking at the features and lots of accolades i tried uninstalled after just a trial reason in the free version notification feature is missing if the task misses the set time there is no notification we will come to know only if we open the app insanely ridiculous not sure what have the product team thought while excluding such a basic feature
__label__4 though i would love to see it make improvements
__label__5 good app i use it to daily to keep track of everything it works well
__label__5 great apps for maintain schedule
__label__4 i like the simple interface and it helps me set reminders for tasks schedule them and analyse them
__label__4 good app effective at reminders easy to use and read looked at quite a few task apps happy i picked this
__label__5 i have never seen any other tasks or to do list that has so many options functions available i am really impressed and appreciate this app
__label__2 please help relogging in after several months disuse it has asked me to enter a username and it's stuck on 'username taken' will not let me progress to the app i've tried every random letter number combination so it's definitely not taken just buggy app
__label__3 hodtf coder jbikhkhkm kvukb
__label__5 great love this app you can organise your timetable and clone events you can have a weekly cycle daily cycle or a odd day cycle love this great aesthetics as well
__label__3 good idea and work i would like to give it 5 stars if you solve my problem im using asus zenfone 3 max and app not able to detect my usage of other apps and plant never withers even if i close the app i give every permission it demands but it still continues im pro version user by the way
__label__2 the latest update is poorly designed for users with lots of tasks completely changes the old interface with attending bugs out of the blue biggest fan to dead in the water overnight shocker
__label__2 it's clear to me that this is the best todo app and i've used it for a long time but having reminders be a premium feature is just unreasonable as it's impossible to use a todo app without them i'll be switching to ticktick
__label__4 i liked it i just have to many things i want to put in it and i can't afford to pay for premium
__label__3 this is my first time rating this app because i noticed that there were changes in putting a reminder hopefully after the task tab the time date will be under it it's a bit hassle that it was made smaller that without my glasses i didn't notice it for several times also i don't see any purpose of sharing it to other people so it should not be the priority i hope that you can do something about this anyway thank you for helping me get through my daily tasks i'll wait for another update
__label__4 amazing app for students
__label__3 the app is pretty good and has good features however when i shared a grocery list with my fiance it wouldn't let him accept and it it sent him tons of emails regarding it literally 1 every few minutes for hours and i have no clue how to stop this without him just unsubscribing given that sharing is a big part of why i wanted the app it does put a damper on things for me
__label__3 when i tap the plant button it does not shows the timer page and seems not to start
__label__3 everything good simple and easy to use the best one but you dont get reminder as alarm so that you can actually know the schedule its just give a notification which can be easily ignored by mistake please fix this and link it up with alarm too just like you did with default calendar app
__label__3 microsoft forces you to use your microsoft account to use it then never keeps you logged in long enough to get notifications sharing via text feels like i'm back on my droid phone and trying to get updates to shared lists suffers from the forced log outs as well also can't customize smart lists that are stuck at the top my day and tasks that's the same thing for me either let me put it at the bottom or let me remove them microsoft took wunderlist and ruined it
__label__5 very good app and it's very calming really helps me learn how to let go and spend less time on my phone
__label__1 deducted my money for no reason i used the service once and then never used it return my money immediately
__label__4 i can't sign in neither with my google account nor with gmail should i do something to be able to do that or it's just a bug
__label__2 not a fan liked the idea of diving into main areas and percentage of your day it occupates but what flipped me up was scheduling a reminder daily i started getting a morning reminder of the task for the next day schedule for i e 7pm i mean what about task i have for this day ahead i don't need to be notified 27hrs ahead of my daily rutine seriously
__label__1 disappointed cant plan the same task over multiple days manually adding same task to repeat each day is a downside uninstalled
"__label__3 to dos should be named to quest don't feel like im playing a game with a 
boring to do list its very depressing now a quest i think it fits 
better the description also why does this app doesn't have any financial 
options to help me keep track of bills debt"
__label__1 this app is super best
__label__4 will there ever be an update with an easier way to sync with other devices i have spent so much time trying out todo apps with reminders and this is probably the best one ever but i would really want to be able to manage it all across more than one device such as with an autimatic periodic upload or one touch sync button like in colornote thanks
__label__3 i liked it nice features but not giving the colour changing option premium only is just cheap i wish i can set my own music for my reminders
__label__3 i like this app but i give only 3 stars because i am unable to bye new plants whenever i go to store to bye new plants it always load loading never stops and so i was always unsuccessful to bye new plants please make any solution for this problem so then i can give you 5 stars
__label__1 real hassle to set up with synchronization with others i cannot work out what the small red number on the icon relates to and cannot get rid of it with wunderlist it related to completed tasks and once these were viewed the number disappeared i much preferred wunderlist which worked fine why won't microsoft leave well alone i do not need this app to run my life just keep lists which can be mine or shared
__label__4 awesome app i love it simple and great reminder systems one big thing is missing though family calender shared calender with family members incisive kids without the app phone e mail and option to organise event and tasks for other familymembers
__label__2 the app slider for the font from normal to large is not working it is only giving two options normal and large the slider doesn't slide across and let you set your own font size
__label__1 new update has performance bug very slow in scrolling down and typing update after last update now i cannot type or write anything in task description after markdown features
__label__3 requests ability to change task into subtask by drag and drop option for default list of all lists option for organizing list order in all lists view
__label__4 long time user across 4 locations
__label__1 hard to use
"__label__3 nice app i wrote the developer and was able to get a prompt response 
unfortunately for me the backup and restore process did not work at all 
and i will be unable to actually use it i may look for another update and 
try at a later time but for now this just is not smooth enough between 
different devices for me"
__label__4 helped me a lot
__label__4 so far it has worked ok for me
__label__4 im enjoying it so far
__label__1 the reason i am giving this 1 star is because of its unreliability i purchased this app for my android phone and my mac desktop it is very frustrating that the same app on my mac is not updating with my phone this app is absolutely useless to me when i cannot see events that i have put in in real time even after i refreshing the app very disappointing and kinda pissed off that i paid good money for this app
__label__5 well i downloaded it liked it and bought it it didnt disappoint me after a long time of usage the one and only app i have bought and probably ever will buy thank you
__label__4 have been quite satisfied with premium for a year would have been so good with a monthly weekly calendar view for my ticktick tasks like the web app has no calendar icon although the doc vaguely states that there is guess it has been removed well it still has a tiny edge to the competition
__label__2 unable to import any data from the csv file in cloud no option to get any data back bought premium and im not happy beware
__label__5 first app in ages i paid premium for it's actually has made me more productive and is great for balancing life work and study
__label__5 after trying a few other apps i decided to us this one the things that attracted me were very easy to use and have all the features i needed
__label__2 cannot enter how long a task will take which severely limits its use for scheduling
__label__3 widget is not working in nova launcher
__label__4 it's a great start to improving your life but it's more or less just a planner app
__label__3 a bit disappointed bought a new phone and re download ed the app would not bring my calander in from my old phone and asking me to repay for the full version
__label__2 the moderation of the discussion bards in the app leaves something to be desired needs better moderation
__label__1 i dont understand anything
__label__3 on the phone it works perfectly but now that i've installed the app on the tablet i realise that it doesn't have the option to rotate the screen if the tablet is rotated please add this feature so that i can see better the tasks
__label__3 i like that this app notifies you for tasks but it should respect android system's do not disturb i shouldn't be reminded when i sleeping and i explicitly turn off notifications no other app i have notifies me in do not disturb mode
__label__1 cash grab and nothing more purchased the app a year ago but now due to an issue on the account being asked to pay for it again very disappointed and no response from seller last update was 1 year ago so as far as i am concerned the developer abondoned it
__label__2 it was good but i guess google is sabotaging it so i lost a couple of notifications removed it and started using google calendar and notifications are now ok sorry i have uninstalled the program since i missed an important appointment i can no longer trust it probably the solution you provide works but i think it you should force the user to check those settings on start so one doesn't miss appointments
__label__4 hey great app though recently i have started to experience an issue the app is continuously asking me to refresh the background task and as a result it's not consistently showing notification if i forget to do so
__label__3 i suddenly can't login on my account and can't sync lists suddenly it became so useless
__label__1 no notification or stick to notification n alert n all features not working after a day in my previous review you replied to try that feature i already did that my android version is 9 asus zenfone max pro m1 plz fix this error
__label__1 app install page says nothing about it being a free trial for 2 weeks so you have to pay to use this app this is not disclosed on the app page from which you initiate install
__label__1 cant see my character
__label__3 сильно не хватает возможности поделиться списком например покупок с семей
__label__1 will not accept passcode after today's update have been a paid user for some time and need my info back please fix and i will update my review useless to me until resolved
__label__1 it wouldnt sync to my google calendar i had it set up and everything
__label__3 no reminder tone else 5 star
__label__4 i really love this app it makes me more motivated in doing my tasks but the only problem is after a week while using this app the pop up message connection error began showing up on my screen i'm connected in our wifi and it's fast enough if it's just because the app is under maintenance i would appreciate if you will put a message regarding on that like under maintenance go back for an hour it's working now v
__label__5 absolutely replaced wunderlist for me devs are responsive to suggestions with one or two extra features richer data for pomodoros a handful of 3rd party integrations to handle automated tasks ticktick could replace several other apps i use too love it
__label__3 great app but it keeps deleting the events birthdays etc that i put in it i've never had this problem before please do something this is my go to calendar app and i'd hate to have to find a different one
__label__5 it's very very helpful and simple to use i use it daily to list n maintain by task list or reminders
__label__4 so far so good i will rate better once i start realy utilizing the app thanks
__label__1 when i set to remind me daily it shows even in past and it doesn't remind me kindly let me know the way to set it proper
__label__3 hi i can't see my avatar and related things
__label__2 doesn't sync to my smartwatch
__label__2 have difficulty syncing to google calendar
__label__5 okay decided to write the review because this app is just amazing it's simple and functional i love the fact how easily you can create tasks set time etc the only thing i'd like an option to set up default settings like always have an alarm automatically on for the tasks i create i can finally delete all other task reminded apps found my perfect solution love it
__label__1 micro transaction i wish i could give 0 stars
__label__4 i use free version and its useful for everyday tasks 4 stars because there are too many ads
__label__5 excellent super app gift my god thankyou
__label__4 very helpful for getting things done i wish there were more white noise options but otherwise very cool
__label__3 please fix the date format we're not all backward americans
__label__4 quite a good app for me
__label__3 it doesn't reset or set you reminders but it helps
__label__1 i bought the premium version of this app and it doesn't work the reminder does not function which basically renders the app useless i emailed the support team and i haven't gotten any response or acknowledgement of receipt i want a refund what a waste of my money
__label__4 great app very usable and straightforward but i wish the calendar view showed the days you had completed all of your goals for that day seeing your progress streak would be very encouraging
__label__4 thank you for the prompt response i've been using any do for years and will be continuing to do so i like some features available with the premium option but i'm not a subscription person still i haven't seen any app to beat any do
__label__5 an option for smaller text would be realllly nice and distinguished it's so big and bulky looking and only fits a couple habits per page fun and actually works it doesn't have a history for or even track your habits tho but still best app ever
__label__3 troublesome widget organization when i tap a date it opens app to date previously open not new date needed very time consuming and creates booking mistakes when not careful
__label__3 there's some problem with the newest version the app doesn't blacklist other apps anymore apart from that this is a good app provides motivation to stay focussed edit on 2019 11 17 please fix the new bugs the app is crashing everytime i'm planting a tree after installing the new update
__label__1 add the feature to quit bad habits and to track progress of tasks
__label__3 have to push too many buttons to approve my route not hands free friendly
__label__5 this is what i was looking for thanks guys
__label__3 syncing doesn't work still no reply from support
__label__3 this app used to be brilliant it then began to function regardless of whether you were using your phone or not essentially just becoming a basic timer and then now the timer fails and kills trees when youre not using your phone i just planted a tree only for it to die 20 seconds after when my phone locked
__label__3 one issue is that it doesn't adapt to the device fonts i mean the iphone font u use looks good on iphones but not with other phones pls fix this asap
__label__4 jordar
__label__5 i love artful agenda it is the beauty and organization of a paper planner with the convenience of being online and on my phone love the new featured that keep rolling out
__label__2 this is only to add your todo list and thats all tou can do with the free if you want to put date and time to let you know you have to do somthing you pay not good at all with free versions drom other apps do the same this pay app
__label__4 needs more ranks
__label__3 its honestly a great app other than the fact that it keeps pushing for me to upgrade and i cant do certain things unless i upgrade
__label__3 app is good but i want to suggest something there should be to do list type of feature that is what sort of things we are doing regularly from our routine will be selected and those which left undone will be not selected in this way more clear picture of time allotment and productivity can be seen
__label__2 wasn't sure to begin with as it's not all that user friendly but how frustrating to take a chance anyway pay for premium only to have it not sync with my calendars wasn't really any other reason to pay for premium except that what a small waste of money it's of no use to me now
__label__4 missing one key feature custom sorting of lists otherwise quite good search capability is excellent
__label__1 language of the app doesn't change at all places
__label__3 asks for a subscription to get all the features i'd pay a one time fee only guess you don't want my money bad enough edit yes i know which is why you got a negative review i like your app i don't like paying subs i raised u to 3 stars for taking this so we'll all to often devs get all butt hurt add a feature to buy a lifetime license even if it's 20 dollars and i'll buy it or give us an option to see ads without a sub at least cheers do this than 5 stars
__label__2 i was trying out the routine trick i set the times and dates but it just wouldn't work please help
__label__3 i don't like the new update it's very confusing i can't use it anymore
__label__3 nice
__label__5 very good has power user features as well like defining properties through text and stuff haven't tried the collaboration part yet
__label__3 nothing special limited options no google tasks sync and costs 2 99 mo no thanks
__label__3 authors please stop associating every extension with this app it's annoying this pops up when i try to open a jar file edit this means that excluding certain very popular file extensions svg pdf jpg when a file is opened from the files app business calendar opens this means if i try to open a bz2 file a androffice file odt or a jar file jar it's strange for me that open office files wouldn't open in androffice but instead business calendar opens instead
__label__1 how it should work is fantastic and perfect for me but whenever i have my schedule laid out and planned the app deletes them or forgets them and i have to start over only to have them deleted again i really really want to use it why does it make it so unable to
__label__4 good and helpful but the notification alarm does not snoozes automatically the notification stays on the notification bar until not removed pls keep a limit till after which it should snooze
__label__1 i have used this app for a couple of years now and it was great it had small banner ads before however recently they have incorporated video ads which play every time you input a new plan this is incredibly tedious and a massive waste of time do not download
__label__5 tried all habit tracker apps it's the best one yet just please add an option to the calendar icon so i can see all the habits tasks together at the calendar read their notes or success failure rate keep up the good work
__label__5 versital customizable alert settings
__label__4 just downloaded the app and noticed that i cant have 2 events overlapping eachother my example is to be in the office for my job and do schoolwork but i categorize these as two different events and want to be able to see them as such so i know everything i am doing please add this
__label__2 reminders doesn't work
__label__1 update dropped 5 star rating to 1star app will not sync i have it on android and ipad and neither one of them will sync to the server app store shows 8 months since any updates would not have paid for premium if i knew it wasn't going to be maintained original review i wanted to make something like this myself but they've already done a great job i feel more obligated to the daily habits i'm trying to build and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks
__label__4 it's a great concept to get work done or take a break from the phone it would be nice if there was an option to time yourself and grow a tree while doing work on the phone itself like working on google docs for instance if the app allows you to identify some work apps and use only those while the tree grows
__label__3 the creating of tasks is pretty straightforward and easy to use but i don't like the idea that tasks in filters are the same copy of tasks in lists sometimes i change my mind with which tasks and lists go to which filters and if i want to remove the filter then it deletes all the tasks within it as well i want to be able to delete the filter without having to delete the tasks themselves entirely
__label__5 i'm liking it so far it's actually motivating me a bit will update review with time
__label__5 excellent app with useful features to get stuff done thankfully not bloated with ads or useless features highly recommend
__label__1 beginning setup wasn't loading at all signed up using facebook since it was not loading i just clicked next now i'm stuck with my avatar with no way to change
__label__3 love the app love the rewards but i wish that it showed you past dates and all you accomplished on days previous and i wish that the coloring of tasks wasn't so complicated when getting close to red or blue or whatever also certain things are hard to navigate but overall i absolutely love this app use it every day not so much for challenges or battles but for habit making and to do's
__label__3 awesome until i was trying this app out to see if it was possible to finally break ties with my paper calendar this app had some features that made it better than google calendars that is until you had to watch an ad to schedule an appointment now when i save an appointment have to sit through a full page ad i didn't get enough time in the app to figure out if it was worth it to pay for the full version but now the mandatory ads are a deal breaker
__label__5 this is a good app for note and everything as you want i am so happy for using this app but it is more better if have search options so currently improve it
__label__4 it's a really great app
__label__3 nice
__label__3 nice
__label__2 does not show reminders
__label__5 really nice app sir could you please provide goal tracking functionality too that'd be very useful too
__label__4 i don't like how the due date doesn't change for the next day
__label__1 lacking calendar monthly overview to be able to perceive tasks projects also in a timely manner so that essential dimension is just missing
__label__3 be better with text slightly smaller as a simple list takes up more than a full screen
__label__3 wouldn't it be great if this app had also alerts instead of just notifications it's easy to miss a notofication also why can't we edit a specific day for a repeated event but we have to edit also all future events or nothing
__label__1 i received a notice from planner pro this morning when i went to schedule some appts it notifies me i cannot use the app until payment received ii checked my bank and payment was made on 01 26 2019 i will be cancelling as unable to use
__label__3 decent app works like intended but does have bugs for the extra game part of it constantly have to close and reopen the app because the loading bar never really loads or white screens another thing is i dont think we should be paying 3 gems to change our class i accidently chose a class when i upgraded enough and i thought i was fine as the bottom said you can change a class later except it didnt say we needed 3 gems to do it i dont usually get that many gems unless i buy them
__label__5 works great
__label__4 simple and helpful once i figured out how it works i wish it didn't cost money to work on more than 5 habits
__label__3 nice app but the price scared me
__label__1 bought the premium version long ago but now it has ad on it
__label__2 why would tasks be tabs instead of a list the whole screen is empty and you make us scroll tabs o
__label__3 very useful can't get the tasks to sync with outlook tasks though i only see local tasks would get 5 stars if this was working
__label__3 its a great app but need to add a version were you can restore your notes if lost my app got erased by accident and i dont have any of my notes saved please consider adding to the app
__label__1 was great at first but a new bug makes it so that every time i unlock my phone i have to press the home button twice to be able to use my phone at all i know that it is this app causing the problem as when i click on the recently used apps tab after the bug occurs this app is always the only one shown i will have to uninstall now because of this
__label__5 this is the best app ever i am a very procrastinative person from a long time ago so i decided to improve my life i suffered so much because i did things i didn't needed to do in the wrong time but habitica was there to help me rewarding me to use my time wisely 3 thank yooooooou ddd
__label__3 great feature is reminder to reorganize missed and undone tasks but ui of the app looks confusing to me i cat find a way to add tasks easyly enought gor me i dont know what next google tasks are simplier and todoist have limited features in free version
__label__1 i paid for this app and it was a wonderful app easy platform customisable but there has been a recent addition of ads all the time for an app i have paid for i think this is disgusting i response to you no these aren't spam events linked to my phone i uninstalled this app and used my original paid version of the called app and there are no ads i was prompted to update to this version a while ago i thought it was just an ad on from the paid version of business calendar i had
__label__2 the app doesn't sync after making changes on my google calendar even after hitting the sync now on the app
__label__2 please fix the widget annoying error whenever i press the button to add something to any particular group i set it always move only to the task even i had changed the destination to the group it's still change back to task again so i have to move everything from task to specific groups again every time really annoying
__label__2 cool concept but unusable for google business users because all of your coworkers calendars are selected by default and there's no bulk deselect all button
__label__1 i couldn't even make an account it wont work
__label__1 this app has been broken by the last update most of the times whenever i try to plant a new timer the app just hangs and i have to close it somehow also the timer in the notification panel hardly updates accordingly please fix this
__label__4 a great app for tracking goals and habits it is also the most fun since you achieve virtual goals xp and gold to level up your character will give 5 5 if it had a dark theme
__label__3 i used to love it but now every time i want to add any tasks it asks for speak text which when you're trying to discretely add a reminder is offputting fix that and you've got a great app
__label__2 i dont like that it only works with calendar i dont want a calendar even called sleep just to keep it on the graph
__label__5 simple to use and seemless sync with outlook
__label__3 the app is great for the use however i am giving it 3 stars if i make a new event and change the colors or add more than one reminder these changes erase after i create the event this results in me having to make those changes twice for them to be saved very annoying and inconvenient edit i add the events on my phone for a synced calendar the wifi connection is always stable as well
__label__3 the idea behind it its very good but it wont even let me log in
__label__4 i love the app so i decided to install it again to keep up with school work it works amazing but my screen is very dark my phone brightness is all the way up but the app isnt bright but instead very dark this has never happened before how do i fix this
__label__4 the app is really amazing it helps me plan my day ahead and it's super convenient because it plays u whatever that have been planned on the day like a recap moment thanks
__label__3 you should put in the description that the widgets monthly weekly and even daily calanders are for premium users that's the main reason why i downloaded if you don't have the money for a subscription its just a checklist which can be done on most defualt phone calander apps
__label__4 the app is real comfortable for use the only thing i can't understand is how to view the events you create from the calendar icon top left
__label__1 plz change the orange color in dark theme to blue
__label__1 so many portions of the app we're not appearing on the screen from the get go including the first two screens entirely and even the avartar selections
__label__2 paid widget feature one thing that downplays all other
__label__1 sign in problems didn't even let me use it
__label__5 super awesome
__label__4 the app is perfect but one tiny problem the reload icon is sometimes peeking out at the bottom of the list title
__label__2 cant make into my calendar
__label__5 a lot of work to make this app wonderful for good habbits building
__label__4 this app is cute and a great option to just setting a timer when working studying however several times i have gotten a wilted tree just because some other app sent me notifications when i myself did not touch my phone
__label__5 very versatile app i used this primarily as a to do list and grocery list
__label__1 does not refresh on samsung phones i have done every troubleshooting step and more to no avail
__label__1 no es intuitiva
__label__3 if only this app would allow integration with google calendar and todoist i really like the promodoro timer feature of this app and wanted to use it for my tasks in todoist although this app allows subscription to local calendar you cannot use promo timer with calendar tasks please allow integration with other apps
__label__3 it won't allow me to sync it with my android watch and there is nowhere to ask questions
__label__2 eh it's mediocre and really doesn't do anything your calendar app on your phone doesn't already do i liked using the month widget until it just decided on jan 29 that the month of february no loger existed i tried to look ahead to the month of feb to see a preview from the widget but it kept going fron jan to march the only way to view feb in the widget was to change the date to feb in my phone just went back to my phone's calendar app uninstalling
__label__3 its a good way to manage your time but after a while the timeline menu bugs out and stops sending notifications besides that the app is very good
__label__5 keeps me organised very happy with would be even better if it had functions to support dsylexia sufferes
__label__5 great task app still don't know how to integrate in to outlook on pc wunderlist had integration
__label__2 i liked the app notifications when they worked gotta pay 2 99 a month crazy mbe a year not a month for a calendar app most widget features wont work unless u pay never got to see if they even were worth 299 a month i like the popup reminders hopefully someome will make a free one
__label__3 it's a good app but i wish it would allow multiple users to see each others task list and to send task to each other
__label__5 this app does a great job of cleaning up the google calendar and making it more user friendly i use it all the time for my business
__label__4 excellent app does everything you want a habit tracking app to do only complaint is the app counts the current day in your progress with no option to change that so it looks like you are less successful than you really have been on a daily activity done near the end of each day for example if i am tracking going to the gym after work everyday and have been successful for 2 weeks the app will show me as less than 100 successful until i indicate today is successful need to fix that
__label__5 this app is awesome i love the wear os compatibility i have a couple feature requests it would be great if you could filter which calendars you can see on the greyscale mode also it would be nice to have an option in the settings for making the watch 24 hours always currently if i restart my watch it switches back to 12 hours so i have to turn on the tap to toggle feature tap my watch then turn off the tap to toggle feature since i don't want to accidentally switch it back
__label__2 i got no notification
__label__3 i would really appreciate if dev focus on improving existing features like natural dates and time rather than adding new features
__label__4 it very easy to use but we should be able to merge tasks for all accounts in one location changing account from personal to work or school is really annoying i once lost all my data when my school account became inactive
__label__5 i like the clear unclutter look everything is organized wished i could export it without having to pay extra
__label__4 great app
__label__2 please stop with the updates especially on the desktop version you're just making it worse the most recent update sucks stop at least make it so you can add all of your previous my day tasks from yesterday with one tap i'm tired of having to add each one individually
__label__4 i really love this free app it's so cool to see my schedule visually and know how much time i have until the next event the only thing i would change and this may already be available in the paid version is the ability to choose different colors for each event
__label__3 amazing app
__label__1 couldn't edit any habit in this apps can't add pages episodes and liters bec they're not available in the edit menu the only way to edit a habit is to delete it
__label__3 sorry this is not a review but a question anything i enter in google calendar ends up in any do but not the other way around how do i do this have i missed something specifically i want my goggle home mini to be able to tell me what's on my any do tasks and calendars
__label__3 looks good but doesn't have web version would be 5 stars if i was rating author's dedication functionality wise can't give more than 3 the app is inferior to any do or microsofts todo
__label__4 love it makes sures i do my task one thing to fix can you make a section where we can save our list in case we get new phones
__label__2 now i don't trust this at all i learned about the transfer just today so immediatley thought i'd swop over everything seemed fine i got a pop up to say everything had been successfully transferred then this evening i'm just adding something when i get a pop up that the transfer was incomplete so what do i do now unless i cross check everything in all the lists i have how do i know what's missing not transferred omg i seriously do not need this right now
__label__5 i'm not usually one to advertise but seriously if you are looking to be more organized with your daily weekly monthly yearly or random tasks then tick tick may be right up your alley i downloaded it about a week ago as a suggested upgrade from the gtask tracker app which i liked a lot and i absolutely love this app for real
__label__5 a good visual representation of what i do on a particular day
__label__3 it's a great app don't get me wrong but it's a kind of over complicate things with certain widgets and etc
__label__5 i really love the app i use it a lot while studying but it doesn't notify me when the time's up i installed it twice and i followed the instructions about notification access and stuff but it still doesn't work i also have the last version of the app so i don't think that's the problem what can i do update seems to work now thanks
__label__3 my calender does not sync with this app how can i get it to work it's great otherwise how do i sync all my calenders with the he app
__label__2 no subscription tank you please full price i no lack forever
__label__2 not very intuitive i couldn't find a way to switch between week day or month views
__label__5 its a very useful app
__label__3 i really miss some stuff what is available in wunderlist 1 all the tasks in different lists that is available in the general task list not only planned tasks 2 the option to show new task on top of list 3 option to move important tasks to the top 4 option to show task for the week bring that ib and you will definitly get a 5
__label__3 one with a calendar view would be helpful
__label__1 notifications only come up when you come app
__label__1 does not work
__label__1 ive been using the pro version of this app for over two years and its been great but now it doesn't alert me to events i have changed all the settings in the app and android to allow alerts and i have adjusted the battery settings to allow background activity by the app but still no alerts the alerts only work when i open the app pointless
__label__3 from the reviews this app sounds awesome unfortunately i can't use it because i need an app that syncs with google tasks
__label__3 bug confirm to delete doesn't appear after swipe to delete action but does appear during select item menu delete shouldn't it be the other way around easier to accidentally swipe or for both pls add animation to indicate syncing progress so we know when we can force quit pls add option to add tasks to top of list sorting seems random when choosing to show completed tasks shouldn't all completed tasks be stacked under non completed or is it chrono but we can't see it
__label__1 anything that calls itself a to do list that doesn't include a reminder unless you upgrade is useless uninstalled
__label__2 this app is not getting opened pls look after this
__label__5 download ing
__label__2 task notifications have stopped working
__label__3 so far so good but two improvements would allow me to delete the other planner app i have on my phone 1 reminders i am looking for an app that would act like a print planner where i would list my tasks by day for the future i'd like to be able to check an app for mon tue weds etc but without having to set a specific reminder for each monday should just be monday without needing to set a time would be great to just have a list for the whole day 2 for lists such as grocery lists i don't see any setting to allow the app to stay on screen if you are currently in a store and trying to buy off your list this is important no one wants to grocery shop and have to constantly unlock their screen to see the list
__label__4 it's a good start but i miss some of the simple capability of wunderlist
__label__5 good app for daily reminder
__label__4 almost perfect but need time setting for due dates as most students using it will require to have proper time input of their assignments cheers to the team did a great job
__label__2 95 of our features are free this is not true almost every feature i try to use takes me to the premium option just started trying this app even setting the color to the task is not free
__label__1 not work in my tab lenovo yoga 3 bed experience
__label__3 good but expensive
__label__2 i was shocked to discover that notifications is a paid feature i uninstalled would have been great otherwise
__label__5 the app has a clean sharp interface and is easy to use i appreciate having one app for my daily todo's and calendar needs it also never unexpectedly quits on me
__label__3 if you delete the app or transfer phones you will lose everything all past progress is gone and you can not get it back you also can never use that login info again just keep that in mind also if you set your habit goal for example twice a week you'll still get reminders everyday no options to change it to only notify when goal needs to be completed
__label__2 fundamental problem in their development cycle force users to update but the value to the consumer doesn't have a feedback mechanism prior to forcing the update is there not a beta program with participating users todoist that's what you need to fix for everyone else my widgets have lost their usefulness and are now just place holders until i can remove the complete buttons shrink text have fully customizable widgets or settle on another app but really focus on the root problem
__label__4 love the look of this agenda list feature is great way to track complete to do lists
__label__2 cool idea but it keeps crashing when you try to add subtasks
__label__3 by how clean sleek it is only efficient and pretty planner out there but the task widget doesnt update at all
__label__2 you have to buy pro version
__label__4 everyone would be more productive if tasks had multiple notifications aside from the due date notification hopefully you'll introduce it in the next update thanks
__label__5 this has really helped me be motivated to get things done im really enjoying this app
__label__4 eu daria 5 se estivesse totalmente traduzido para português
__label__3 this is unforgivably close to perfect why no timer so many tasks are long term and need to be chipped away at bit by bit you could have it where once a task was selected the timer would start and you would earn a certain amount of experience and coin for every x amount of minutes completed as it is i have two pair this app with a different promodo app
__label__1 the english used is very poor thus if the developed cannot master simple rules of grammar why should i trust them with such sensitive subject matter uninstalled
__label__1 this app would be great if they would just stop locking people out of premium this has happened with several users for months and still not fixed i got a new phone and can't use this app because login with facebook won't transfer this is my first one star review i ever gave an app and to say i am disappointed just use one of the many other habit trackers
__label__4 good app just wish you were able to back date a completed task so i can use it for tracking habits as well but it's a to do list app and works well
"__label__3 i really do like this but there's one probably petty reason i have given 
it a three my class i cannot seem to change from warrior to something 
else this is a problem to me because i personally hate the warrior class 
in games this makes me less motivated to stop my warrior from losing 
health and the such i would be much more motivated to help my healer"
__label__3 great app and so far no issues using it
__label__3 this one is very beautiful but its tree texture is not beautiful
__label__3 i don't like to put on google calendar every schedule
__label__5 great to track simple stuff i track exercise and days i stick to my diet it is helping to keep me honest without much effort
__label__3 i had to pay for the option to change the colours then i had to pay more to customise it further exploitative money grabbing like this ensures i'll never recommend it to anyone else works well though
__label__4 very nwice hi how can i sort my todos according to due date is there any way i can team up with local players also is any offline version coming up just to check off tasks thanks
__label__2 hi there i would like to know if this application is for free or do i need to pay for it thank you for your answer
__label__4 great so far it would be nice to allow the 5 buttons on the widget have an option to skip a day week or month forward or backward if i would like to look ahead i have to open one or two apps when it could be a button you set on the widget maybe even a button option that allows one widget to switch between multiple calendars just thought id include that suggestion
__label__2 interesting idea but useless
__label__3 overall decent experience main areas i'm not happy with are ui design choices lots of wasted space and navigational steps that could be improved wish i could see the content in more compressed format also no night dark theme which is important to me when using an app i night pull up before going to sleep or in early morning
__label__1 faltu required money for everthing even for sign up don't install waste of time
__label__4 i liked it i just have to many things i want to put in it and i can't afford to pay for premium
__label__3 the app is good but reminders don't seem to be working
__label__3 not able to see flagged emails which are overdue or which are due after tomorrow it would be great if we are able to see all the flagged emails at one place
__label__5 does what you need it to do i like that you can take notes and the little encouraging reminders are helpful
__label__3 good
__label__4 i'm liking it so far it's a very customizable experience and i can really get into the details without the interface being too complex i would like to see more widget options for the ap on the home screen i like to see my schedule and routine the moment i open my phone while there is a widget it's rather lack luster synced with the programming i think it would be cool if they had a calendar widget available
__label__2 loved this app but recently noticed i really was't hearing the audio from notifications and for some unknown reason although the notification volume for the pro version sounds loud at 100 system volume for notifications this version bc2 sounds half as loud if that to the point it's unusable because i rarely hear them update just realized that for some odd reason bc2 calendar notification volume is mapped linked to ringtone volume and i had that lower than half volume please fix this
__label__4 i've been using this app and the watch face on my moto 360 for close to about a year now with all my events for the day and the next day visible on my wrist i can keep track of my calendar easily however recently the watch face is defaulting to 'simple clock' default watch face whenever i use the watch it only affects sectograph and it has been bugging me since
"__label__3 2 things would persuade me to make this my task list automatic synching 
via google drive and an ike like view a 2 by 2 table showing urgent vs 
important tasks it's good to be able to categorise tasks into lists but 
equally necessary to know where you need to spend your time google 
 eisenhower matrix for ideas would also love to see a chrome app for 
desktop use"
__label__5 exactly what i have been looking for love it
__label__3 good would like for completed tasks to automatically move to the bottom
__label__2 too complicated i spent a half hour looking at the guide trying to figure it out created new characteristics and tasks but on the home page there's no drop down to choose a task when i saw i'd have to create one every time i decided to uninstall suggestion create tutorial no one has time for the long guide if we did we wouldn't need a productivity app
__label__3 seemed like a decent enough app but i was looking for a calendar that worked with google but that i could add local photos to events with a feature currently lacking in google calendar without that didn't seem different enough to justify extra install
__label__5 such a cool app exactly what i was looking for and so easy to use
__label__2 i was willing to give this a try to see if it suits my needs seemed ok with limited use so far the only thing more annoying than constant notifications from apps is at 9am when my phone vibrates and any do takes over the whole screen and asks me to plan my day i don't need it taking over things i will plan when i want are you seriously doing this it is the equivalent of a browser popup and very annoying
__label__3 good but not fully free
__label__1 waste of time
__label__4 you can add one thing when we'll touch on particular time period then the particular task should be displayed
__label__3 please reduce the font size in widget so that more items can be shown in a smaller window there are not so many options so it shouldn't be any issues with click target size etc check how google calendar widget shows information in agenda mode
__label__3 this app is good but it will be extra good if the developer put an option to continous timing for focus i believe there should not be any kind of limit like 10 min remove it or give an option to set custom time in hour and minute
__label__5 this app is a gold standard for life and work management
__label__3 i would've given it full cuz its an amazing app and i would recommend it but the down is that it takes too long to set a schedule otherwise it is an awesome app
__label__1 two word paid mess please dont waste data and get tricked by editors choice just go for a better app
__label__3 great job on the app for improvements sake i would make the lists have a font size option or something where if the 'items' in the to do list are more than a few words they can look more organized given that the square resides in the middle of the 'to do item' to me they seem a bit crammed together
__label__1 the app is good but it is crashing a lot it is instructing to upgrade but i did not find any option for upgrade i am also a pro version user i have to uninstall the app and later re install it again to make it work for only 120mins
__label__3 nice app overall it does what it promises i have two issues with this 1 the widget seem broken previously when i click on the task and mark as complete now it takes me to the task management page and there is no way to mark that as complete from there i have to open the app to do that 2 there is no way to sort tasks based on date as a user when i open a task list i should see all tasks that are coming up so i can plan accordingly i have to manually do that when i mark as complete
"__label__3 can you make the graph fully editable eg without importing from calendars 
i want to be able to add stuff without it having to access my calendar"
__label__4 this app is cute and a great option to just setting a timer when working studying however several times i have gotten a wilted tree just because some other app sent me notifications when i myself did not touch my phone
__label__3 please also add the option to import few activities from any day instead of the whole day onto timeline of a routine further please add the feature of allowing a to start a routine custom routine using time interval instead of defining exact time because on some bad days due to unavoidable circumstances we are out of schedule and adding a fresh custom timetable for the day hurts a lot modifying timings for every activity for rest of its features it worth 5
__label__5 i love this i use it all the time to keep track of client appointments as well as keep notes of events extremely easy to use and set up a
__label__5 works great no ads no unnecessary complexity
__label__3 love the idea of the app but it's missing a key feature that i need in order to use it undated tasks should have the option of showing up every day under tasks from the calendar day view until completed if that isn't possible at least a view all tasks function would be helpful
__label__3 reminder notification tone is very low in volume
__label__2 this is a step down from wunderlist before deprecating wunderlist in favor of this app it should atleast have been brought to parity sharing is broken and even when it works i have to send a link to the other person it was so much simpler with wunderlist in the sharing with sms option the link and the text together require 2 texts why unhappy
__label__5 very useful app to track and keep record of your habits
"__label__3 i like this app but my routine won't work and notifications won't make 
sounds and not appear on screen"
__label__3 i personally would like to add to this app if i had a chance is change how the entires were set up you had to make up the name but it would make it better if it had a date and name to me it feels like something you can do on a piece of paper add more cool features that you can't find anywhere else
__label__3 wish the google assistant integration could be improved every time i ask it to set a ticktick reminder it just shows tiktok also every time i restart my phone i need to boot up the app otherwise the widget panel doesn't show up
__label__4 it's simple to use you don't need to be a coder to figure it out i like that there's a message board i am considering using it to form a support group so i can stay on track with my workouts also i didn't realize there are a lot of people who hate themselves for masturbating lol but it's good they can find support in the message board i read that you can only have 5 habits you can track i'm being pragmatic and starting out with 4 but eventually i will need more than 5
__label__3 app is getting more and more annoying additional features are forced on you and it lost a lot of its original functionality which was why i bought it most probably i won't renew my subscription
__label__1 the app felt good enough for me to buy the yearly subscription which i did and paid th 15 it requested but a week later they charged me 17 more euros to my credit card for the same subscription and the same features so i basically paid 32 that is a scam and unless i get my 17 euros back i'm gonna keep the rating at one star
__label__1 too complicated it probably has a lot of but it's not intuitive enough
__label__3 add an event to calendar but it gets saved on a random day not current day annoying
__label__1 looked good but wasn't after installing tasks my keyboard stopped appearing for all my apps it was only when i removed tasks as a last resort that the keyboard appeared again
__label__3 уууу
__label__1 would you please add day and night mode for widgets that would sync with system's day and night status thank you
__label__2 it displays awkwardly has backwards date malfunctions to a point where the widget does not display has a small central area has no 1x1 option has complicated descriptions for functionality that should be easy to understand but i can buy a widget pallet which many apps have as standard for free for 3 what's not to love
__label__4 a beautiful app but i would love an option where you dont have to set a time you just put it on and watch the trees grow as you work and come back to your phone an hour or two hours whenever youre done i also found that trees die if i dont come back fast enough after my timer expires like if i set my timer for 1 hour and i come back in 2 ill find the tree died thats weird is that a bug on my end beautiful app guys i love it but those things above would have me using it more
__label__5 i love this app it does not only track your habits but it also gives statics about how well you are progressing to make it a sustainable habit you can decide how long it takes you to make a habit sustainable
__label__3 bags lags usable but painful
__label__3 i completely understand how this app would be very helpful but i downloaded it so i could focus while doing my work i need to access google docs to be able complete my task but when i tried to use it it told me that i would have to kill my tree before i could this is my only problem
__label__2 ট য ব হর ইজন ট ল ফ ন ভ র ট ক ল ফল ট য ব ল খত অস ব ধ হচ ছ এব লগ ইন করত হয য ক ন অ য ক উন ট
__label__3 requesting for a dark interface and when will the google task integration come
__label__4 very nice app it would be helpful if it is integrated with outlook calender or can be added to outlook calender just like evernote and wunderlist are connected to it
__label__3 need the ability to create recurring tasks and then edit separate instances not the whole series or event and future instances i need to edit just a specific instance i think it used to work and give me the option to just edit this event but now that is gone
__label__2 the only part of this app that doesn't impress me is the widgets everything else is beautiful good visual layouts simple quick tracking but enough features to be flexible for different needs update 12 30 2019 the app no longer syncs and does not import data i've got a handy cvs export with 3 000 lines of habit data thank goodness but can no longer reccomend the app if it requires manual input to restore data
__label__2 why does the app keep showing server connection lost even though there is no problem with my network or internet server i can't open the app and refresh it at all
__label__3 the app is helpful and has nice features i would give 5 stars but you apparently you are not able to transfer your lists to another device unless you have exactly the same version i had to create all my lists from scratch
__label__2 themes and location based reminders are under subscription both are free on most of apps like this thanks but no i'll pass and keep using google keep
__label__5 better than previous app i used
__label__5 it really helps me stay organized and keep track of my goals
__label__1 cant change default theme to black it asks to change me plan from free to premium before doing so
__label__4 it's a good app it's pretty minimalist and works really well it just really bothers me that the undo button that appears when you make a change gets in the way of adding a new task and gets accidentally clicked so i have to wait for it to go away i would suggest for the developers to please take a look and see if you can adjust the placement of the buttons in this case thanks
__label__3 nice app i just cannot work out what these random numbers are within the pieces of the pie 35 30 7 35 30 8 35 30 8 35 it is clearly a countdown of some sort but bears no relevance to anything obvious how can i remove these update to reply thank you but i am seeing 7x this info around the pie and personally it serves little use can this function be disabled
__label__3 widget not making full use of size
__label__5 i used to use todoist for years but after switching to windows for my computer i realised how onesided their platform is ticktick is a great all rounder with all features available on all platforms and that makes it worth the subscription and 5 stars for me
__label__4 thanks for the tech support the app wasn't working properly before but now it runs fine the only probkem is that when i press the home button the tree doesn't die and the ambient sounds still play like the app is still open but it's fine because the tree will die if i go into any another app
__label__4 good could be better i can not find where you can have a task repeat every week month year
__label__3 i love the concept of habit bull but it isn't user friendly
__label__5 very useful i love it
__label__3 i'm using this app for quite some time it has big problems which forcing me look for another app it doesn't remind me on time all the reminders work when i open this app at that time it was too late what the use having this app please correct this problem or else i am happy the all the options and features thank you
__label__4 good
__label__5 very versatile and customizable still new to it but it looks very promising if not polished yet
__label__2 good design simple and clear but with the option to dig down for more details however they don't respond to emails and haven't released an update in over a year seems like this project was abandoned
__label__1 it has a lot of functionality bugs some of my events were not adding after restaring the app other events just disappeared etc i m really sorry i had to delete it because it looked nice and could be very useful but it s not working thanks
__label__3 works great except for you have to have upgrade to be able to have more than five habits
__label__5 handy app for reminding me what to get at the shop's and recording my hours as i'm a temporary placement employee
__label__3 it doesn't work offline and when i'm actually online i need also a vpn to use it
__label__2 could not get any realtime notification at all enabled all notifications android6 0 or higher option disabled battery optimization and other security settings the only time i get the notification is when i manually open the app itself but then it has already been past the time set
__label__5 i gave 5 to this app in the past but new updated routine list is so unsatisfactory a lot of scrolling older style was better
__label__4 this app is so robust i love it however i would love a quick add button in the notifications
__label__1 i use the pro version but what happened to the option to purchase holidays my christian and jewish holidays don't show up anymore
__label__4 meh doesn't have dark mode easier on the eyes that's the one thing that breaks it for me
__label__3 how to view statistics
__label__5 good
__label__5 the best app in the market for improving your daily habits i researched many habit apps in play store and finally concluded that this is the best one i changed my self a lot by regulary monitoring my habits through habitnow app the user interface is superb and quite simple also it provides habit statistics up to date you can also enter your habits according to the category like health nutrition etc a must have app for everybody
__label__3 the widget keeps distorting itself resize fixes it but not for long edit monthly widget nova launcher nova launcher has worled great for me trough several android versions i'm not going to the stock one your widget was also not working in android 8 nova i upgraded a few days ago
__label__1 forced to sign in no thanks
__label__3 i have the premium version i had been using wunderlist the most amazing todo app ever and very intuitive tick tick has worked well as wunderlist is no longer supported however some key things i truly miss push notifications when someone texts within the app notification that someone else has updated or completed a task or list copy and paste everything i need into a section as a single item in the list instead of everything becoming its own item in a list
__label__4 urgent where is your backup function to externally export task u would have received a 5 star from me if u had this function this app has almost everything except most important thing
__label__3 it's really motivating and would be perfect but it doesn't notif if your phone is locked you'll only know that the time is done when you check the app only then does it vibrate and notify you i've followed all the instructions but it still doesn't properly notif when locked have to look for a new app
__label__4 i've been using this amazing app for years and i read the chinese lunar calendar into the app recently what troubles me is that how to add an event into the lunar calendar and let the event repeat at the same time on lunar date every year thank you
__label__3 don't use it much
__label__5 so easy to use and the free options are generous
__label__3 this application is very good feature rich and most powerful even though you should add few features in the app 1 repeat frequency should have hourly and 30 minutes 2 add bullet points format in the notes section like google keep have 3 provide database backup option with google drive and dropbox
__label__5 great app synchs immediately intuitive love this app i've tried a few to do apps and this one is the best
__label__5 timetune is a great app too keep up with dailu routines it has many useful options and it's overall great
__label__5 good app 很棒
__label__4 i love this game it has helped me do much it's a bit of a learning curve it would be nice if challenges were visible from the app in all of the guilds and i would also like to see the last day and time that a habit was marked because the colors don't always change and if you have a lot of habits it gets confusing otherwise this app is brilliantly done and will be getting my monetary support in whatever way i can afford
__label__3 what about reminders
__label__3 it's a very nice app but they doubled if not even more the price of the most part of the threes
__label__5 this app has helped me stay off my phone at work instead of randomly looking at my phone and getting distracted i will plant a tree to grow for an hour and when the hour is over i look at my phone for 5 minutes then plant another tree i get so much more work done because i have a reason to not get distracted
__label__4 i have been using the pro version for several years now it has many nice features and sophisticated calendar widget with many customization options sadly lately there have been problems with task synchronization as i mostly use tasks todos for organizing and use multiple devices this is a big issue for me while developers are responsive and say it have fixed the problem it still persists at least for me
"__label__3 i can't register because everytime i trie it says only letters from a to 
z and only numbers from 0 to 9 but i follow that and it still says the 
same thing everytime i trie again probably because at the start it say 
login when im registering do please fix this"
__label__5 very good app
__label__5 amazing app helps in staying organised n focused whole day
__label__5 great app like that you can get a reminder for your task either as a notification or alarm one can also choose to write a task that doesn't have a reminder therefore you can also easily create lists like a shopping list it has the feature for quick add for that purpose
__label__3 i bought this because it has a really design and features but i to uninstall it because it's slow loading it's lagging
__label__1 bad ux
__label__5 great habit tracking app the only things i think could be improved are goal dates not automatically pushing back to match the day you edited a habit and being able to edit how you want to track a habit if you change your mind maybe i missed something but it seems like you have to recreate a habit in order to change how to keep track of it ex yes no or by keeping count with numbers i highly recommend this tool though it's a great place to start keeping track of habits
__label__4 need some more designs in app
__label__2 i am not receiving my notifications on any of my tasks projects i have scheduled so i end up missing out on things i want to take care of i have it turned on in settings why is that i utilize the smart schedule tool but still no notification pls help or fix
__label__2 clunky and very slow to load not fun at all just yet another task i had to deal with daily
__label__4 it's a really great all except that you can't make it buzz when you need to do something unless you pay
__label__4 very good tool to use one suggested feature for future development it would be helpful if an already set task could be dragged as a sub task for another already set task when reordering tasks by dragging them if the task is dragged over an existing task it should automatically become a sub task there the reverse should also be available to drag out a sub task by taking it in between two tasks
__label__5 so easy to use and the free options are generous
__label__5 so addicting especially for gamers who love to level up
__label__5 definitely download it its great
__label__5 still a great app though coming from wunderlist i don't understand the crappy import in wunderlist you add new tasks at the top of the list in todo at the bottom yet it imports the list as if it was wunderlist so all your lists will get new items added in todo at the bottom where you had your oldest entries in wunderlist all lists are basically inverted
__label__2 couldn't get past registration login i've never used the app before but when i tried to make an account it said that my email has been taken and when i went to login it just kept loading forever
__label__4 i preferred wunderlist but in general this is working too please allow the user to set a default time for reminder suggestions currently it suggests for example 3am in the morning not very useful
__label__5 great apps
__label__3 this app could have been the best i uninstalled it due to the widget error after restarting the phone it doesn't load i liked it but if it doesn't perform well on my need widget month calendar it's a nah
__label__3 i'm trying to add a task press add button the arrow and the task just disappeares quite simple functionality and even this with bugs
__label__2 i love the ease of the application and the setup i don't like that the way they send you reminders that are sometimes rude or shame based it doesn't make me want to try any harder when i get scolded for not fulfilling my goals positive encouragement as the best way
__label__2 the notification on my tickwatch c2 has no vibration please fix
__label__1 don't buy the premium version of this app synching doesn't work stick with the free version which would be 4 stars
__label__3 love the app but i used to enjoy when the forest filled up and the trees merged together i wish they could bring that back cuz i do a lot of my work in bursts of 10 25mins and i never get the chance to get the elaborate plants from the longer time requiremnents i took my review down to 3 stars because the plants are more expensive now which means there is less incentive to grow trees and save money because the goal of buying a new plant seems out of reach
__label__4 its useful
__label__1 automatically completes task for the day as i open the program i do not have any access to see what was completed or if i lost something important i have to do
__label__3 it would be nice if they had the option to list tasks from top down instead of down up where your first task is at the top instead of at the bottom
__label__2 update i did all the steps still not working it is getting frustrating i really love this app but off late it just keeps crashing can anybody help updated thanks for the reply there was no auto update option in my phone settings so i have disabled auto update in google play will it work
__label__5 omg just what i've been looking for and you can also have it on a desk top so whenever i'm working and can't reach my phone for booking clients this comes in handy can't wait to see what is coming soon edit i went on the computer to see if there is a major difference and omg there is i totally love the desktop site i cannot wait for more features to come i totally recommend this app to anyone so in love
__label__1 nice
__label__4 coming from good old wunderlist and this one is definitely a noticeable refinement one feature i'm missing from good old wunderlist is the ability to manually order tasks this comes handy at times in addition it would make sense to create a default reminder on the date of the task if such date is defined with this couple of additions it's an easy 5 stars for me
__label__4 i am very pleased with this planner it synchronizes easily with my google calendars and allows me to stay on my phone and computer with only one entry the free version does not include search and i have not found to make use of the various to do tabs as well schedule recurring events so i am going to try the paid version and see it meets the rest of my scheduling needs
__label__5 excellent app for time management and remainders
__label__5 such a cool app exactly what i was looking for and so easy to use
__label__3 i hope that they could have an alarm after the rest session ends
__label__5 it has all the practical features that i need in order to just keep my tasks and projects organized it is useful and user friendly i might go for the premium features if i see the need for them but even without premium it is still a very helpful application
__label__5 very useful
__label__3 not free free upto only 5 habbits
__label__1 want to like it so far half of the set up items aren't even showing up for my samsung s8 all the purple screens are blank was excited to try but it doesn't work
__label__2 seems to work great for me but my family have trouble accessing the app having to log into their microsoft account every single time get it together microsoft it's frustrating and ridiculous
__label__4 awesome app i like the daily work and habit tracking thanks guys
__label__4 good enough
__label__2 i had installed the trial version but did not use and it was of no use at my end to my surprise i see today getting an sms from vodafone to be charged rs 1028 for one year subscription i contacted vodafone and they told me to delete the app within 48hrs of installation which i did pl cancel this subscription as its of no use to me so that this charges could be credited back by vodafone to me developer pl refund back my money as i dont use it
__label__2 let's be honest here if you need help with basic habit management you won't use this regularly enough to help and if you're organized and have a good routine you don't need it a pointless novelty at best
__label__5 initially i thought this would be another app i get and forget about in a week not at all this app is working great for me i started planning and recording everything it is keeping me accountable for my focus it may sound stupid but it is fantastic
__label__4 works well the interface is a little odd you have to scroll down to see all the graphs
__label__3 longtime wunderlist user slowly getting used to the todo app so far it is ok there are still some features that were not included from wunderlist such as when a task is checked as completed it has to be manually moved into a folder i created called completed tasks in wunderlist a completed task was automatically moved to a completed task folder would like to see this executed in todo thank you
__label__4 i have been utilizing ticktick todo list for awhile now its a very solid application that helps ensure the important tasks in one's life are completed on time
__label__3 this app is actually wonderful i'm hoping you can add the forward and backward buttons on the widget potentially just as another available function of those virtual buttons like we have access to in the full app it would be nice to click forward through the calendar and then say click the clock center to refresh and reload with the current time
__label__3 displaying the contacts calendar of every google account cannot be deactivated in calendar tasks list it re activates immediately
__label__3 its ok
__label__5 latest update corrected a previous issue and developer was very good about replying to my messages use this app every day
__label__2 requires access to contacts to work
__label__5 i loved the idea and downloaded to try it this app is helping me a lot thank you btw i suggest you to do an ios version i have friends who want to use it too edit i'm sure it'll be a huge success there too
__label__4 неплохое приложение для поднятия своей дисциплины в игровой форме перейдем к минусам дорого за полную версию серьёзно 3400 рублей за полную версию навсегда это очень дорого мне кажется что автор случайно дописал лишний ноль 340 ладно 3400 дрого не всё доступно без полной версии это немного относится к первому минусу теперь плюсы повышение дисциплины в игровой форме например если быть чесным и выставлять адекватные награды то всё очень классно
__label__3 it crossed my mind to buy the full version but then i saw they want a monthly payment why not just make it 5 lifetime seems like a good app not sure who copied who with liferpg seems too similar
__label__3 i have purchased pro version but still no calendar view please add calendar view beside the timeline view
__label__4 this app is really usefull but i didn't figure so far how to set the app to wiyher my trees whenever i exit it use other apps while planting i saw a set of instructions but nine were helpful for the samsung device i posses i need to say i really except an answer that can help me solve my problem
__label__2 used to be a great app though the most recent update has made the widget unusable too small to see and there is no way to change the size you also can no longer select multiple tasks or pop out the widget to see multiple days i requested to go back to the previous version but didn't get much response so now i'm looking for a replacement
__label__4 easy to use and does it job to keep me on track
__label__2 premium version only
__label__4 easy to use and good at keeping me motivated throughout the day
__label__3 helps me stay organized
__label__5 good
__label__1 um you need to pay for the duration of the task no thanks i will just find a new app
__label__4 very helpful in getting me to do stuff but i wish reminders were free
__label__5 just wow
__label__1 this app is a very very poor replacement for wunderlist which is a wonderfully organized app wonderlist should never be taken out of the app market in my opinion it's the microsoft app that should disappear on may 6 not wunderlist wunderlist has a 4 6 approval rating microsoft has a 4 2 rating that should tell you something it took an act of god for my microsoft account to get up and running it was locked and i was forced to jump through several hoops ridiculous
__label__4 hello this app is great but i have a suggestion with the inventory items please make it so you can give them attribites such as 10 xp gain or 10 gold gain or just 10 xp for a specific skill
__label__3 i want to be able to set so that the week starts from sunday highly inconvenient for i frequently set the reminder wrongly a day behind please upgrade so that the week start from sunday
__label__2 love it and it's good start to build on but there appears to be syncing issues between calendars no matter how many times i refresh i'm going to give it time before i give up on it i'm big on my happy planner and would totally ditch it for this if it had similar features such as a budget planner one could add i wouldn't use most of the stickers which is unfortunate because i love my stickers in my planners overall good start
__label__4 this tool really helps me see my progress so that i can feel motivated to change when i see that i have been on a successful streak it helps me believe that i can make positive changes for real and forever i only did four stars because if you want to track more than 5 things you have to pay also their forums seem to only feature drug and sex addicts it's kind of creepy really but you aren't required to participate so i ignore it
__label__3 not so easy to figure out i still don't get how to enter achievements in terms of goals such as if i practice 15 mins but the goal was 30 no help in app
__label__3 good app but it needs a web application
__label__2 if u want to study you need to plan don't use apps
__label__3 my personal experience with the app makes me say this is deforme designed more as a task management app than a habit tracking app the two things i want to do when building a new habit are 1 easily enter the stats for the habits i'm tracking and 2 see the timeline of the habit growth in a snapshot or as a dashboard this app focuses on today's tasks so getting to the specific habits entering information for another day and charting progress are too cumbersome
__label__3 has potential but the interface isnt user friendly at all
__label__4 quite confusing
__label__5 started using this about a year ago and it quickly became a fixture on my home screen it functions about as you would expect out of the box which is nice because navigating the customization leaves a little to be desired
__label__3 quite good but the week widget is imho absolutely wrong the order of the weekdays should be first vertical then horisontal i e tuesday under monday not to the right
__label__3 this is a great app and would be 5 stars the reason it isn't the early reminder notifications stopped working for me at all they had been working fine then for no reason that i can find they stopped i've tried reinstalling the app but this didn't fix it i am getting a reminder at the time my tasks are set for or 3 4 minutes late though it's incredibly frustrating as this is the only app i've found that offers early reminders and i'm trying to use that to complete tasks on time
__label__3 worked great until the app started calling me pet names in the notifications i'm not trying to be catcalled by my phone and my natural reaction was to ignore it like i would anyone else who calls me sugar i have not formed the habits i wanted to as a result
__label__3 as a to do list it works ok devs need to allow manual sorting of priority though i think this app has much greater potential if it were to be integrated with outlook including meetings appointments along with tasks becoming more of an overall assistant rather than a to do list one major gripe though the point type on the widget is miniscule and barely readable
__label__3 not bad
__label__1 did not work on my amazon fire 8 app just flashed abou a mile a minute and nothing could be selected
__label__4 pretty good at what it does exactly what i needed however there is a small bug weekly review widget does not show all my habits moreover i miss a feature to periodically share my weekly monthly reviews on social media or with at least with someone accountability helps
__label__3 good great greatest very good nice decent adjusting
__label__5 great to help organize
__label__4 better to have a search option for notes
__label__5 excellent app really useful for writing down what you have to do it lets you manage your to dos in convenient groups and the feature my day is awesome for planning your day ahead
__label__3 this app doesnt require your firstborn in order to function as similar apps do the quick post function is great however unlike other similar apps this doesnt have a widget feature to show what the upcoming daily task is on the screen so for me that is really unfortunate if this changes i will gladly give this a perfect rating
__label__5 very happy with the features of this app
__label__5 best to do list app better than anything
__label__5 really great for staying organized super easy to use
__label__3 not satisfy
__label__4 it seems to be a good wonderlist option good notifications and i enjoy having the full calendar available
__label__5 i have tried many time managing apps and i like this one the most
__label__3 i started playing with it and it freezes often and i don't like how my notes have to be on that day and not just by themselves
__label__1 can't sign in and there are reviews from october saying the same so no improvement over months of having the same issue
__label__5 this works like a pomodoro style of focusing but with a little fun thing very nice
__label__3 ok
__label__4 the new widget is an improvement but the fact that i can no longer open the app from the widget is immensely frustrating it means i have to waste home screen space in the app icon and isn't that what a widget is supposed to avoid
__label__3 it doesnt seem to be possible to delete a single event in a series so if i want to block off an hour every day for the same thing but then i have to schedule a one off thing during that time i can't just delete one occurence and leave the rest of the future occurences alone i love the app otherwise but this problem is pushing me toward a different app
__label__4 the statistics section needs some work
__label__5 first i was skeptical about this app but only a few weeks in and i already see myself adjusting a couple things in my life amazing how this works thanks guys
__label__4 love it
__label__1 why cant i set monthly habits also habits should repeat x days weeks months after completion you should not define which weekdays for example you should just say x days after last completion that is how people use habits in real life
__label__3 i wish widget would have a very compact design just a list of tasks nothing more no menu bar no headers etc as for me the widget eats too much of homescreen space and is not optimised
__label__3 the layout for the app is awesome but it would be better if non routine task can be added into the timeline with the same activity for routine task
__label__3 that's right nice addon but haven't really seen its power yet as i still don't have those colorful sectors show on the app
__label__1 waste of time unusable cannot delete events
__label__2 when my phone is ringing although i didn't answer my tree is killed what should i do also voice call or video call in what s app cause the kill the trees
__label__1 this app used to be great now it is garbage a few months ago it started doubling a few tasks no problem i just delete the extras now i get 5 to 10 copies of every task i delete it is worthless i can't forget the wait times to open the app up to 8 minutes of staring at a black screen oh and the fact that in the past week or two it started giving me ads even though i have been using the paid version for years already i let them know a couple weeks ago and got no response
__label__4 i have been using this premium version of app from past 6 months and its really great but i still believe there are few feature still missing in it to make things easy like there should be dashboard which gives details of all habbits progress in bar percentage marked successful currently you have to go to each habbit and check the status so a centralized section giving more details on the progress would be helpful like it is in habbit tracker app also a dynamic habbit counter could be added
__label__1 it seems ok but very basic recurring tasks need some work to be actually useful for example it would be nice to be able to set a task to be recurring on the first of every month without only being able to set that up on the first of the month edit i also just noticed that there is no dark theme both may be available as paid for options but i'll never know since they are basic options and without them i have no reason to try this app and thus will never pay for actual premium options
__label__3 works well and syncs well with the chosen calenders
__label__1 there seems to be no way to actually mark a task as complete so i had to delete the tasks i actually did complete and therefore have not gotten in game rewards there is also no way at all to contact support if you join the habitat help guild that is supposed to allow you to ask questions there is no obvious way to post a question there there is a button to leave the guild but not one to post a question this app is terrible and is a waste of time
__label__3 nice app but requires payment for basic features
__label__1 i hate it
__label__2 set up was glitchy i didnt get further than that it's a great concept though and the art is cute
__label__2 the app keeps crashing and hanging recently after i am done with the entire duration no coins could be accumulated
__label__4 this app is really good i want to suggest to that the app should have a rest day option or something similar that you can activate it anytime you want and while activated the tasks will be put into a halt including penalty and overdue it is useful if you are on vacation or there's an occasion you need to attend and makes you unable to finish the daily tasks
__label__2 if you want to start a project you have to pay 4 99 a year
__label__3 it was essential to me until the last updates
__label__5 i love it keeps me focused and the store items are so cue
__label__4 very good well it's a great app i just wish we had more free features it would be a rmgrest investment
__label__3 there is no way to edit repetetiveness through ui unless i know the smart commands
__label__2 this thing is terrible i couldn't do anything i wanted
__label__3 functional but not very stable
__label__1 one of the main sticking points for me is how well an app does recurring tasks in particular not just fixed date recurrences but the ability to set the next date off the last completion date so many apps fail to offer this alas i could find no way to do a recurring task at all in spite of them saying it can be done so much less checking on this nuance i see no way of doing them at all fail moving on
__label__3 at times it doesn't work as expected hut the app can be great potential if scrutinized aptly
__label__3 i loved this app when i first got it though i still find it useful the app vs desktop functionality leaves something to be desired still i would have given a higher rating if the app didn't have a habit of moving tasks to a random calendar date instead of the one i selected i'm not sure i'll purchase a second year subscription
__label__3 for some reason syncing is broken in the latest update
__label__3 it does the job
__label__1 really disappointed to find recurring tasks functionality is only available with the paid version would not recommend also it doesn't sort tasks by date and time properly
__label__5 it is inviting which makes it very usable
__label__1 find a new app overall if you havent noticed the dev's left this app as of recently the servers are dead this means you cant make an account forums are gone motivation pictures gone etc find a new app
__label__4 very nice app adds pop up randomly but not bothersome very useful to set up a routine to follow good work developers quite flexible but could work more like a calendar that way each day is tailored as you like but i also like the option of having set a routine once it applies for as many days as you want
__label__4 very useful and flexible for scheduling tasks it can be better by employing ml to guess the best choice of time for any task
__label__1 no trial to try premium features what's the point trying app without able to set reminders
__label__4 after testing the app for a while i was ready to purchase it but read on your user guide that searching for tasks is not available on android do you know when it would be available also is there a one time fee purchase option is there a gmail integration feature like google tasks i like the minimalist simplistic clean look of your app nice work on the widgets thanks
__label__3 very nice very simple very usefull but the free mode is too annoyingly limited looking forward to having the ability to link habits with my wife or friends
__label__5 microsoft to do keeps my wife and i on the same page we use it increasingly to help us plan and track routine tasks or specific projects around the house through shared lists because microsoft to do lets you create customizable list it can be adapted to almost any purpose or project more specifically we share a grocery shopping list chore list meal planning list including ingredients recipe a travel checklist and a gift tracking lists the attach file option is a big bonus
__label__2 since last major update rescheduling a task takes you to the day where it is scheduled preventing you from quickly rescheduling all tasks on a given day productivity killer
__label__1 stealing in 2020 make an app call it habitbull make people buy it remove it from playstore republish the same app with a different name
__label__5 it's for keep
__label__5 a great way to work on self improvement with friends hold eachother accountable and have fun
__label__1 forced to move from the fantastic wunderlist import fails that's an import of 100 pieces of text on a modern mobile phone pitiful
__label__5 amazing app has everything i want from a time management app
__label__1 good app appallingly bad support paid for premium and enjoyed the app for 2 years old phone died now can't restore the data on the new phone the ligin is not recognized noone replying to the emails so much for premium quick googling reveals many people experience the same frustrating
__label__1 really disappointed to find recurring tasks functionality is only available with the paid version would not recommend also it doesn't sort tasks by date and time properly
__label__3 i went from touching the app once a day to once a week over the span of about 2 months would be better if notifications were functional could be enabled i like the concept of being a hero though i just always fail all my daily set tasks repeatedly back to level 0 hahaha i stick to my sticky notes app with reminders that i've been using for years edit 11 10 19 i see notifications on appear on my phone now thank you
__label__2 it was good until they introduced long adverts every time you add an entry how to annoy your users i won't be forced to pay i have given good feedback in the past and good feedback encourages others to pay now you have decided to make the free version really annoying to use you are creating bad feedback good luck
__label__5 great simple app i wish it easily sync'd across devices i also would love a calendar view i can see print so i can visually see my progress over time
__label__3 overall great app but it never gives me notifications so it kind of defeats the purpose of having it
__label__3 i need more time with your app i'm looking for an organizing app to meet the needs of me and my gaming community to be able to cross schedule events share valuable information w aarach while i know that was never your vision i am impressed with the very easy to use ui but have not figured out if u can share projects notes calandars ect i cam see your app meeting a very large need in a community the desperately needs an easy way to collaborate adding a group's feature to cross plan 5 stars
__label__1 worse than wunderlist also i have no interest in having to log into a microsoft account to use this account i'll look for an alternative
__label__1 this app isn't even that good i downloaded it and i feel like it kinda threatens people with tree and says if you leave your wasting a tree we aren't even helping a tree it is just a silly app
__label__3 originally had it at 5 stars but every time i study now my friends list is completely innacurate it won't show the correct amount of hours i've studied for on my friends list e g today i've done 70 minutes but it comes up as 20 very annoying
__label__3 the app is overall good just bought the upgraded version since i wanted to sync the google calender i still cannot sync the google calender into the calender and also would like to know if sync the 'routine' from timetune into the google calender is possible thanks
"__label__3 i like this app but my routine won't work and notifications won't make 
sounds and not appear on screen"
__label__3 the website is buggy but enjoyable the app however feel almost nonfunctional
__label__3 looked good at first sight but as i was using it i wondered that the icon disappeared miraculously couldn't continue using it until i uninstalled and reinstalled it
__label__1 won't show events i add to it makes different events random flags or sectors for no particular reason really annoying
__label__5 great works with my google home so i can just blurt out stuff that pops into my head without interrupting what i'm doing i would like a bit more control over the details and settings in the app itself but that's just me
__label__4 very helpful please add more habits for the free version
__label__1 this basically is just a purple version of google calendar it has the almost exact same layout as google calendar without any extra features i wanted to use this as planner for school seperate from my calendar but there was no way to have it not sync with google don't bother getting this app just use calendar directly
__label__3 the app work just fine it was my commitment that had problem
__label__5 i love gamification at work creating a simple customizable system for home life is great
__label__3 difficult to figure out how to indent or provide a sublist
__label__3 good simple app and interface well made would prefer a free advert monetization model than sub model i dont plan to pay monthly and free version is somewhat limited for my purposes
__label__4 does the basics clearly and easily i particularly like that it allows you to sort completed tasks in alphabetical order some other apps don't
__label__2 really disappointed with the full screen adverts now taking over this otherwise great app will be uninstalling and choosing another alternative app there are plenty big mistake by the developer
__label__5 i use this for organizing my homework and it's very helpful 10 10 recommend it's simple to use it's pretty and it has tons of features my favorite is the sub tasks as it allows my to have a each subject as a task and all the assignment in that subject as sub tasks thx for making this wonderful app
__label__1 don't lock reminders behind a pay wall or if you do make it a 1 time purchase
__label__3 not user friendly free version very limited
__label__1 forest app is working what to do i allow all step what you asked yet my app is not working my phone is realme please send me step by step process to activate app on my phone please and i' m trying to problem with screenshot to skeertech but didn't get reply so please help me
__label__5 super useful for the lockdown
__label__3 the interface is intuitive i am giving a three because my online data did not sync when i upgraded
__label__3 keeps me focused but i don't want to purchase anything i think it could all be free in my opinion
__label__3 new update was step backwards my recommemdations 1 have daily weekly monthly calendar views that show reminders and events in visual boxes instead of just a list 2 allow rearranging of the order of subtasks and add subtask reminder capability also should be able to check off individual subtasks 3 allow a task to be turned into a calendar event instead of just a reminder 4 show that an event has subtasks from main view
__label__3 not enough customatization
__label__5 helpful keeps everything easily accessible via the widget
__label__3 good planner and reminder
__label__3 i am in love with this app so far i wish there was an ios version available to connect with my friends though i would recommend this to everyone otherwise 3 stars for now due to limited availability
__label__1 it's a good app but there should be downloadble templates since it would take time and a lot harder to create your own design
__label__2 can't sync calendar unless you pay which makes the unpaid version useless to me i'm not going to go through my entire calendar and add my events by hand to a second calendar pointless
__label__1 pop up stating the app has been blocked by the system please authorize the app in your device settings troubleshooting or refresh background tasks is flashing on my device may i know what is this about
__label__4 like the app but wish it had widgets to be able to see calendar at all times
__label__2 first time opening good experience everything from google calendar was synced then stacked up my events for the day opened the app a few hours later and absolutely everything was blank and you have to pay 7 to be able to drag and drop your events
__label__5 best calendar app used bc for a few years now and occasionally retried other calendar apps found this is still best one out there by far
__label__1 the reminder doesn't work at all
__label__3 only premium is good free version has nothing
__label__3 to finish scheduling a task you must click a small arrow in the top left corner clearly the development team never tested this becsuse it feels horrible
__label__5 very flexible and the customization is huge
__label__4 i really like this app for the most part but i really don't like how the month view in app and on the widget don't actually list out what you have on that day just colored dots would really like to be able to have this since i paid for the pro version please consider
__label__3 having some equipment related bugs
__label__1 does not integrate well across multiple cross platform devices more upsetting to discover this after paying for the app
__label__3 its awesome but needs an improvement it would be nice if i could visit my notes and edit my notes online in my pc not just through the phone
__label__3 update to my original review to clarify i'm saying that in previous versions you could choose which list to put the task under when doing a quick add of it via the widget on home screen and same for adding it from the bottom quick bar in the app in the current version it doesn't allow you to choose the list when doing a quick add your reply to my review is describing the regular long way of adding the task i want to be able to choose the list when quick adding from the widget
__label__3 impressive
__label__4 easy to use
__label__1 impossible to delete list or sub lists tabs regret v2 0 upgrade
__label__3 navigation needs work you can only navigate with the many buttons in the app the back button closes the app feature request has weekly and monthly report would like a daily report to share with an accountability partner also would be great to generate report based on category
__label__5 great
__label__5 love the desktop version ability to quickly add task using shortcut is my fav without having to go application window i wish there was an ability to add comments in free version
__label__3 i like this app actually purchased the plus version but i'm haven't seen any notifications the purpose of using a scheduling app is to receive reminders of your appts or pending tasks
__label__3 app has kept organization relatively simple the past several weeks i have no prob giving this 5 except having issue on my tablet viewing monthly calendar off center i find myself going back forth btwn tablet phone if this is a settings issue that can be resolved pls advise overall i think the app could help many out there
__label__3 an ok but expensive app
__label__3 how can i take the notes i have made and copy them over to my laptop i have looked to see where the notes save to but can't seem to find them anywhere please help me
__label__2 i tried out this app but decided not to go with it because it wasn't as intuitive as i like and might be missing some features imagine my annoyance to receive a reminder email this morning when i specifically turned off all notification settings this app is probably great for people who like to be nagged i don't i like to be organized
__label__4 im using the free app enjoying it alot super easy to capture ideas and reminders when they pop into your head before you forget
__label__3 the only problem i have come across so far is the day calendar does not change automatically in order to get the current date on the day calendar is to go to the month calendar and select today's date that said the program and ui is better than the pre installed calendar program
__label__5 almost perfect simple to use i like that you can add tasks for each day however you don't get the week view on the free version annoying
__label__2 good app but skills glitch out all the time fix this for 5 stars
__label__5 i love habitica i am particularly bad at getting things done and this app has helped me improve so much it's as it says gamifying your tasks i am on level 12 and i have only been doing it for a week if you need a pick me up with your chores and todo lists then check it out
__label__3 this app is ok the thing that makes it stand out for me is that i've been able to set it up to work with google home as my grocery and to do list however since the update i now can't click into the full app from the widget which is necessary as i'm unable to rearrange my tasks from the widget and i can't seem to find a way so that the app automatically sorts my tasks by 'priority' i can only see how to do it afterwards
__label__5 easy simple
__label__3 i m not getting daily reminders for my habits
__label__2 certain pages don't fit on screen
__label__5 smooth and easy to use no disruptive ads and no annoying interface overlays
__label__4 overall a good app to manage your tasks a good planner with nice ui and charts
__label__4 i wish i could give it 5 stars only thing missing is a windows linux app for syncing which i can't do without and that's the only thing keeping me away i would happily pay for that feature if you just need an android app no need to look elsewhere it has everything you can ask for the ui is great and very intuitive
__label__2 i like the app except for some reason it now says it doesn't work with my account even though i can use it everywhere else i've done all the it things i can think to do but to no avail guess i'll be looking elsewhere now
__label__3 not so great add birthdays and they disappear as soon as i save used to love it now looking for another love
__label__3 i like this app but it would be better if the duplicate list feature is included in the mobile version
__label__5 its a nice app a plesent representation of what you put in your task list to do list or meeting list learning the app and for myself getting everything to sync up properly took a little bit of patience but i got it and all's good
__label__5 very easy to use
__label__1 wouldnt let me make an regular account without linking something to it
__label__5 i love this app i tried a lot of apps and choose this because the alarm sound function if this app can have the challenge friends functions it will really good more but for now everything is perfect
__label__4 guys i really want to like this app more and give it 5 stars everything is there and i can see the work and effort that has gone into making it so thank you so much but on android the habits screen is quite buggy and won't let me adjust the streaks the keyboard comes up but closes immediately so i can't do anything the dailies work fine i look forward to any updates you're planning but considering this is free i think what you've achieved is great
__label__3 please use the app the widget and see for yourself if ur comfortable with it compare it with s planner
__label__3 it's ok for now havent really done much with the app yet
__label__4 i love the app it has helped me a lot by helping me easily track my habits i gave it a four because i sent them an email months ago they never answered
__label__4 it keeps reminding me even after the task is done and it was adjusted according to how many times i should be notified but overall nice app
__label__3 i have been using this app for years and have loved it but the latest version is sucking my battery it's very frustrating
__label__4 find this a great app full diary views to do lists and appointments can be on home screen i have it on both my tablet and phone only problem i find is that sometimes it stop syncing
__label__5 superb useful handy easy together with very attractive looks
__label__5 super easy and has changed my life in a number of very positive ways excellent tool buy the full version if you are able certainly worth it
__label__3 overall it is a nice clean design but reminders seem useless as i'm not given an option to change the time it's currently 1 45 and no matter what it sets the reminder to 2 tapping reminder just turns it on off long press and swipe do nothing also no due dates today list for helping with daily agendas
__label__1 premium does not work false advertising
__label__3 very good
__label__2 i find the app inflexible and buggy with a counter intuitive ui how to delete or rename tags was not obvious using the back button would often exit the app at unusual times after adding a new tag the app wouldn't allow me to do anything until i exited and restarted plus the premium features seem more like essential features to me looking for an alternative app as we speak
__label__3 everytime i wanted to swap between month day it lags so much if only it was smooth then i am very excited with the app i am using lenovo a7 3000
__label__3 no japanese support
__label__4 seems almost perfect i'm missing a monthly view feature of the tasks assignments etc
__label__3 there's an option to add multiple accounts but it keeps getting sign out
__label__1 this app is supposed to replace wunderlist this app requires you to have an outlook account ok fine it is not easy to invite others not user friendly always logs out and requires you ok sign into account live will not recommend at this time
__label__1 looks really complicated and it's entirely prescription based i felt like i needed to take a class to learn it there are a lot of apps like this i'll try another one
__label__1 the big problem is that task management should work offline and habitica should have synchronization feature like anki mobile and anki pc
__label__1 i have used this app for years but there is now a major issue if you drag a task to tomorrow or place it under a task with a later date the task date no longer changes date is there any way to revert to an earlier revision hi i have sent screenshots but the issue is the same
__label__3 been using for couple of years with no issues till the recent update with ad pushing well can't really complain coz we're using it for free but it's too distracting when you're checking your appt during crunchtime unstalling as a result reverting back to plain old no fuss google calendar tks though
__label__3 good idea but this isn't for me i am much more for classic habit apps
__label__5 awesome app love the looks
__label__2 this is very good app but the monthly cost or yearly cost are not worth it for me i found a free app that does tbe same things
__label__3 good app that i can use for putting all my appointments in one problem is that the notifications i set to make sure it reminds me don't go off at all i have a droid turbo 2 if you guys could fix that i will change to 5 stars
__label__2 unable to register via manual and via fb
__label__4 this will meet many people's needs best multi platform apps best location reminders easy to use i would like start dates and others have requested them for years but todoist refuses to add them down a star for that the offer a work around but it's not convenient
__label__4 good
__label__3 cannot sync with google task
__label__4 i like this app quite a bit it has more useful features compared to the normal samsung calendar app it does not however play well with google in that i can't ask google what my agenda is and have it pull info from this app lame hence 4 stars only not sure if that's a google thing or a thing for this app otherwise i like it a lot
__label__1 looks great alarms don't work the notifications just don't work on my motorola g7 plus running android 9
__label__3 loved it initially but after a while the notifications would stop showing up and i was constantly having to refresh background tasks too much for me to use often
__label__4 its pretty good so far my dailies just seem to never reset though i got a streak of 2 and from then on it never moved forward
__label__2 i like the app but you can't tick thing's off i like to go through my tasks and tick each one off as i do it then i feel i am accomplishing something i feel i am getting somewhere if it had that it would be brilliant
__label__3 i can't arrange my habits in the order i want i have to choose from preselected options like alphabetical
__label__2 i have used this awesome app for 3 years at least sleek convenient powerful but the recent updates just bring more and very intrusive ads if that is not reverted soon i will have to change app pissed by how awesome app become awful because someone wants to make money out of other's great job and thanks for your copy pasted answer
__label__3 first impression is sufficient but not excellent there are no settings for applying priorities to tasks and i couldn't find also a setting for repeating tasks daily or for certain periods for specified hours from 17 00 20 00
__label__5 i came from wunderlist as i got an email said it was shutting down on march 6th i was expecting a sub par experience having to re enter all of my tasks and data i was very surprised as it was a great switch over experience with very little input from me it also has a very similar widget which im very happy with thank you for considering wunderlist users
__label__5 the app is really great and don't even need the paid version unlike what people said i found it quite easy to set up i wish the custom repeat had option to choose which day of the week and not the frequency of days as my schedule varies schema as 4 days a followed by 3 days b i really love the widget option also i just downloaded it but if i keep using it then i will consider buying the pro version to support the creators
__label__4 really enjoy the app probably wouldnt recommend unless you have someone to do it with also please set up a system of 'weekly' tasks currently you can only set a daily that you complete once a week but it would be nice to have the flexibility of doing a task any day that week without being penalised
__label__2 reminder is not working in realme phone i did all the settings in my phone and app settings but still not working
__label__2 permissions it's all or it's none won't operate attachments can't do it unless you go into a desktop pc browser on google calendar
__label__4 is working as described could offer deleatable holiday date names with drag drop rescheduleling a query window where user could use a window of time such as 3 30pm to 8 30pm 6 days a week s mtwtf with 30 minute travle time and locate new appointment opening automatically it has been a useful app so far
__label__2 i've set a reminder for me to drink water it doesn't remind at all
__label__3 could be a great app except that like another user said it does not sync between devices when the description claims that it can that's a big letdown for me because when used any other of my devices and when i switched phones i couldn't sync the app up with my data or any habits i've been tracking even though i have the premium account when attempting to sync it always says that there is no internet connection but there always is so i can't give it a full 5 5 rating otherwise i might
__label__2 was and is a great app used it for years but now the fullscreen ads are an immediate turnoff small ads down the bottom were fine but forcing me to sit through a full screen ad till the timer runs out is a huge no for me uninstalling cos there are plenty of other free calendar apps around that don't force you to wait through adverts
__label__3 might be good but it doesn't have task library and trying to set everything up myself is not worth it
__label__5 love love love the app i love the colors i love that i can change or edit my list i just found out i love that i can copy my list and make him into a sub list i love that it has easy swipe to delete them i love that i can have several lists under one sub list i have several different notes list apps and this one is by far number one the best
__label__5 initially it didn't let me view the shopping list synced from alexa on my android smart watch however as the developer says if it is added to the favorites alexa shopping list gets synced
__label__2 confused i planted a tree but instead of killing the tree i can just leave it running in the background and the tree still grows
__label__2 confusing and what they don't tell you before you download is that you have to pay for mostly all the features
__label__5 i'll try this one
__label__3 love the app but since the update it closes every time i try to access the store
__label__1 last update deleted all my tasks looking for another app
__label__4 you should keep recurring tasks for free that is the only reason i left using your app four years ago and started to use google keep everything else is great
__label__5 pretty useful and organized so far
__label__5 muito útil em poucas palavras é o que esse app é
__label__1 i have been a big fan of todoist for years i tried this last week and the themes are awful
__label__3 hi love the app so paid to remove adds on my phone but they are still showing on my tablet how do i remove
__label__3 the app was working great up until recently now i cant click on the date and update it directly through the widget i have to open the app and make changes through there what happened
__label__3 the time displayed does not automatically update one has to cluck on the widget and enter the app for it to sync with actual time
__label__3 app ui is really good i have tried almost all the top task list apps and like any do best however would like to have heisenberg matrix added to organise my tasks that is the one thing stoping me i want the quadrants features in this app and i would be absolute member of this app until forever
__label__4 i'm using the app couple of years and i really nice it just really annoying when the reminder message pops up while you type a message or during the call while hanging up
__label__2 24 hrs shouldn't be extra cost can't import from my google calendar and too many left and right arrows confusing too few colours for the sectors
__label__3 needs fixes like the repetition is screwed also the generate habit looks like the developers don't use it themselves
__label__2 i put an event in and it doubles everyday fix the glitches this is a great app otherwise
__label__5 good
__label__3 probably a good app and way to track your new habits but not being able to make a widget without a premium account is ridiculous
__label__3 i really love the idea this app has but it has some bugs the first 2 pages are blank and when i had to make my character everything was blank too after updating the app it was still the same im using a samsung s8 if thats important hope you guys fix it cuz i'd love to use the app
__label__3 first reaction to new design much worse now cluttered how can i allocate from inbox to task group or whatever they're called why break this when it worked frustrating i otherwise love todoist it is seamless and i have been managing tasks with that for ages clearing my mind thx for response below but pls don't break what works nicely
__label__5 tried all habit tracker apps it's the best one yet just please add an option to the calendar icon so i can see all the habits tasks together at the calendar read their notes or success failure rate keep up the good work
__label__5 lots of fun
__label__4 5 5 5 0 habits widget improved but lacking needs also single column layout for habits widget the good 1 some offline 2 habits 3 pomo timer 4 dark theme 5 sorting lists only paid the bad 1 too expensive to use basic features make it 10 lifetime 2 social aspect sucks needs public leaderboard open to free users search find add users 3 limited export feature use titanium backup share option ok but only one list need full backup export all 4 need 100 offline mode
__label__5 i just downloaded this app and i can tell that it's very useful and user freindly i used other apps to organize myself but this one takes the cake and on top of that the developers owner of this app responds to issues or suggested features unlike other apps i've used that's the main reason i think this app is great
__label__3 the app and widɡet are very ɡood will change to 5 start when i can be able to add task using google assistant
__label__4 i've been using this app since the beginning of december and it has really helped me with keeping on track with tasks and developing habits however there are a few issues with the party features when a message is sent in the chat no one is notified and we cannot respond appropriately unless we actively check the chat and members tab also tends to not load up and i have to leave the app in order for it to work again navigating the app is also quite a hassle but it isn't a major issue
__label__3 full package for idr 139000 got a 33 discount but still idr 139000
__label__5 easy to use and access helpful reminder especially on busy days
__label__1 why does it require sign up edit in response to the reply it is ridiculous that i couldn't even try the app before providing you with my details i've now found a wonderful app that allows me to skip the sign up unless i wish to sync etc i'll be sticking with that app because it is perfect and i only need to provide the info i wish to
__label__1 i like the app but i don't like rating apps and this one constantly nags you to do so with no option for it to stop even with the paid version so 1 star for being annoying after i've given them my money
__label__3 i cannot givey opinion because i cant install the app
__label__2 i had added a routine by default it took a date almost 8 days ahead from today's date i m unable to change the date it's frustrating
__label__3 the app is ok but it could be much better in terms of usability for example 1 when setting a new reminder the first button which you are most likely to press without thinking should be 'set timer' not 'share the task' more people will want to set a reminder than share a person note 2 the 'focus' button when the reminder comes up is in the prime location for when you are typing using your phone and leads to you accidentally cancelling reminders each time
__label__1 did not like the way of interfaced that all
__label__3 having to find players to be able to do anything is a bit annoying it's really boring otherwise reminders don't work properly i set a bunch for last night that never happened and a bunch this morning that never happened it's not really built for proper daily routines including things you need to do twice per day so it's not really useful for me
__label__3 this was the absolute best calendar app out there for anyone placing productivity at the top of the list downgrading because recently the location autofill function is not working very well i've had to rely on other calendar apps to add appointment meetings and events
__label__1 as with other ms products too many useless features
__label__2 annoying to set up you'd think it would be easy to have the exact same same schedule just 30 min later
__label__3 android widgets don't work anymore clicking on done circle but nothing updates only by restarting the phone removing and re adding widget to screen uninstalled
__label__4 this is the only app that does what it does and i love the functionality the only problem is the app is quite buggy and i haven't seen or noticed any updates in years would also be nice if there was a website to go with it i am finally giving up and moving to day by day which leverages google calendar and google tasks if google would just incorporate tasks into its calendar better that would do it all
__label__5 if you are looking for a perfect organiser of your time this is the app for you love it and you will too if you are like me and want some organisation in your life perfect
__label__1 well i just got it and attempted to create an account and after unfilled out the info it would not submit it what gives
__label__5 great application to organize a schedule especially procrastinators
__label__3 don't get any reminders for the goals inspite of setting it a number of times
__label__5 better than trello for personal everyday gtd
__label__3 i like the app but i'm not getting notifications of reminders have checked all the settings might be that my phone's too old to be fully compatible
__label__3 edit just switched to s new phone in the process i lost reminders and recurrence for my tasks i have to set it up all over again that's awfull next to that there are some minor bugs that developer is not willing to fix
__label__1 could be good if basic features like icons weren't locked behind a paid subscription update your calling themes an advanced feature because you want to not because it is one sorry but changing the background color to black which it should be in the first place isn't an advanced feature it's about one line of code i'm a software engineer myself and know the difference between the two same goes for icons which are essentially to app functionality check out notion for a great example
__label__2 wish they kept the wunderlist app instead it was perfect some issues i had with this app compared to wunderlist to fix have new items added to the top instead of adding to the bottom or have option to change more quick choice options for the reminder times quick add bar to just type in a search bar box instead of clicking the button have settings apply to all lists so don't have to individually change each list option to add to list on main screen without clicking in list
__label__1 downloaded the app and the server just did not want to connect and synch my to do list and habits gave up after 10 mins
__label__2 have to create an account just to check out functionality don't want to do that uninstalling
__label__2 how to use bakwas i am vrry an gry
__label__5 great app with lots of options and they don't ask for money at every turn but truthfully i am looking for something simple but will definitely recommend
__label__5 just moved from wunderlist transition was easy to do is different in layout but also intuitive works fine on many platforms i wish they have 2 things fixed updated to meet wunderlist feel 1 importance mark the renown star should be entered while typing a task importance mark should also put automatically the task on top of the list 2 'show completed tasks' must be more 'handy' with a button symbol or shortcut not as part of the menu top right 5 stars hope above of a help
__label__5 greatest app i have ever used well thought out organized the only app i can honestly say that i use every single day never forget a thing helps me sleep better at night
__label__3 good simple app and interface well made would prefer a free advert monetization model than sub model i dont plan to pay monthly and free version is somewhat limited for my purposes
__label__4 stuck in lists screen but none of my lists are showing and the only option is to add a new list what am i doing wrong btw i love what i've seen so far being able to add sub tasks under sub tasks awesome 5th star awaits
__label__4 good for saving time
__label__1 this is really annoying i got premium but for some reason it doesn't record how much screentime i've been using and i have to constantly go to accessibility to turn the app on i don't know why it turns off a few minutes i turn it on it's been proven because i use an app called screentime and it records i have used 5 hours but forest doesn't please fix this
__label__3 seems nice i wish there was a way to just do notes and not only tasks also which there was a way to lock certain notes that may be private in case your phone is lost
__label__3 the idea of the app is great but many services are paid the free version is more limited than i thought
__label__5 seems great so far if you add an option to make the widget clear or transparent i'll give you money for premium edit they literally added this for me in less than a week
__label__1 closing and crashing when adding tasks and project support answering but doesn't help
__label__5 great app i'm a heavy hitter when it comes to looking for something wrong with an app and i will be blunt so far no complaints the app runs smoothly there are a lot of great features for the free version what would set this app over the top for me would be the ability to move task to another topic boom hope this review helps you in best way possible let me know what you think
__label__3 this app is well designed but until i can share or delegate individual tasks i won't buy pro or even use the free please add this it needs to sync with google tasks too
__label__1 wint really allow you to use it or even save tasks which disappear you just get bombarded with limitations and stop slgns if you try to use features while having upgrade to premium ads shoved down your throat i don't even know if this app works or not that's how limited it is
__label__4 very useful app gives reminders easy to set up
__label__3 but i miss the hourly blocks made it easy to sceduale my work hours
__label__3 this app is sooo good for and perfect for students add tasks at lightning speed and track your pomodoro sessions habits and tasks without problems
__label__4 good app but not exactly what i was looking for this app uses your calendar events and organizes them in the circle the controls are great i love when i move the red time bar it scrolls through all the things and shows the time changing love the widget i wanted this to work out a homeschool schedule i ended up having to make a new calendar and syncing only that one i was able to change the colors of each event in the app very easy to use overall
__label__2 i liked the app until it told me i could only have 5 goals
__label__1 great app but with a poor 12hr sync to google calendar with no response from the developer in over a year after an immediate response if they cant see this is a problem that is a problem
__label__3 whilst being engaging with its currency system in how you have to work to personalise your experience i do have some quarrels one of these being the similarities in structure between this app and others such as grammarly i understand that this is an advertising matter however it seems to have stolen the feature to double your reward from watching an advert this i find encourages both laziness and the dulling of the experience as it feels repetitive less help would give more work for us
__label__4 it's a good app but has some errors if a close the app a can use every app of my phone for example it will be more fun if one can interactore with the forest play with it or change the form idk
__label__2 it's very confusing i got the calendar app that was suggested to me when i wanted to use the widget but once i started using the calendar along with any do the tasks notifications got duplicated i don't see the point of having any do when the calendar app does the same thing
__label__5 i have tried already few habit trackers and this one is the best so far well done and greetings to argentina
__label__5 i have always been a paper planner girl but now that i've tried artful agenda i will never go back i love the custom covers adorable stickers and the ability to link multiple calendars together in one place it's extremely functional and i am obsessed with the fact that i can access it straight from my phone and computer too no more anxiety about losing my paper planner loving this beautiful digital way to organize
__label__5 excellent with alexa
__label__3 it's good but i don't like how it makes me feel bad for how unproductive i am but that's just me nothing against the program
__label__4 thanks for the response the fact that an event repeats should have nothing to do with the type of notification and i think there should still be a repeating icon if no notification is set it is possible to want an event to repeat without getting an alert also why is the default notification when there is a date all tasks with dates do not require a notification
__label__4 great app only annoying that the mobile and desktop app don't always sync up
__label__2 i thought bc2 was going to be very good for my multiple personal projects it looked well developed and at first its help looked good but i had to abandon it because its help turned out to be useless it never mentioned any issue i needed answered as a learner of the program thus i just could not learn the program the help may be better for other people
__label__3 no tracking time
__label__4 easy to use will continue further and decide if i will get the premium
__label__4 i would like to be able to move multiple tasks as subtasks instead of one at a time that is the only criticism i have the rest is awesome
__label__5 a great supportive tool for google calendar love it
__label__3 this app could be five stars to me what is stopping me is the confusion on knowing just what tasks to do or not to do there's a confusing list of tasks that show up at the bottom and if i did not do them the day before or not click them they just show up there if i delete a task from the calendar on accident what do i do the calendar should be completely removed cuz it's worthless i think tasks should have some sort of streak function or show how many times you have done it in a row
__label__3 the app is great thank you for providing us this gem however we work in several devices we are missing out the multidevice option and for that reason we may migrante elsewhere hope it comes available thx
__label__5 still using the app still happy with it
__label__2 it was ok before now it changes the stuff that i enter please fix
__label__5 very good app it is really soothing and motivating to see trees growing in my forest and there is a suprising variety of plants the free version is already awesome but the cheap premium version is even better planting real trees sound magnificent and the white list function is very important to me suprisingly no disruptive ads are found in both versions definitely recommend it
__label__2 spending 10 once or 5 year for a subscription would make sense to me but paying 15 year to use a to do list when discounted is really excessive this is a great tool actually i love it but i find it ridiculous to pay so much just to temporarily unlock basic features like a calendar edit since writing the above review i've found cheaper free alternatives the one i'm using is called treat yourself it's free and doesn't look great but it serves my needs just right and i love it
__label__4 good app does what you need it to do a little light on instruction or where to find them as i know the app has more functionality but don't know without some digging where to find it also wouldn't mind if the pro version had more features to entice people to buy it or if the free version had a few adds per day for the dev
__label__5 excellent calendar i use it regularly
__label__3 app doesn't have pop up notifications anymore for my tasks that i set a reminder at a certain time for i have checked the app permissions and it allows full notifications
__label__5 this been really working well with me the community is great too it's very useful and the widget is great feature though how about costumizing the app theme like using different color theme instead of the default purple because it will look prettier for my widget d
__label__3 ui needs to be improved
__label__1 it's impossible to use this app at first when i choosed pink theme during onboarding the app ignored my choice then i filled it with all my tasks for two days but when i closed it and opened again the app asked me to sign up with google all my tasks were gone when i did it i m deeply disappointed
__label__1 it's working anymore after paying for premium
__label__3 i have been using this app for years but i am thinking of trying a different app the issue that i have is that doing seemingly simple tasks is overly complicated for example i just want to make a personal and a work task list that is local to my phone doing so has proven very complex and often i will create a task only to realize it has defaulted to my gmail account rather than the local list i intended as a user it's frustrating the reason i use this app is to streamline organization
__label__4 great calendar app easy to use
__label__1 downloaded the app so i could have a widget with my list on my home screen shortly thereafter tney added checkboxes which can't be turned off making it easy to accidentally complete a task on the widget and unlike when you have the app open this can't be undone it was good when i downloaded it but is now completely useless
__label__1 updated and the only thing new is ads deleting after years of use over multiple phones
__label__1 i've used this calendar for years it has always been the best but now they've added ads unless those go away i'll be finding a new calendar
__label__5 this game app is so easy to use and so much fun thank u so much for making habitica
__label__5 creative tool for getting stuff done
__label__3 notification sound does not reflect the do not disturb option
__label__1 those fullscreen ads made me uninstall it after years of using it happily bye won't come back my response or you know i can simply use another calendar app that's free and has no ads
__label__4 great app and the only flaw i see is that you can't yet export your data please make it so you can export data to something like pdf or something so i can save my entries forever
__label__1 can't even use labels for free it's a premium feature uninstalling on principle
__label__3 the time displayed does not automatically update one has to cluck on the widget and enter the app for it to sync with actual time
__label__3 how do you get it to sync with your ms outlook calender what does it mean you detailed it in 8
__label__1 not felt user friendly
__label__1 cannot use without existing calendar
__label__5 this app has changed my life i'd give it 10 stars if i could it helps me manage my day to day tasks by making a list for every day of the week and switching between lists i like that there is a widget available on my pixel phone so that i can see my checklists on my home screen
__label__3 is there anyway to remove the hyperlinks from your description fields
__label__5 works a treat especially useful for planning what i need to do on a daily basis
__label__3 good cool
__label__2 certain of the event doesn't show up in the clock just recorded in my calender
__label__2 when adding a task it transferring you to google calendar then after adding the event it doesn't appear on the widget
__label__2 i really like this app it's one of the best reminder apps there is however the new custom notifications are horrible it sticks out like a sore thumb you have to manually set between white or black background which means that they don't automatically switch with android 10 dark mode they're also not black but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications title and time also don't line up with other notifications plus it says a min ago which is only accurate if i look at my phone immediately and it turns on the screen when the notification comes in even if it's in my pocket this is a great app but the recent update is one of those 'if it ain't broken don't fix it' moments i really hope you consider going back to standard android notifications or at least provide an option between custom or standard i'll gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens
__label__2 only 5 items on free version would be nice to have that clear so i don't have to waste my time and give out my email
__label__3 run time exception can't use the app
__label__5 very versatile and customizable still new to it but it looks very promising if not polished yet
__label__3 i have been using this app for years but i am thinking of trying a different app the issue that i have is that doing seemingly simple tasks is overly complicated for example i just want to make a personal and a work task list that is local to my phone doing so has proven very complex and often i will create a task only to realize it has defaulted to my gmail account rather than the local list i intended as a user it's frustrating the reason i use this app is to streamline organization
__label__3 generally good but has issues adding a subtask is just weird why they can't do what wunderlist does with a place to add or a button and it's all a bit sluggish with some redraw problems but it has some great ideas to it so maybe it'll be good in time
__label__1 i just removed this app i missed several events in the last couple of months because it did not notify me
__label__3 sometimes quits as it starts
__label__4 needs more ranks
__label__2 the tracker itself is not bad but i set up a notification to remind me to do something and am not getting them i already checked my settings all is good it's nice if you remember to go in and mark done but notifications are not working
__label__3 great pomodorro like method for staying on task with a built in reward whitelisting was free at first they should've kept it free and added other desireable features they could've offered at a price
__label__1 doesn't allow you to do a samsung back up and restore
"__label__3 the app is really neat it would be great if there was the option to pause 
timers"
__label__1 yes i started with a 3 star review but i did drop it down to a 1 star review why the developed asked me to send a screenshot of a spontaneous mismatch between what i typed and what the app accepted as my task as per every busy developer he requested for me to email so that he quietly resolves the problem i will not do so he may take off my review but every user be warned you may retype your tasks with this app only for the program to clear it when exitting the edit menu
__label__4 i just need notification tone more than these and much more long
__label__1 the reminders do not work
__label__4 almost perfect the only thing i wish was different is i wish all my lists were available on a main screen that they were clickable from there i don't like that it stays on one list instead of a homescreen instead where all lists available at a quick glance instead of having to go open the tab to see the lists i'd use it a lot more that way
__label__3 not as i required
__label__5 easy to use and quite effective
__label__3 like to check off sub task via widget without opening app checking off task without subtasks works fine wish widget showed calendar wish app had daily weekly monthly yearly trends wish app to sync to google calendar would be nice if you could rearrange the components of a list ex move note below subtasks btw 3 of 5 is to me a strong like you guys are doing a great job
__label__5 turned around my productivity life slowly but surely it's all in how you use it i recommend starting slow with a couple tasks a day that you already do and then slowly adding things you find you need to do clean interface and helpful karma system
__label__1 it wouldn't let me try the app it just told me to subscribe
__label__4 been using for about a year getting more and more useful every day works well across android ipad and windows 10
__label__5 so i love this app i think it's perfect for what i needed at the time sadly my job changed and so did my need for a calendar planner artful agenda was still great but i found myself no longer using the stickers or really having time to add information to it i canceled my subscription they were super easy to work with i still recommend this app to girls when asked i love and miss artful agenda when my job changes again i'll be back
__label__3 interesting organizer but is there any other way to earn gems without buying them
__label__3 i love the concert and it helps me for studies but it works good for a day when i open it on the next day it crashes again and again please fixed it it helps me for studies
__label__3 my friend loves this app but its not for me
__label__4 awesome app love the prize feature i would give 5 stars if these two issues were solved 1 app does not notify me about dailies even though i set a reminder for 7 45am 2 one of my hobbies that can be checked as both positive and negative stays green forever after checking once does not refresh at night is that how its supposed to be
__label__4 good and helpful but the notification alarm does not snoozes automatically the notification stays on the notification bar until not removed pls keep a limit till after which it should snooze
__label__3 i can no longer touch the widget to open the full app what happened i use to be able to touch the upper left hand corner of the widget and the list would open in full screen
__label__4 works as well as wunderlist for the most part for shared lists though i would like to be able to disable notifications it can get annoying when you share a list for grocery items and each deletion is sending a notification
"__label__2 dates and times no such thing here sure you can colorcode and organize and 
sort your tasks to death but strangely enough there's no changing when a 
reminder will go off no setting when a task is due perhaps if you used 
this for work or a meeting or not even the ability to set a due date for 
a task it can be put in the details but when time is of the essence 
you're better off using a better task app"
__label__1 all right so to be clear this app is amazing and i'm really happy to see that someone has made their own version of it even though it's such a great program it became unusable at day one it had bugs and limitations that hindered what i was attempting to accomplish problems such as inaccurate characteristics no quick access from rewards to inventory non removable default achievements inaccurate values on skills after undoing a task and hidden xp multiplier from skills to characteristics
__label__3 reminder is not working what i should do
__label__5 omg just what i've been looking for and you can also have it on a desk top so whenever i'm working and can't reach my phone for booking clients this comes in handy can't wait to see what is coming soon edit i went on the computer to see if there is a major difference and omg there is i totally love the desktop site i cannot wait for more features to come i totally recommend this app to anyone so in love
__label__3 this was a great app for productivity but it was initially difficult to navigate through once i figured it out it still took a bit of time to set up and keep track to if you've used baby of these this interface is beautiful but it takes some time getting used to the input and progress
__label__4 helpful to keep track of to do's and can set reminders at various times
__label__3 still lags on my kitkat version
__label__5 this is a great app to manage schedule interface and otherthings are perfect but i wish that the on screen notification should be like the lock screen popup notification
__label__4 interesting i think not yet try coming here clicking rate and unlock a tree
__label__2 i was about to jump wholeheartedly into using this app its integration with google calendar being exactly what i'm looking for but now i see that it has no search feature on android worse still android search has been on their roadmap since 2015 and it's still not done 2015 in the meantime other apps can build smart lists it out of tags status and free text seriously behind the curve guys
__label__5 just getting started with this app but so far i love it great way to track good habits and bad
__label__5 great and even better for adhd
__label__5 this is the best planing app i could find on the play store it syncs with my google calendar enabling it to be an all inclusive planner but also has lots of personal orginazational abilities i am very impressed with this planner and would recommend it to anyone who likes to be very well planned
__label__5 literally everything that i ever need in a todolist app the minimalistic design and amazing user interface is soo user friendly and helpful to stay organised and plan my days accordingly honestly this has been nothing short of a life changer for me
__label__3 it's really handy for specific dates and categories but i would love it if there were more customising and theme options that are not for the premium package
__label__3 a decent app for its intents and purposes but i struggle to stay invested it's visually good great icons and colours also has a nice selection of skills my biggest issue is the navigation i can't immediately see or twirl down to see subtasks actually marking something as done especially subtasks is a challenge mostly because you face to keep tapping through the task and pages of info to get there perhaps a mind map or something would make it easier
__label__4 this is a great app for anybody needing some extra motivation or a way to organize their life i've had some trouble editing or deleting reoccurring tasks but this may be a device issue i'm not sure
__label__3 a new isdue has cropped up when editing a multiday event that you want to extend 1 more day you must include two additional days in order gor the app to show the one additional day you wish added most strange issue
__label__3 i like that you value privacy so i'm disappointed that tasks within a project can't be broken down into more tasks the comments feature doesn't seem to be enough of a supplement
__label__4 excellent so far i've been using it for several years one thing always is an issue though i can never consistently figure out how to sleep my notifications if they end up on the quick setting drop down menu it seems like it is always wanting to open the event up rather then give me the choice to sleep for various periods of time i use the calendar this way a lot so it is a problem
__label__5 this app is perfect for making my list and helping me stay on task to complete them
__label__3 i'm using the premium version recently it stop updating the total time focused by itself when comparing with other friends
__label__1 useful features ask you to get premium version but when i try i get to this page which is the app i already have installed 1 5
__label__1 very productive app
__label__2 premium version is too much expensive any do should provide an option in which we can select max 3 to 5 apps for integration in premium version pay accordingly
__label__5 pretty much exactly what i was looking for simple and easy to use
__label__4 its a pretty great app with lots of stuff do it actually helps i just love it and use it everyday
__label__5 great simple and useful i wanted a checklist that would function directly from the desktop background of my phone and this works perfectly for that intuitive easy and reliable and nothing more than what i want update a year later still no better task app for a samsung updates only made this app better sublists are easy to organize setting controls very useful i don't use it for reminders b c it doesn't get my attention as well as my phone's alarm
__label__4 great app and easy to use would be great if there was a no date option on notes for like shopping lists ect that aren't just for the day
__label__5 the app is amazing one feature or suggestion i would like to suggest would be to start planting a tree at some given time as set by the user everyday and restrict the user from using other apps opened at the same time and if he still uses other apps he would hv to wither the tree otherwise kudos to your team you people are doing amazing loving it totally
__label__4 not a very userfriendly app but you'll figure it out
__label__3 very pleased practical and clear upset that 1 i paid for and installed an upgrade on my phone but this did not happen on my tablet all i get is advert for upgrade but at extra cost 2 tasks is accessed in 3 steps why not 1
__label__3 first time and first day was everyting amazing but the next day for several time it showed the connection error message i loved everyting in the app very visual and fun so when this issue gets fixed i will come back to give more stars
__label__1 it keeps crashing
__label__2 i granted this app full access to my google calendar but none of my events show up in the diagram it remains completely empty except for national holidays like national tartan day on april 6th yay i've given this two stars instead of one because this could be awesome the design is great
__label__1 expensive old and without any support also much better alternatives are available now
__label__5 the game aspect really does motivate me especially helpful for doing the dishes there's a big difference between i should do xyz and i have to do this or i'll lose health points and i don't want my party to get attacked
__label__5 thop
__label__4 my all around power app this app has been so useful that i use it not just for tasks but also my calendar used to sync with google calendar but left that to be all ticktick now this app is right on the money
__label__3 well done
__label__5 super helpful app i get so invested in making sure my plants don't die and it really helps
__label__3 when i tried to load in my own alarm sound it wouldn't let me
__label__5 good one
__label__4 its ok
__label__4 finally an excellent personal workflow tool from microsoft to do is a great tool for smartphones syncing with outlook tasks and flagged email to deliver a dedicated task management dashboard the my day feature promotes a gtd approach but might be improved by sorting on a numbered list rather than simply on high or normal priority each task can have subtasks but subtasks lack due dates notifications etc projects are not explicitly addressed but can be managed by adding task lists
__label__5 this is an amazing app it has helped me focus so much and even has a real world impact but only if you use pro version i completely understand the need for a pro version without it you wouldn't be able to do the things you do with the app and i wish it wasn't there but that's not my call to make it's an amazing app and i highly recommend
__label__3 it's a great app but i can not depends on it because sometimes it is not working well i have to refresh background task
__label__3 nog that bad
__label__1 worried about the security and having access to email and facebook good way to get hack and information stolen
__label__3 it worked amazing for the first few months and then i decided to go premium after using it for a couple of months i started experiencing problems like it just freezes and doesn't respond please fix it
__label__4 fabulous and simple yet amazing design it has the right tools to organize my time can wait for the new features coming up
__label__1 awful hard to start impossible to figure out
__label__4 overall very good but cant make a task with splitscreen
__label__1 infested with ads now downloaded to specifically view one calendar and set it so but it automatically syncs my samsung and gmail calendars automatically every time i open it
__label__2 the free version was great until now but since they added advertisements to it e g forced to watch an ad after creating an appointment i cannot recommend it anymore it is absolutely annoying the google calendar is the better alternative now
__label__3 waste of time dont download
__label__3 i must say ur reminder doesn't work at all i m not satisfied
__label__5 good for making yourself checklists you can organize activity checklists like you can have a bigger checklists with sublists
__label__3 would give 5 stars but locking the aync function through a subscription sucks
__label__2 very simple design that makes adding a task complex also most useful features are premium
__label__4 good visual representation of my daily schedule and to do list a great way to remain mindful of how time is spent during the day
__label__5 perfect it is brilliant for everything i need i have even thrown away my old to do list notepad
__label__5 must have app
__label__3 hi i have been using this app for a number of years right from the first business calendar app the best feature i like is the management of reminders where the reminders stay on even after the event end time till is dismissed manually however since i have upgraded to s10 the reminders are automatically removed after the end time no change in settings has made any difference unfortunately queries to the support team hasn't helped such a shame update switched to acalendar app which works
__label__4 it is very good app to manage your to do list one thing that can make it better is it should show all the incomplete or overdue taks with todays tasks as overdue instead of into inbox this will make those task more accessible and will keep them under notice
__label__3 ui is hard to understand
__label__3 great app but whin i installed it and tried the basic feature which is the reminder it doesn't avaliable thats mean you cant also try the reminder i appreciate that becouse no one will give you his work as a free ok i will give it less than 4 becouse i didnt see the main feature which i need
__label__2 i'm very sorry i bought the full version so quickly the only benefit i found so far is the ability to add more than 7 habits i couldn't find a report that would provide information about my success and pinpoint areas that i seem to regularly miss i was drawn to the simple ui but will probably write this off as a waste of money and return to daily tasks
__label__5 very great app to keep everything on list and do it with out fail
__label__1 bogus app update isnt working i was using the same app in past in the same device it was working properly now i hv updated and its not giving any notification and even status bar is showing the past activities not current
__label__3 this app used to be helpful now it doesn't give me notifications unless i open the app when i do open the app i am slammed with overlapping reminders i have tried everything in the settings but nothing has helped i like all the other aspects of this app so it's a shame that the one thing i need it for doesn't work any more
__label__4 love the organization so far super easy to use even in comparison to other apps like this would make one change i would like to be able to click on a specific individual time date block on the single day 3 day week calendar set up to add a specific event task to that individual date time block
__label__2 how do i go pro does this app only work with facebook i dont have face book
__label__2 i was going to give 4 stars but the app does something kinda sleazy where it asks you what you would rate it and only redirects you to google play if you said five stars so i lowered it to 2 stars
__label__1 what the hackkkk i tried but it dsnt want get selled its not accpting any option of payment get way i tried debit card upi i love this app and want to purchase it plz resolve it
__label__1 i can't open the app it's showing it's not working
__label__1 programmer does nog work properly it is changing times and dates on his own instead of saving time it is costing me time and money for the pro version i ran into this problem a few days after my purchase so i'm not able to get a refund while the app is unreliable so practically unusuable
__label__3 useless edit thanks for replying i wish the tasks could be repeated every day like in a morning routine that is done everyday to give the user a sense of having a productive morning or something
__label__5 i'm kind of a geek i like planners i used to try out lots of different physical planners then switched to trying out lots of planner apps this is my current favorite i love that it integrates with my calendars and that i can put specific times on my to do tasks if i want makes it so i can look at their calendar view and see all of my meetings and my tasks based on when i'm planning to do them i like being able to quickly schedule tasks snooze tasks schedule recurring tasks etc
__label__5 excellent and detailed beyond average love it
__label__3 no reminder tone else 5 star
__label__3 good could be much better missing the critical feature to sort first alphabetically and then display all incomplete tasks before all complete tasks also should have an option for the tasks in the to do lists to not appear as tasks in outlook exchange
__label__3 excellent concept which has huge potential only problem is that the hour hand does not keep time correctly in 24 hour time it shows 1400 instead of 1600 2 hour difference
__label__1 unable to understand the planner
__label__1 after the latest update the application crashes every time i hit the 'plant' button i have noticed this problem is solved if the internet connection is kept turned on this was excellent app please fix this horrendous bug as soon as possible and i will surely increase my stars
__label__3 the app notification doesn't go away even after ticking the task complete otherwise an amazing app
__label__5 great app for staying on track with several tasks
__label__1 failed to connect to facebook
__label__4 i'm liking it so far it's a very customizable experience and i can really get into the details without the interface being too complex i would like to see more widget options for the ap on the home screen i like to see my schedule and routine the moment i open my phone while there is a widget it's rather lack luster synced with the programming i think it would be cool if they had a calendar widget available
__label__3 it's cool but now i can't use other apps as i used to so i have to delete the app cause i always use many different apps while studying that's sad
__label__2 too confusing not neat
__label__4 helps me keep on track of what needs done
__label__1 the user interface makes no sense
__label__3 unable to edit the day you want to do your habit unless i delete and recreate the habit which means i would lose my past statistics
__label__1 it's useful i wasn't sure how good it'd be at keeping me focused but it really does help and it shows me how much i use my phone also the gardens are quite pretty i would like more realistic varieties of plants and for it to not be so expensive to plant real trees though seems fitting to be able to plant trees in real life with every tree you plant i'd be much more willing to recommend this app to people if i could plant a real tree with every full tree i plant in the app
__label__2 i have read quite a bit about updates being frustrating before applying the update i had hoped to find documentation about changes found nothing on the todoist website no comments in reviews update is attempting to be pushed where's the documentation
__label__2 unable to register via manual and via fb
__label__4 one or two minor hiccups when inserting advance appointments which resulted in a difficulty with getting the diary back to 'todays' date i had to turn the phone on and off in order to correct this also had problems with the app widget failing to download after the phone has been turned on other than those issues the diary has been great i would love to have more options to customise the appearance of the app eg background or page colour options only work when you insert an appointment
__label__1 this app is very very very sexist when you start the app up and go into the icon menu for the avatar of your hero character the vast majority of the icons possibile to select are definitively male worse yet is that all of the ones 'intresting' in thier design or portray something such as the workplace are entirely male the few female icons avalible more than half not even on their own are showing an entirely narrow view with a subservient feeling in thier portrayal the developers of this app should be ashamed of such blatant misogyny
__label__2 why do notes dissapear i pun something today and tomorrow it doesn't show up at all to answer 1 yes 2 local 3 i go in the app month view click on day box write details hour all day save then it shows up in the app and widget for a few hours and then it's gone 4 i have a stable internet connection what should i do
__label__4 its a good calendar definitely bettwr then most and if they keep up ill continue to use it they also are constantly improving the app i'm having difficulties getting it to open on the correct day i'm sure it's just a setting i can't figure out the app keeps opening on a day for days from the current day
__label__3 just started using it i am more use to wunderlist but surely i am going to love using to do and it will be great
__label__1 does not connect with your phone's calendar
__label__3 still getting to grips with the app i'm sure it's great
__label__2 this tune can make alarm i set a few alarm is not ringing
__label__1 i deleted a list but i still get alarms for one of the tasks in that list even after restarting my phone
__label__3 not being able to view my list of things to do or to get
__label__2 really disappointed with the full screen adverts now taking over this otherwise great app will be uninstalling and choosing another alternative app there are plenty big mistake by the developer
__label__3 widget is not working in nova launcher
__label__4 like it
__label__3 it's actually good but it doesn't have a feature where your task appears on your lockscreen that will remind you everytime you forgot something to do
__label__5 i don't know why everyone's complaining that you can't re order tasks and lists drag and drop with a long press works just fine for me at first glance i seem to have finally found a suitable replacement for gtasks
__label__5 perfect hybrid of digital and paper im in love
__label__3 layout and appearance is good but main features like alarm reminder etc are available only in premium version
__label__3 there are much more eady to do list apps this one is not intuitive and no time to waste searching maybe could be interesting after getting used to it
__label__4 why can i see and create task lists from only one account i have 3 google accounts on my phone only one of them are in the tasks list
__label__2 pls give us dark theme cost free so my eyes won't die using this app
__label__3 this app would be perfect if it had a translucent widget but naw it's gotta take up every pixel it can even when i got nothing to do i do recommend it over others though
__label__2 it doesn't work well as a calander or any type of memo for me i also didn't like the type of layout design they made it didn't fit with what the purpose of this app was said to do
__label__3 it was very useful at first helping to focus on things but recently after the new update it looks like the app is crashed suddenly stops working while i'm in the app and not working any more hope you guys fix it soon
__label__1 requires account to use i was just giving a simple reason why i didn't like it but since your response indicates i don't have 10 seconds then i'll waist 5 minutes to make you understand the point is that it requires an account i don't need another stinking account to keep track of a task list if i wanted to share on multiple devices i would just use any number of desktop applications that i already own i don't need another stinking program tracking my business in the sake of backing up my data' or make it available everywhere i have that covered already just wanted a simple task list for a small price to use on my phone but without that choice no thanks to act as though 10 seconds to give up my privacy is no big deal well my information and data is not your business or any one else unless i decide i want to do that that is what you need to understand some customers like to have options to do something and not have something stuffed down their throat downloaded tasks todo list and been happy with it donated 1 99 to developer for making app for me and not their self
__label__5 cool app
__label__2 it's a fine app but logs me out every other time i go to use it
__label__2 was fine until the last couple of days when the layout turned squirrelly on my android tablet seems okay on my smart phone still i will not purchase full version unless the version for my tablet goes back to matching the screen layout on my cell
__label__3 i like the idea how it shows my skills but i hate it when it organize the tasks in orders it sets up automatically wherever it wants manual task organizer should be available
__label__1 update 04 2020 this is getting worse and worse still with every update now they made it harder to edit your task they moved it behind two clicks why seems like this app is moving away from the todo app for power users to just another todo app same as any other this is the last time i paid for the premium subscription time to move it used to be the best for power users but after the latest updates the app keeps getting worse and worse i am not really sure who this updates are for definitely doesn't seem like it's for its core user group
__label__3 the app is good but it has a bug i use poco f1 in desktop widget it many times stop showing tasks just shows a black empty list when we remove it and add it back from widget list it works for some days but problem keeps on occuring times and again please fix it
__label__3 i actually really love this app i used it to create some serious personal progress i purchased the full app but when i bought a new phone it wouldn't let me sign out of my old device and into my new device i emailed support about it crickets never heard from them if they can put together a decent support team i would give the app a 5 for sure
__label__2 almost every feature requires a premium account for 36 per year it's not even possible to test these features without subscribing to an annual plan
__label__4 simple interface clear display not explored advanced features does the job for me
__label__5 i really appreciate the format of this one i just wish i could color code without paying extra
__label__4 i love this app i have the pro version and the layout is very clean and organized however only 4 stars because it does not work on multiple devices
__label__1 want to know that is there any feature like wunderlist app to get notification of comment on all shared members on their app as well as on email
__label__3 one of the billions of to do lists app nothing special unpredictable non intuitive behavior as usual useless hints for features that are obvious i've thrown this app away after the third time when i accidentally removed my task while simply scrolling the list
__label__1 doesn't work offline requires internet and information so not personal as it is over the internet sorry did not get past first screen requiring sign up uninstalled
__label__3 is anything wrong with this app i do have to reinstall the app every day actually it is excellent but i am just about to give up with it i thought that was my phone but it happens only with this app could you guys please check what is going on i do appreciate it thank you thank you for tour reply it jist disappear from my cel regularly and i have to reinstall it again and again i use to move the app from the cel to the sd card i will try to follow your instructions thank you
__label__5 the app has great routine planner helps me keep organized it's important to me for someone with adhd
__label__2 great app to keep focused but too many glitches as you can tell from other reviews for me it has crashed in the passed currently the problem is that the vibration alarm doesn't come on when i'm done my timer so it's literally failing at it's secondary job to keep time of your session 1st job is to keep your phone away from you during your study session because of the glitch i have missed a bus a couple times b c the timer didn't ring i am displeased also the new updates seem unoriginal
__label__1 i cannot imagine how an app managing the same tasks with outlook for desktop is not connecting with it at all you cannot see categories that you set in outlook if you really want a similar to outlook app then see tasks notes
__label__3 is this google calendar tasks and keep if not why pay for a duplicate
__label__3 task management is a bit dangerous can forget to enable a list also can't figure out a way to view a single list without disabling all other lists which ties into first point
__label__2 confusing over complicated and bland looking the fact that i had to go delete the habits that it had already chosen for me made it worse
__label__2 the splash screen says the account is free forever but to have reminder of events tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its 3 per month that's quite misleading response to the developer thank you for responding the main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature best wishes with the app
__label__1 november updates broke a lot of functionalities please fix guys choosing alert notification sounds ability to close off tasks on notification bar lost full purchase info
__label__3 might be good but it doesn't have task library and trying to set everything up myself is not worth it
__label__4 could use more fonts and options and a habit tracker but it's a great start
__label__2 change of days in app is a major problem i wish it would happen smoothly
__label__5 great app
__label__1 please make this app offline as well
__label__4 this app looks great and most of the functions seem to be very practical there isn't any windows or browser based version for usage on a computer is it if not is something in planning as wunderlist will be shut down i'm in search for a good alternative and this app with a sync function would be amazing edit showing the calendar view in a widget would be fantastic as well
__label__1 annoying obstructive ads got fed up after one had a fake x button that was designed to trick you into tapping on it
__label__5 it's a delightful app that helps you keep on top of things personally i've found that you get as much as you put into it there are communities and challenges you can join with like minded people to help you achieve similar goals and their are seasonal events as well there are no adds no constant pop ups to buy gems and all features are equally helpful without the gems
__label__2 disappointed that you can't share lists across organizations doesn't help when you trying to keep track of tasks and collobrations to do lists with people in other companies
__label__4 amazing app some glitchy moments but overall nothing too annoying this app is so cool that i'm ok with some glitches because in a very short time its already brought so much value to my life brilliant idea to get you into good habits and out of bad ones in my experience it actually works
__label__1 decent but premium features like sync do not work can't even reimport data you exported yourself had i realized this i would have never have bought the app it's just false advertising i now have to figure out how to port my data to another app where it won't be inevitably lost
__label__1 app is good but very few options in free version you guys shouldn't label the app as free wasted my time trying this app
__label__1 i don't mind ads but not those which run in full screen mode and cannot be closed by me
__label__4 please add two options 1 tag or label in task and list 2 password to enter application thanks for free
__label__4 it works well for me
__label__2 i liked wunderlist much more i can't arrange the tasks in the list freely it looks like there is something wrong because i can arrange some lists and couldn't for others and the starred list which is switched to important is just a long list i liked how it was divided before it is really disappointing
__label__3 layout and appearance is good but main features like alarm reminder etc are available only in premium version
__label__5 cool app i use it everyday
__label__1 path profile name is required glitch when trying to make avatar on galaxy s10
__label__3 tried this app for a bit the logic is very different from what i need so the experience wasn't good this app focuses on routines and is built around this concept it was very confusing at first because it started with abstract ideas not what average joe is already familiar with e g calendar timeline and the entire experience just felt awkward for me all i want is see the day week month add to do items one by one and be able to turn any of these items into routines when i want to
__label__2 the new update is awful i have to do so many extra clicks to perform basic operations like moving tasks to different days multi select doesn't work any more and the widget is totally broken rescheduling anything from the widget locks it up completely
__label__3 please fix app cannot refresh once again for the second time topics pic quote
__label__2 none of the notifications work other people in the forums teport similar problems bht no fix the app is nice but it isnt nearly as functional without notifications
__label__1 app is awesome but in this no login facility and assign task
__label__1 too complicated
__label__5 very exciting app very helpful for my daily or weekly shedule
__label__3 great app when it works but don't assume you will get any support when it doesn't always read our help files and that is it
__label__4 this app is great to organize your day or make shopping lists etc but sadly i don't get notifications even if i turned them on i hope this will be fixed soon
__label__1 the app keeps crashing i paid for the pro version but the problem hasn't resolved
__label__3 clear and easy to use but doesn't sync well between pc and phone
__label__4 the calendar reminders can be very shotty but the overall app is very useful
__label__5 i love the fact this integrates with whatsapp i use it for work and personal it make thing so much easier
__label__1 this provider will spam your email box with no option to unsubscribe beware
__label__3 still frustratingly basic compared to todoist i'd love to move over and consolidate within the microsoft ecosystem but there's still so many quality of life areas that are lacking in to do can i suggest starting with natural language support for setting up tasks though it makes it so much quicker to use
__label__2 it works does what it's supposed to do although i don't require any features other than setting an appointment event and being reminded of it unobtrusive even when using it as a free version only i'll probably upgrade to pro just to reward the developer edit the new 30 second ads really screw this up
__label__3 the app is amazing but my leave the app feature is not working cause i want whenever i leave the app the tree should wither but that's not happening help
__label__3 it's listing the same tasks after some time even after its checked and completed in short it's listing the status of tasks
__label__3 i'm trying to add a task press add button the arrow and the task just disappeares quite simple functionality and even this with bugs
__label__4 i am just beginning to use this app but it appears to have everything i need
__label__2 i'm changing my rating from 5 to 2 i've used this app for many years and i love it it's a great app but they have recently added add on videos skippable but still 5 seconds long after you've created or closed an event in your calendar app it's really annoying and disgusting because you don't have time watching adds when you want to add a couple of events everyday in you schedule you've went to far business calendar 2
__label__5 i love this app the pro version helps me stay focused no matter where i go
__label__5 very good it almost obligates you to complete yours habits
__label__5 simple and easy to use help and remind me day to day task
__label__2 this app worked well at first but it kept altering my entries no matter how many times i changed them not sure if it's a problem just with syncing accounts
__label__4 good application its better if synchronisation time can be improved
__label__4 nice app but almost everything from the menu needs a premium verson to use it at least keep the friends section as a free section so people will get other people involved in this
__label__3 i bought the allegedly better version it worked for about a month i had all my scheduled stuff about 6 months and all of a sudden the disappeared which sucks
__label__1 nnuj
__label__2 i liked it but most of intresting features was unable until you purchase them
__label__2 acceptable
__label__1 hey todoist why are you todoing this to me first you put these silly little checkmarks on my tasks that are 100 in my way leftys are people too i keep unintentionally deleting tasks and having to dig through my completed items to restore them that's annoying now this latest update you've taken away subgroups subgroups are part of the entire project having an overall view of all subs within a group is convenient having to flip from sub to sub is illogical i just don't get it
__label__3 widget doesn't work
__label__5 loved it awesome for making habbits best app for monitering ur tasks and daily routine thanks habitnow
__label__2 sync no longer works also app has been buggy lately closes down and does not respond i'm now using loop habit tracker which is more stable
__label__4 wish it supported sharing but otherwise a fantastic simple to do list app
__label__4 i very much enjoy this app it has helped me greatly and its easy and fun to use there is one issue though i do not enjoy having an app call me affectionate names such as darling and sunshine quite frankly it makes my stomach turn everytime this happens i like this app so much i bought the premium version but the fact that the app was calling me pet names made me almost delete it i plan on continuing to use habitbull but i sincerely hope this weird occurrence is changed
__label__5 beautiful app
__label__4 ever since i downloaded this app i've gotten less lazy i've done more work and i was able to keep track of my tasks needed i would rate 5 5 stars but i would like this app to have compatibility on windows or have some sort of chrome extension if i am mistaken and there is a windows chrome extension please notify me thank you
__label__1 my tree dies without me leaving the app ever since the new update
__label__3 does not support advanced repetition like every last friday
__label__1 an app absolutely focused on my needs that has broken the sync function broke down about 3 or 4 months ago it can export its data to csv but not import it
__label__4 is 4 enough
__label__1 not worth 38
__label__2 downloaded a bunch of these types of programs to find the one that was best this was one of the worst played with it for about an hour and couldnt figure it out
__label__3 after it was updated i can't open this app it don't work and i have to reinstall it because i still love this app but that isn't comfortable hope you guys can fix it
__label__5 i like this app i downloaded a few to have a look and pick one and i went with this one i like the lay out and i just find it easy to follow l
__label__4 i've tried quite a few rpg like to do list apps and i must say this one is the only one that i find genuinely enjoyable and actually kinda feels like a game you can tell a lot of effort was put into the aesthetic everything is very easy to access and is pleasing to the eye although i think there should be a way to uncheck to do's i keep accidentally clicking on them in the widget and remaking them every time is starting to get annoying
__label__3 ehh it's just way too confusing for me to understand and do anything my health would probably go to 0 if i actually did know what i was doing anyways lmao
__label__5 very useful for keeping myself accountable for daily tasks and goals that i want to accomplish
__label__3 really like the account switch function really smooth but as a wunderlist user i really wish i have option to change back to old interface wish for more flexibility on the menu especially that my day fuction quite annoying that is the function i used least but showed on top of everything and can't hide it
__label__2 best to do list app except the new notifications have gone haywire they only pop up at bottom of screen and then disappear if i open any other app old standard android notifications would remain in pull down notification drawer until i dealt with it far superior please bring that back
__label__1 edit i'm using this application many year since release and i'm loved it and donate now you make this application subscription 15 a year really not happy with that
__label__1 very bad app not able to close my account they are forcefully charging amount
__label__4 i like this app but it really annoys me that it defaults to playing a chime when you first pick up your phone in the morning when just checking the time i don't want to be woken up even more i wish it were possible to just disable that notification instead of disabling all sounds from the app at once
__label__3 i purchased the pro version there was an update and now the pro version is gone i cannot seam to get it back and i have written thru the feedback link with no response the pro version purchase shows in my play folder but i cannot get the pro version loaded i uninstalled and reinstalled and still no help need to get the pro version loaded again please help
__label__2 the features are good but unfair to pay on yearly basis
__label__2 it doesn't allow the ability to automatically set reminders when creating a new event i use both the google calendar app and business cal pro and they both allow the ability to automatically set reminders and yes i have this setting enabled in my google calendar web settings this is an important feature that's missing
__label__4 não tem a opçāo de sub tarefa
__label__3 ni
__label__3 یاشار
__label__3 great app it will be the best app if developers add an ability to make schedule of pomodoro goals 10 on monday but 5 on tuesday for example
__label__2 the free version was great until now but since they added advertisements to it e g forced to watch an ad after creating an appointment i cannot recommend it anymore it is absolutely annoying the google calendar is the better alternative now
__label__3 good function weird execution the program works great but it has weird way of reminding the user of the habit like saying hey tiger its just weird
__label__4 the calendar widget cannot follow up with today date it just fixed at the date that created the widget only hopefully can fix this problem
__label__1 unskippable video ads pop up when you are adding or editing an event i mean video ads popping up in a calendar app is bush league already but unskippable may as well have a boxing glove on a spring pop out of my phone and smash my groin that's probably preferable
__label__4 i'm just starting out with habitica and am liking it so far but the to dos would be much more useful if they could be organized by due date i've got like 25 things on that list with due dates over the next two weeks or so and it would be much easier to actually accomplish these things if i could easily see which were the most urgent instead of having to scroll up and down and compare dates in a mental tally
__label__3 premium for calendar views seriously
__label__5 tick tick has been very easy to use and very handy i use it for both business and personal use and find it very easy to collaborate lists with other people and create lists
__label__3 this just displays your calendar as a time sector whenever you click on it redirects to calendar
__label__5 for someone who does this on the side the developer is the most responsive i've ever seen i've tried at least 6 other popular list apps and this one is my favorite it does the best job of laying out lists and sublists that i could find
__label__1 when i set a task for repeat for a specific day of the week the app still doesn't repeat the task i have to set everything manually
__label__4 great at 1st
__label__1 downloaded this app hoping for a fun way to form new habits but when i get to the register screen the first two tutorial panels are blank and then the third one lets you link social media accounts then i can't save the username and display name i create and the avatar generator screen doesn't load any options opened the app the next day to find nothing i could edit had been saved uninstalled and tried registering again with a different account and got the same results pretty disappointed
__label__3 nice looking app though no google sync
__label__2 missing everything good about gtasks and adds everything you hate about every other task list app
__label__2 it does not give me the ability to not use 24 hr time format i'm not in the military or a factory so i prefer regular time format doesn't matter how many times i uncheck the 24 hr setting it sticks fix that and i'll rate higher and maybe even purchase a yr subscription
__label__4 only the first event added to the calendar gets synced to the sectograph app instantly all other events takes quite a while to be synced to the app clicking manual update or relaunching the app doesn't solve the issue
__label__3 it has almost everything that i need but the thing that frustrates me the most is the calendar view that's really the most important thing to see how many days you've tracked in a row switch to calendar view it looks just like a regular calendar and nothing is highlighted for anything you have to click on each individual day to see what it looks like
__label__3 ok ilv
__label__3 it hard to use
__label__2 no custom repeat frequency
__label__4 so far the best planner app i ever come across room for improvement i e to be accessible on pc as if some other app does
__label__5 this has replaced my paper planner and i am addicted to it the most amazing app and product ever
__label__1 so it's just a demo to see if you would like to purchase the app it says it does this so you can learn how to use the app but it doesn't allow you to do anything because none of my info or calenders can be added to it because it's just a demo so it's really hard to tell if i like something if i can't do anything on it something to think about if you actually want to make money selling an app just saying thanks for wasting my time while i'm trying to save time
__label__1 doesn't show character customisation think it needs an update
__label__4 couldn't create my avatar at first but after that it worked fine
__label__1 app starts ads after 1 month and opens wanting paid every time after the first month
__label__5 thank you microsoft due this great app i wish the feedback section is more active
__label__3 it's decent but the google tasks integration is bad it's set to hourly sync but doesn't actually update tasks unless i manually trigger it the repeating tasks data is not synced with google if it's due to repeat in bc but i tick it off on a google webpage then it's gone no repeat i'm also having a problem with notifications appearing later than they should all in all i'm going back to google calendar
__label__4 not bad it's a basic to do list which establishes days when a project is to be completed and a list of tasks that were uncompleted uncomplicated and useful i would like to see the option that shows a job partially completed some projects need to be held over and a more customisable repeat process every fortnight or third friday of the week
__label__3 i wish it would sync so i could use it on all devices
__label__3 doesn't work with wear os
__label__1 since you have put advertisements in app i say goodbye on top of that an update came up and isn't possible to view description of booked day unless you click on it disappointed
__label__3 i really enjoyed the experience of using this app i like it but it doesn't work offline so i can't use it properly so please make it offline or at least se fundamental features
__label__3 this took quite a bit of setting up but now it is working again i like this calendar
__label__2 all the professional options i need alerts as alarms is really helpful for people who get desensitized from too many notifications update alerts as alarms suddenly stopped working i am missing appointments
__label__3 i'd love to see class selection as an option when you start the game i was forced to be warrior without an option to change i even went to setting and nothing there to change it either
__label__5 it would be great if we could push the scheduled events to put them later or sooner
__label__5 this app is incredibly helpful i need to take medication every morning and this app helps me make sure i take the tablet it helps me build the habit of taking it
__label__1 want use only not sharing
__label__2 this app is inferior to wunderlist as of now it needs to be an option to duplicate a list exactly and rename it you should also be able to attach pictures and instructions to long lists that you've made it's just not nearly as intuitive as wunderlist i have 50 locations that often need all the same services performed and it is a major waste of time to type can01 can02 can03 can04 etc every time i have a sweeping maintenance issue
__label__5 simple straightforward app
__label__3 ok but i hate big full screen ads with long videos
__label__3 i found this app to be redundant since i already have a calendar on my phone and planner pro does little else
__label__4 it is what i have looked for for some time i wish it could sync'd across multiple devices
__label__3 i really have wanted this app to work i'd really prefer to see my day filled on a clock in such a way so i even came back to try again however i'm having trouble putting tasks in after a certain amount they stop saving i'm also struggling to see the clock in a way that makes sense it looks very jumbled best of luck i love the concept
__label__4 i really liked this app however i have downloaded it yesterday and created tasks which repeats daily but it always shows tasks date 30 march it was just the date i created it it repeats daily so the dates should change too it feels as if i am checking undone tasks from the past even in the calander view these tasks are not added to 31 march it's annoying me please do something about it
__label__3 is the feature of different colours for different tasks available for the free version too i m actually not able to set it that way no sir i did the way u told me to do it is still not showing different colours
__label__2 keeps clossing
__label__5 has been using this app since last 7 months and everything goes better thank you so much really worth downloading it
__label__4 love this app so far it just needs push notifications widgets and a habit tracker hut all in due time i'm sure
__label__5 awesome app
__label__4 good app but everytime for particular thing should go inside every remainder and check other than that beneficial app very good will recommend this
__label__3 its pretty neat but the feedback on the paid app is pretty poor
__label__5 good
__label__5 this app is too good it is helping me and futher it will to be staying focused at a particular thing for a particular period of time
__label__3 cool layout very easy push notifications aren't working so it doesn't remind me at the time i tell it too but can't figure why i allowed notifications so probably a bug
__label__5 very useful
__label__4 treating activities like a game gives me a sense of accomplishment when i successfully finish my duties and earn xp
__label__4 i like this app you think that the hours spent in class and the potential to acquire a college degree would be enough but it is not only the idea of growing a virtual forest will keep me off my damn phone
__label__4 i been looking for such an app and finally found it it's really nice and i can keep a record of my activities on daily basis
__label__2 keep getting a pop up re authorisation failed even though my google account is already authorised on my account
__label__3 it 's good
__label__1 enough with the pop up ads i don't mind if an app has ads but if i'm going to be interrupted by a 15 second video every 5 seconds while i'm checking off my list i'm deleting your app and no i'm not going to subscribe just because you keep popping up the subscription page if i have to pay to make the app decently usable you may as well require i pay for it to begin with
__label__3 app is awesome n also helps alot but its inbuilt password once forgot don't opens the app evertime i need to log out and again log in it plz solve my issue
__label__5 amazing productivity booster
__label__5 easy to list things and good reminder
__label__4 easy useful app that connects all my platforms makes connecting in the business a breeze
__label__1 i have used this app for years i have always paid for the premium version at first it was my favorite app but it has gotten steadily worse now it is very glitchy it closes randomly and typically takes up to three minutes to open which is very embarrassing when i'm trying to set an appointment with a customer it also randomly unchecks completed tasks and reverts to older versions of my schedule the developers are uncaring and blame my phone note 8 i'm looking for a new app
__label__3 looks a lot like todoist i said look because todoist is bug free when compared to this one what a waste of time i had trying to set it up both by natural language and clicking
__label__4 i love the white noise feature it helps me stay focused on the task at hand
__label__4 the app keeps crashing whenever i don't use the app for a few days i have to uninstall and then install again for it to work normally
__label__3 awesome idea five plus in advance although turns out there are more appealing apps interface wise but non the less it is all about insides not the outside
__label__3 sharing lists doesn't work nearly as well as it did in wunderlist otherwise ok
__label__3 the reviews are sending a clear message to you act on them i think the last update has messed everyone up if you don't act you're sending a message back ie you meant to mess everyone up by locking them out
__label__3 would be better if it was possible to add to the top of the list it is not easy to use with one hand since everything is in the top left corner lists do not automatically sort and sort needs to be done again if anything is changed
__label__4 i only started using it yesterday and so far it is interesting and i think it will be useful i'd give it 4 5 stars but that isn't an option so 4 it is for now i'd really like to see a better way to organize dailies preferably alphabetically so tasks i tag as morning will show up before night though admittedly that wouldn't help if i labeled any 'afternoon' or 'noon'
__label__4 amazing app keeps me off my phone when i need to be productive but it's been having some glitches lately i've been trying to open it and it just opens itself and closes again it only works if i uninstall it and then install it again hope to see this issue fixed
__label__3 it is an ok app as far as personal entries are concerned and the connected functions of name time and place can not count on it to keep you informed about set calender events though as they are set default in 2014 mothers day was on the 8th 2nd sunday in may this year not wednesday the 11th they can thank my wife for keeping me informed it is a scheduling app and if the default events are wrong as well as uneditable how confusing will your scheduling be keep an accurate calendar handy
__label__3 could be easier to set up and save notes was confusing at first but a good app
__label__1 i was looking forward to using this app but it wont even let me pick out an avatar things just go blank on the app and tells me i'm missing information when i clearly am not what a bummer
__label__3 why do not work reminders repeated monthly at all one time yes repeated no what is wrong
__label__2 can't clean up old alexa lists we use this purely for the alexa shopping list integration however early on it was very buggy so we had to relink our alexa account a number of times and now we have like 4 or 5 old alexa shopping list s that we cannot delete alexa lists can not be modified with any do you can do it from the alexa app no i can not because it only deletes the working one
__label__1 doesn't even have a basic dark mode without pro
__label__1 be aware of irrecoverable deletions worked fine until i accidentally erased some important data i had been gathering for a few years guess what there is no undo no way to recover anything had i known that i'd never use this pos ticktick if you want to have cool and modern features like google auto save in particular you must back it up with a fricken version control feature otherwise just go back 100 years to are you sure you want to save delete confirmation dialogues
__label__1 doesn't sync to calendar
__label__4 long time user of this app problem is it doesn't have a search feature or if it does i can't find it sometimes i forget where i filed my note or task again longtime user and then it takes me a while to go through all my files to figure out which title heading i put it under but if it had a search feature i could quickly find it and get back to being productive for this reason i gave it 4 stars because it has room for improvement
__label__4 powerful app great features
__label__3 overall great organization tool however recent updates make the application only usable in horizontal view which is extremely annoying and quite an inconvenience
__label__2 hard to use
__label__3 the app has been great on desktop and decent on the phone performance of the android app is noticeably worse than ios though especially on start up
__label__4 works well except it keeps asking to change the timezone when i switch to firefox
__label__3 this app is great but please add the copy list feature on android too and also uncheck all feature so i can reuse a routine list without uncheking all one by one
__label__3 i haven't been using this very long and it's not as user friendly as the calender that came on my last phone i wish instead of dots you can just see what you have entered for that day immediately without tapping on that day otherwise it is easy to use and functional
__label__3 it doesn't ring or do any sign to remind me about my work
__label__5 super easy to use and very addictive strongly recommend to anyone looking for a uncomplicated and easy tinuse to do app
__label__4 i have reminder set for every weekday morning at a certain time hasn't reminded me at the right time yet always hours after i get it
__label__1 this app is amazing but now it just keeeeeps crashing idk why i tried reinstalling it but it didnt work please fix this
__label__1 app worked fine till they put in the new username update now there's a bug where you can't get into the app because every name is taken
__label__5 really great it takes some time to get it working my current use is to input what i plan to do the previous day either at night or through the day when i discover what needs to be done jotting down your plans is more effective than you might think to productivity ill keep using it and get back when i discover more tips to be more productive
__label__4 good app
__label__2 the whole app is pretty broke on the note 9 edit i would love to report the big to help however the settings menue does not work so i do not have the ability to send a report
__label__5 has literally changed my life i use it for everyday tasks and chores my husband and i literally no longer argue about what needs to be done around the house i also use it as a grocery list as well so my husband and i can add things to it and when we go to the grocery store we just swipe of that we got it absolutely life changing
__label__4 liking it a lot so far but i don't get it doesn't give a warning ring before tasks i put in that's kind of the main thing i need it for to remind me of tasks i had previously put in
__label__4 love the way it can be easily zoomed for both size and number of days
__label__4 its good for time management
__label__4 i run multiple businesses and so far this has helped me organize my days tremendously a lot of initial decisions had to be made about where i want things and that took a while but now i'm really glad i took the time to do it because it's all coming together and actually relieving some stress hopefully i can come back and add the 5th star after i've had more time using it
__label__1 this is good app
__label__3 paid dark theme im going behind another app
__label__3 how to view the app on laptop just like wunderlist
__label__3 just upgraded to premium version app and google play list subscription at 27 99 i got charged 29 84
__label__4 wanted vertical and horizontal in routines like before and not to display that alarm clock thank you for your feedback i love it
__label__5 pretty useful
__label__5 i've never been so pleased with an app like this it designed well easy to navigate and keeps me motivated to improve my life
__label__5 this app is a simple an elegant solution for tracking habits it offers widgets as well as a nice simple interface for getting habits done i guess if i had to complain i think i had an issue where if there was a task set to be complete x days a week it would not go away on the widget ever even if you had done the task the required amount of times a week could have been my mistake however otherwise great
__label__3 does it not have feature to set reminder daily weekly monthly and yearly
__label__5 beautiful ui ux design very easy to navigate and the developers keep adding useful features if you're looking for an app with a to do list feature and a pomodoro timer ticktick is a great choice i don't use the premium version and so far i've still been able to access a lot of features i highly recommend this app
__label__3 pretty but useless as the display is picking up calender events and putting them a day late
__label__3 too many items
__label__3 good
__label__3 the new notifications in 5 3 suck they visually look wrong don't perform well and are a huge step backwards would love to see a reversion to the system notifications rather than custom
__label__5 this app is great for helping to establish new habits and keep you on track with goals and tasks you want to accomplish
__label__5 very cool way to show your schedule on a day
__label__3 fine app but i'm getting really tired of being forced to use a microsoft account everywhere
__label__5 very efficient app a real time saver and since the last update a new widget extremely well made and customizable you don't even need to actually open the app
__label__5 i just wish it wasnt a subsciption and i could just buy it once otherwise its professional app and i love how it lets you customize rewards always wondered what my life as an rpg game would be like and do it now lets that happen
__label__3 no japanese support
__label__3 tasks dont show up in google cal and you cant schedule a certain amount of time for each task
__label__3 i recently downloaded this app and paid for the premium subscription i like the app but i have two issues that are hindering its functionality the first is that the notifications slate quite buggy i have 3 different daily tasks which i've set to notify me when they start and i only receive my notifications sometimes the second is that my workweek is sunday thursday and i found out after speaking with their support that there is no option to set a non standard workweek
__label__4 hey guys the new update messed up the widget layout for me now everything is smaller and more difficult to read
__label__2 edit been using it for a while occasionally and every time it feels like a hassle to find what i need to reach within the app i only use the routines no events or reminders i have a separate app for that google assistant wit a calendar to add a change to one day it requires a lot of clicking to amend it i end up writing down the rest of the day tasks on paper deleting amending the times and adding them manually with the new times that's counterproductive i need an easy way to move
__label__4 hello this app is great but i have a suggestion with the inventory items please make it so you can give them attribites such as 10 xp gain or 10 gold gain or just 10 xp for a specific skill
__label__1 can not cancel subscription
__label__1 i was not planning to give a review but it left me no choice since its replacing wunderlist which is very useful app which my wife and i love especially for our grocery lists now this to do tries to replace it but can't even get it to work properly if i can give zero star i would
__label__1 app not downloading on my oneplus7 pro tried to restart my phone even then
__label__1 it just doesn't work my family used wunderlist for years ms bought them this app won't sync between users tells me i'm offline i'm not and lost my existing lists i'm going elsewhere
__label__3 works well for me and does its jobs and i never forget stuff anymore well done guys and thank you for this app jannov
__label__2 seems to have glitched out on me when i put in my username and display name it gave me an error saying path profile name required then none of the avatar customization options appeared i wasn't even able to start the third page when the app crashed reopening the app took me to the dailies tutorial and now i'm sure i'm missing something i have a samsung galaxy note 10
__label__3 there are functions available that i can't find out how it works i e assign to me otherwise just what i needed
__label__2 paid widget feature one thing that downplays all other
__label__4 good app looses my long term appointments now and then
__label__3 good app minus one star because of the constant nagging and that's in the paid version
__label__5 the app is great but i cannot purchase premium version it says that cannot connect to internet and my internet is working so i cannot use all advantages of this app unfortunately
__label__5 this app is very useful minimalist yet almost everything is available i could group my activities sub activities and tasks as per my wish and use them to plan accordingly a calendar option would make it complete
__label__5 keeps everything organized between my wife and me now she can even tell me what to do when im not home really though keeps us totally coordinated and stops us wasting time live ut for my own lists too i live by lists so this is a dream come true
__label__3 easy to use simple functionality but well done
__label__2 recurring tasks are very glitchy they sometimes change the day or time when they recur per any do's request i sent them a video of this happening crickets no explanation or acknowledgement and no refund as i requested fine otherwise but i rely on recurring items
__label__5 super
__label__1 pay to remind really
__label__1 i cannt acces my account anymore since their password reset feature does not work tried on my iphone android oreo web version i don't receive any email to reset my password
__label__5 very easy to use helps me to not miss things that aging was making me forget
__label__4 amazing app helps me organise different tasks and events with colour codes wish there was a notes page and a timetable so i could keep everything in one place
__label__1 this app just isnt for me
__label__3 are there any guides out there
__label__4 good experience it's very easy and helpful
__label__5 the app does wonders
__label__3 widget does not update itself shows up empty and had to replace everytime refresh doesn't work on latest app and os
__label__4 lol i went to settings change character value and got myself 9m coins uwu btw is that cheating i mean well its right there
__label__4 newly installed re resolutions seems to be a bug on android when i set a target date it sets it to the day after if i go back in and change it back one day it keeps it please fix seems like a great app purchased to export data because data is beautiful lol thank you
__label__5 love this app to stay off my phone while working it really helps in only using the phone if it's really necessary it's super motivating to watch your forest grow
__label__2 i just installed this app and it's always on landscape view please fix this soon thank you
__label__4 perfect for my needs i just wish it was also for apple so i can use it across many platforms
__label__1 the fact that you have to pay so much to use something so simple isn't worth it to me there are free apps of similar functionality
__label__5 if you're really serious with creating and tracking new habits within your life then this app will be very good for you
__label__1 i can't activate notification for complete focus time
__label__4 so far so good
__label__3 i got a newer phone and i used the same email that i purchased the pro app on but it won't let me install it again for free when i've already paid for it
__label__2 recurence tasks does not work properly otherwise i would give 4 starts
__label__4 excellent app great habit tracker i've found in this app an exciting way to be productive there are some bugs and functionalities that need to be fixed however it's worth using it i really recommend it
__label__4 it would be nice if there are pre set goals or task to choose from while the app allow for a high level of customization it's too much hassle to set it all up properly not to mention balancing the reward from each task
__label__2 without syncing to the cloud this todo app is unfortunately worthless love it otherwise and would have given it 4 or 5 stars please add sync since in my quest to find a good todo app this is the only one i've seen that doesn't sync anywhere between devices
__label__3 ça fait le job sans plus l'ergonomie n'est pas des plus brillante
__label__4 i love the different colour options
__label__3 the setup seemed nice but the constant pop ups are so annoying as to make it unusable
__label__1 app starts ads after 1 month and opens wanting paid every time after the first month
__label__5 awesome
__label__3 i didn't like the way the lists would set up
__label__3 after the recent update displays alarms an hour earlier than they actually are been using the app for more than a year now and love it
__label__3 it show the full day events on next day actual which is incorrect otherwise it's good there should be option for alert tone
__label__4 it would be better if we can insert pictures in the tasks but all in all it was cute and helpful
__label__3 this app refuses to let you set a reminder for any day other than the current day without buying premium i want to remind myself to workout every wednesday but it's monday so i'm only allowed to schedule reminders on monday guess i'll just get reminded on monday to workout on wednesday useless
__label__4 amazing almost perfect
__label__5 fantastic it saves my life
__label__3 this app is pretty good and works well but i was wondering if you could make the designing as well as the app on the web
__label__2 edit even just an option for the horizontal interface would be great thank you for taking my review into consideration please please please bring back the old horizontal interface or at least have an option for it i used to absolutely love this app and would have rated it 5 stars anyday but now i find it quite useless i understand how it could work for some people but it's definitely not working for everyone as i've seen in other reviews
__label__4 how do i push back and or bump up a daily routine edit they answered my issue other than needing an easier way to do what i mentioned above i love this app very easy to use and very started i love that you can create your own tags too
__label__5 outstanding i have relied on this app for years the customization of the design colours for the calendar widget is a massive pro as it keeps with my phone's aesthetics the learning curve is a little steep in some cases but the capabilities and look are worth it with multiple reminder notifications ability to include emojis different colour options for calendar entries and design layout much more this is an indispensable app in my arsenal added colour options would be my one request
__label__1 i love all the recent changes you have made especially the ability to undo things in the history could you please add an option to manually reorder tasks i would like to put mine in the order that i do them throughout the day and none of your sorting allows that thanks update it's been 22 months since you said you'd make drag and drop sorting an option i see monthly updates but not the one feature that would make this app user friendly don't promise what you won't deliver
__label__5 great for productivity if you use it right you really need to respect the timer if you want it to actually work 4 stars because i'd like to see room breaks implemente since right now you have to do your own break and restart the room
__label__5 just does everything it should allows you to configure alot but all the defaults are good syncs across many platforms and allows you to email tasks much better than todoist and feels like wunderlist on steroids
__label__5 it is not an exaggeration to say that the colorful customizable syncable endlessly useful ticktick has changed my workflow productivity life there are some improvements i've hoped they'd make the ability to determine an est amt of time for a task aside from pomodoro calendar including a habit tracker in the computer software in addition to the phone but it's 5 stars even with those elements lacking and that's why i am a loyal customer who has recommended it to everyone i know
__label__5 this is by far the best overall organizer app i have found my only complaint would be the lack of multi tiered tasks
__label__3 the app itself is a wonderful idea but the interface and functions need a lot of work in my opinion it took me so long to figure out how to set up a habit and i still don't understand how to use a task groups or steps i gave up and came back to my previous tracker because it was too complicated and time consuming to learn how to use this one anyway i will definitely retry after an update
__label__1 app is no longer functional cant even start app without it malfunctioning cant change username or character it was fine before the update
__label__5 i have been using artful agenda on a desktop this year and love all it's features now the app makes it even more accessible i love planning meals and mapping out my day
__label__4 only had a couple of days and generally good experience ties in nicely with google assistant though i cant get it to automatically set a time to remind on a task when created by voice slight niggle that when i do certain actions completing events the app jumps to mid july on the calendar no clue why but it's pretty irritating overall seems to be helpful for productivity
__label__4 so far so good
__label__3 hi the range of the nuce coloured sectors does not cover the time interval of my events it had been the best reason why i chose this app to have an easy straightforward overview of my plans why doesn't ut work as it is shown on the pictures
__label__4 it is a fantastic apps but if they can allow the push reminder in the free version it will make it perfect
__label__1 no matter what settings i choose i get no sound when timer is up app would be great if i could hear when timer is up it makes sound when going through menu sent an email over a week ago all these months later and still same issues
__label__1 love this calendar up until a few days ago the ads used to be fairly non intrusive which i get and could totally live with now they have a full screen animation that you have to wait on to use the calendar totally unacceptable when i'm with a customer absolutely do not recommended this calendar as currently configured
__label__3 i like it but when i put my pass code in to access it i goes through but then it says your password has been changed please sign in but i have to hit the back button on my phone to ignore it so it doesn't make me sign in again but when i do hit ok for it to let me sign in again my password isn't there it's still locked but i don't know the password
__label__3 the reviews are sending a clear message to you act on them i think the last update has messed everyone up if you don't act you're sending a message back ie you meant to mess everyone up by locking them out
__label__2 questionable experience upgraded to premium but whatsapp integration is not working seems a little confusing
"__label__3 could you make it offline for while i dont like being forced to be online 
all the time"
__label__1 uninstalled still cannot remove background to blank edit yep still the same also please put the free backgrounds at the top this is from only within the app by the way
__label__3 this is one of the better todo list apps and integrates with events nicely it is severely let down by poor synchronisation with google tasks too slow or forget it which limits its usefulness where syncing with other applications is a concern others sync much more effectively
__label__3 this planner app is pretty clear and simple i have the paid version and it works ok except today they had a glitch and i lost everything even when i reinstalled it was just so screwed up so if you don't mind losing all of your work when they update i guess it's survivable
__label__5 love great date keeper
__label__4 good works offline so i love that but one improvement they must include is to allow us to have a hierarchy in projects else it is too cluttered
__label__5 really good app and well built with nice user interface they also have good customer service and they replyed quickly to my earlier review where i was experiencing a problem at first
__label__1 even though it had repeated reminder option it does not repeat daily appropriately sometimes reminding daily command will vanish i turned off draw over other apps still keeps drawing over other apps
__label__3 this app is going in the right direction just switched from todoist i think they have to concentrate on adding more what should be standard features before adding things like hobbies etc it's ok but far from amazing in my opinion
__label__1 not into your ads i've had your app on my phone for years uoure about to be deleted for a google calendar sorry
__label__1 won't stop charging me after cancellation when it happened again this year after they promised one year ago that they would stop i had to actually cancel the credit card upon reading the reviews i find that i am not the only one with this excessive billing issue
__label__2 i've had this app for a few years and it worked well until the last several months it's gotten increasingly buggy and will do things like forget you checked off tasks as completed and re list them as incomplete between closing and re opening the app it also had been freezing more and more frequently to the point where that happens at least once a day and now i can't even load certain screens because of this i will not be renewing my subscription this year and will be using another app
__label__3 worse than wunderlist no optional add todos to top or bottom so it's pretty inconvenient for big lists
__label__3 good lord you have to set every little detail of every single thing to get any sort of good results i mean it feels so unintuitive to have over 25 taps and tweaks you have to perform for every single item you enter into this plus having something you need to do that's instant like a social media post has to have a start and end time and won't let you enter anything less than 5 minutes hahah are you kidding me at this rate it would take me longer to organize my schedule than to just do everything the unorganized way i'm using an app called time planner instead which is still pretty lengthy to set up but much more intuitive
__label__5 this app is the best to schedule my day further more here are some possible features to add a homework option w reminder water reminder mood tracker monthly routine and calendar also would like if premium was cheaper
__label__1 no reply to my ticktick premium cancellation mail since 2 days new update another day has passed and no reply to mail has been received yet
__label__5 easy interface great help
__label__1 would have been nice to know the price before using up my data for download just to be uninstalled seconds later
__label__3 cannot share lists send invitations from both directions to lists imported from wunderlist on both sides get unavailable list
__label__1 microsoft did what it does best acquired a perfectly good app and replaced it with junk that doesn't even login wish it had google sign in
__label__4 used to love this app amazing ui simple definitely one of my favourite and so helpful this new ui thought not for me too much clutter and scrolling tried to get used to it but its not for me so it's time to let it go useful non the less so try it maybe it's your thing edit i don't know how to answer so i'll edit and hopefully it gets trough if i can get something back i would like the choice to go horizontal make it a choice on pro a bunch of horizontal scrolls is not a problem if instead i have to do a bunch of vertical ones looks less intuitive to me and i can use the go to option but i kinda already could and never did i liked to scroll horizontal because i liked the view that it gave me and the side comparison of days on same level
__label__3 reminder sometime not working so i must restart the reminder please fix it
__label__4 love the app but i notice it skips a reminder from time to time
__label__2 it submits data to facebook found this via reviewing my off facebook activity please explain what is being shared uninstalling update why forest should send basic user data to facebook in the first place without an explicit consent correct me if i am wrong and you do provide a disclaimer on user data not all of the user base would want to be discoverable by pro users
__label__4 the best option for a calendar and calendar widget functionally it is great widgets are great as well i wish the widgets would pick up the system font so everything on my screen was uniform
__label__3 does not work on galaxy watch it would be so perfect if it would the app is the best though but how can an app built for planning and reminding not work with something as basic as a smartwatch makes no sense
__label__1 set up was easy then we could not connect after a week reinstalled 3 times terrible app
__label__1 used to love it but the latest version broke it couldn't get it to work all widget face buttons would work for a few seconds then break tried all settings didn't work fix it and i'll reconsider my rating
__label__3 it still won't stop ringing and i tried to change the tone and it wouldn't do that either this is after the update
__label__1 this is awful bring back wunderlist you cant move your list around to the you want this is beyond frustrating not happy you are forcing us to stop wunderlist will have to investigate else where for a better list app
__label__3 i'd be fine with paying 10 or 20 for this app i'm not fine with paying 3 a month forever to continue using it without being able to use reminders on the free version it's no more useful than a 5 pocket calendar and i'm not willing to pay what they're asking
__label__3 app doesn't have pop up notifications anymore for my tasks that i set a reminder at a certain time for i have checked the app permissions and it allows full notifications
__label__5 great app simple and it really helps forming new positive habits it's amazing what you can do when you just do it consistently
__label__3 i found a way around this app i always do this and for the longest time forest was the app that kept me truly focused cause i dont want my trees dead but then i found out that if i remove the app from the background while a tree is planting i can use all phone features id still get the tree and coins by the end of the time i put now im just planting trees to gain coins so i can plant actual trees can this be fixed i really love the app
__label__5 this game is so great it helps you to focus in planting your tree you can invite friends to plant trees and chat to them actually this is not a game it is simple and educational pls download this game to save our environment go forest go
__label__4 how to change letter style can't read sub titles with double lines
"__label__5 hi i love this app and have been using it for a while now it is the only 
one that have calendar and to do fit togheter the only thing that i would 
add for my needs is the possibility to share with others our activities 
even in the paid version seems to not have this feature are you guys 
planning to add it on"
__label__1 i hated that you cannot edit certain things for example when you go to make a schedule there's no option to delete blank slots no obvious anyway
__label__2 okayish
__label__2 genuinely not a good app
"__label__3 i think it will be better when it has a circle on the background no need 
to open to see the timetable"
__label__5 cool
__label__5 i sent email to the developer there's only one and they solved everything within minutes great app helps with tasks and even small silly works it is improving quickly and is getting better every time
__label__5 great app
__label__3 great app but it takes away access to your data after a while unless you grant full access to email addresses google acct everything fair enough request but not by holding data to ransom either that or its been compromised by malware but i don't think so
__label__3 works fine for importing calendar can't say same for tasks os linux
__label__2 customer support is completely unresponsive i purchased the upgraded version and it doesn't sync as promised there has been no help on fb email nada kinda sucks tbh the app is nice the android widget is what makes it great plz fix the sync issue and i'll update my review if your customer support reaolves the matter and makes things right with me
__label__1 i downloaded this after seeing someone advertise it looked cool so i figured try it out right until i downloaded and it prompted me for a subscription lady you are nuts people rather by the paper agenda at the store for cheaper you do not see the full texture of the book it's an online planner on top of it i'm not paying you for that i downloaded a free calendar that does the exact same thing terrible marketing skills
__label__3 waiting for you to fix the widget issues namely parsing p and smart date
__label__1 alarms and notifications don't work which is crucial to an organiser
__label__2 notifications stopped working then it deleted all my tasks
__label__5 it's silly to think that something so simple helps me to focus but so it is the ritual of planting a tree and then not doing anything else until it's finished growing has been very beneficial for my self motivated work and i love looking back on my forest to see a visual representation of my hard work
__label__1 the idea is great however it adds only event to my calendar i like circle planer idea and that i simply can put work and then event at work and that it reflects on this circle this has potential but make it simple and functional i was used to test some apps and for me this was not functional and easy going make it that 7 years old kid can use it
__label__2 can't post to my google calendar or any other subscribed calendars disappointed because this app has promise
__label__1 this is very good
__label__4 nice app quite original
__label__3 still evaluating the app lots of things i thought are not available on free app must upgrade to premium to use app good to use so far that why rating low
__label__1 good concept but whenever i open the shop it says error code 668 i tryed redownloading and it didn't work
__label__3 not able to see flagged emails which are overdue or which are due after tomorrow it would be great if we are able to see all the flagged emails at one place
__label__3 good experience nice concept sad that it's not completely free for a to do list and completely frustrating that it keeps crashing everytime i want to edit my level and changing my avatar it went brainfarted when it got overwhelmed by a long list of levels starting from 50
__label__1 decent app but repeatedly asking me to pay a monthly subscription for a fancy to do list is completely unacceptable take no for an answer
__label__1 notification is a pro feature are you kidding me why dont you just make this app a paid app from the start
__label__2 another crappy todo list app i have to delete i dont understand all i want is a simple to do list i keep trying to add an item and it automatically goes into my inbox whatever that means i went to the help center to find a solution but a long list of topics that isnt searchable is completely useless
__label__1 the free version is crippled 3 lists max seriously just use dtg gtd to do app with free unlimited nested to do lists with tags and reminders
__label__3 it's effective yes it's better than a lot of other options out there it's just dated the interface is weak and difficult to navigate they could really make some strong improvements by streamlining it i bet most users pro or not aren't aware of all the settings response 8 8 19 thanks for the offer but i think you're missing point if i had time to help i would have long ago though response i wouldn't have paid for an app that required me that much submit feedback in a forum
__label__3 widget stopped showing the correct day which makes it pretty much useless which sucks because it was the easiest way to use the app for me please fix
__label__4 great app reasanable pro features please add multibe avatars for the kids
__label__5 if you can customize the colur of the title of the list the name that you see in the bar it would be a nice feature other than that great app
__label__3 cannot show all task of different accounts in widgets
__label__5 good develops app
__label__1 instalei de novo e não mudou muito minha ideia quero um calendário e não uma ferramenta pra integração com o calendário do google tá de sacanagem
__label__2 can't clean up old alexa lists we use this purely for the alexa shopping list integration however early on it was very buggy so we had to relink our alexa account a number of times and now we have like 4 or 5 old alexa shopping list s that we cannot delete alexa lists can not be modified with any do you can do it from the alexa app no i can not because it only deletes the working one
__label__1 can't do anything unless you buy the pro version
__label__4 keeps me on track
__label__3 a good app but does not show full month tasks and that makes it hard to plan ahead or look back to previous events
__label__2 doesn't show a files attached to the event using google calendar
__label__3 absolutely love this app and have been using it for months different lists in different screens via the widget unfortunately the widgets have become unresponsive and now i'm looking for a new app will this be fixed using huawei p20 pro mate for reference edit i have reinstalled the app taken the app off battery saver mode when i reinstalled it is still the same clicking on the widget does nothing can't add tasks at all
__label__5 it's an amazing app i love it and find it extremely useful just discovered it recently and totally enjoying the productivity it gives me i very much like the simplicity compared to other to do apps with too cluttered ui miscoroft todo on the other hand is perfectly balanced one small thing i would personally want to see is the ability to assign more levels of priority not just 'important' and the rest there could be importance levels like 'a' 'b' 'c' etc or some color coding for example thanks and keep up the great work microsoft on android is doing a great job
__label__2 great concept but i didn't build up coins quickly enough and didn't get any gems meaning i couldn't get anything new for my character honestly a calendar and check mark system would give me more incentive than this
__label__3 haven't used it a lot yet but enjoying the simple way to add tasks
__label__5 i love soo much
__label__5 the most customizable calendar app well worth the premium money but even the free version surpassed many other apps in terms of functionality
__label__1 so 2 almost 3 years ago i purchased the pro version of this app at the time that unlocked access to all present and future pro aspects now however after a long list of changes the fact that i have already paid for this app and been using it for years doesn't seem to matter i'm now constantly being asked to repurchase a product i already own to add insult to injury features that used to be standard drag drop are now a pro feature that i should already own cost 6 99 and up
__label__3 why cant i logged in _
__label__1 why tick tick for windows is available for 15 days we can use free version of tick tick on android but on windows there is time period you should allow to use free version of tick tick on windows also without 15 days trial really bad experience with tick tick
__label__1 wunderlist was just fine why the same in a new jacket done worse just because it has to be microsoft microsoft stop trying to be what others do better edge why bing why buy a good working app and make it worse again why as a ux designer to ms business stop trying to outperform others who already are market leaders start finding new solutions for new user problems and be the market leader there if not a google will outperform you because they understand user problems better
__label__3 there is no ability to comment like in wunderlist had to individually share all my synced lists with my husband and then he had to accept and delete all the doubles should have just been able to share links with another user
__label__1 how can i pay such an amount just for a to do list app i'm uninstalling it now 5 mins after installation
__label__1 uninstalled it interferes with my normal google calendar
__label__4 it's very good but i'm upset i can't open dictionary calendar gallery or even listen to music on mobile please check this out ok for social media but all no
__label__3 its not easily understood and it does not notify if you are setting a task that the due date or due time is past i might want to set 16 00hrm task tomorrow at 18 00hrm today it will still set the task and will think i have set a task meanwhile the date is today
__label__2 it's okay but i migrated from wunderlist and i still miss it plus the widget keeps on breaking not showing any tasks when i delete it and put it back on the screen it works again but only for a few days please fix this
__label__5 you win take my money i have been using this app for many years and never bought the upgrade i recently upgraded to the s10 and between bixby google and many planning apps i just couldn't separate myself from this one i simply have not found an app that's easier to add and complete tasks also the task widget is just hands down better than every other one out there so fine if you want to add fullscreen ads and have the audacity to include sound then take my money you can have it
__label__3 every now and then appears to disconnect from certain calendars support didn't have an answer otherwise i love it
__label__1 this is my first time giving a review on any app i've downloaded this app is a huge downgrade from the now defunct wunderlist the fact that you need to use a microsoft account is annoying but to add insult to injury you can't even share the lists normally with people outside your organisation what ever that means so now all i have is a glorified sticky note i mean had i'm erasing this app the second i finish this review
__label__3 this app seems great however i switched to another app mainly because the reminder alarms and reoccurring task options are locked without premium what the free version let's you do is fine but not impressive enough to risk a subscription billed annually they should give a free premium preview for a week or two so this app can showcase itselbetterf without access to reminders it felt more like a note keeping app that i had to remember to check which hindered the promised productivity boost
__label__5 no frills just what i was looking for
__label__2 nada es gratis
"__label__3 the app is good however the funny notifications are ridiculous and not 
funny at all sync does not work"
__label__1 the widget and sync functions does not work on premium i get the widget error telling me to log in but i already have and even reinstalled the app nothing works developer please fix this
__label__3 it's pretty neat i love the how everything pops out on the clock only thing is i tried scheduling things after 12 pm and it wouldn't pop up and i notice it only shows 12 hours at a time if you buy the pro version it comes with the 24 hour feature which i think is totally worth it seeing 24 hour option you can see everything from start to finish and not miss anything
__label__4 i love the new widget it's finally useful please let us change the time when the day changes for example i go to bed at around 3am i consider any time before that to still be the technically previous day that completely messes up tasks that repeat after completion
__label__3 doesn't let me view the lists from my android wear os smart watch
__label__5 i love it so far bummer to have to pay for premium but it's not a bad price i am only doing the minimum 5 habits because i don't need that many it could use a reminder notification update still love this app it's helped me keep track daily
__label__4 the game is pretty fun but it's really frustrating to pay 100 coins for an enchanted armoire chest and only get experience or food it's honestly beginning to ruin the game for me if it doesn't change in about a month i'm rewriting this review to leave a lower score
__label__1 i keep adding tasks its nit showing on widget very complicated to use
__label__1 i downloaded it and login with google i never did anything just logged in with google it has asking me many time for auto debit for subscription so i uninstalled it but still 5 min before rs 909 debited from my account this is the muging of money i want refund my money in my account kindly
__label__5 excellent app excellent widgets i use this with widget as my daily habit manager could do with an update and could have other features but what it does help maintain habit streaks it does better than any other app i've found i bought premium one off to use the apps its worth it for me don't usually buy subscriptions but a couple dollars once off worth it free to use though only widgets are premium
__label__1 this is the free version the paid version is 7 99 the platinum version is even more you can only track 5 habits in the free version developers must be paid but a lack of up front honesty makes this product undesirable i should charge for this do not install doughymiddle
__label__3 great in a lot of ways but a huge drawback is that you can't edit the start date or previous inactivated activated dates for a habit so if you've been doing a habit for a few weeks before you add it to the program you can't record those two weeks of success in the program or if you intentionally stopped a habit for a time period but didn't inactivate it during your chosen time off your percentage is dragged down
"__label__4 just a couple of things i don't like the fact that the reminders show 
up multiple times and i wish it had a to do list but other than that 
but other than that so far so good"
__label__5 always good
__label__2
__label__3 loving it but are there themes on the horizon not a huge fan on purple and where can see a weekly monthly summary of how i'm keeping up with my dailies also i noticed a bug when i accidentally hit 'create' multiple times for a new daily it will create multiple instances of it
__label__3 good
__label__2 was working fine before but it's not working now not registering my events
__label__2 i dont like that it only works with calendar i dont want a calendar even called sleep just to keep it on the graph
__label__1 installed and started setup everything i installed this for requred a subscription only install if you want to pay for everything it probably should be stated that all the good points of this app require a subscription i am now uninstalling this app
__label__3 didn't really get a chance to test it but it forced me to do a review to uninstall
__label__3 i've been actively using this and i love the concept app version could really use a new ui dark mode would be appreciated and maybe letting users adjust font or size of boxes feels too large right now it would easily hold more details but space is lost to a big box
__label__3 nice app but how to put red color t t
__label__3 1 notifications comes over my locked screen 2 notifications doesn't work properly on time would be very helpful if you add notes
__label__4 good no frill direct for what you need in a to do list
__label__1 deleted my account because i found something more aligned to my needs but i still got charged for another year developer ignored my email and then denied a refund via paypal so i've now paid 28 for something i can't and no longer want to use had no issues with the app itself but very disappointed with the customer service
__label__1 you have to pay for the dark mode really it doesn't mattee how helpful this app could be for my life if it damages my eyes a lot more just because i can't afford to go premium and buy the amazing dark mode at least those whole 2 seconds of interacting with the app were fun
__label__4 this app is really functional and helpful the widget is great caveat you can only track seven habits without paying it's one time five bucks and worth it though suggestion to the developer make checked off habits go to the bottom of the list so we can see what we haven't done yet more easily
__label__3 i have written 0 or 15 minutes for a 30 minute target the app still registers it as part of a streak even after i delete the entry seems like its just ignoring what i tell it also what i really want is an hours per week target
__label__5 excellent product i think this is the third time i am editing my review for this app that's mainly because the app popped up the review request while i was planning my tasks i should feel like i was interrupted right no i wasn't this app is helping me for several years i even forgot when i started using it and i just can't stress enough how much i like it fantastic work guys
__label__5 just a awesome app update this app has really helped with my adhd still love the app now if i could do email from it it would be the best app i have ever downloaded
__label__1 i want to delete doesn't works developers not able to delete my account
__label__3 bug confirm to delete doesn't appear after swipe to delete action but does appear during select item menu delete shouldn't it be the other way around easier to accidentally swipe or for both pls add animation to indicate syncing progress so we know when we can force quit pls add option to add tasks to top of list sorting seems random when choosing to show completed tasks shouldn't all completed tasks be stacked under non completed or is it chrono but we can't see it
__label__5 perfect hybrid of digital and paper im in love
__label__3 i used to love this app but since installing the latest version on my new samsung 10 the google tasks sync has stopped working it synchronises from google to business calendar but will not synchronise from business calendar to google i have tried disconnecting my google account and reconnecting i've made sure bc2 tasks is associated with my google account and all sync settings are turned on is this is a known issue and if so will a fix be developed please thanks
__label__3 good app but faulty notifications the notifications and reminders were working perfectly but they only work now if i open the app by that point it's too late i need the reminders to work to be effective i purchased the full version
__label__1 there's one thing that makes me crazy about apps it's when their developers don't tell you up front what the cost is of after the free trial so i won't be trying this as much as i'd like to
__label__3 it's a very efficient and useful app but i'm disappointed in the stats function it started out lagging a day behind fair enough but now it's at least 5 i like having stats to motivate me and this feature is now useless
__label__2 isn't thanksgiving and christmas considered a holiday am i wrong
__label__2 приложение выглядит нормально но с эргономикой в настройках уведомлений проблема ux дизайнер не работал несколько раз пытался включить звук в уведомлении т к напоминание срабатывало без звука только с вибро в итоге ничего не вышло зачем то три вкладки в general notification sound невнятный перечеркнутый динамик позже стало понятно что это не статус звука а сброс мелодии почему кстати не к default рингтону не вышло повтор напоминалки если пропустил напоминание не работает удалил
__label__3 great app for the most part would be nice if each project a person could list goals till completion as well as being able to have a separate tasks list one for home versus one for work
__label__1 latest update broke sync and my lists are all out of whack i live and die by my to do lists so this has completely ruined my workflow
__label__5 one of my favorite app to view my planned tasks as a graph when helps for a quick visual of what's next and when thanks for the app
__label__1 clicking on the widget doesn't open the app anymore
__label__3 this app is really very good and have a simple interface and easy to create tasks unlike other apps which are really cluttered this is what i exactly needed however the problem is if the phone is locked it doesnt ring at all also the alarm doesnt go off at the right time if i have set an alarm at 10am for a task it some times goes at 10 10 if it is locked it doesnt go at all please please fix this
__label__5 nice app but the cool stuff is locked for the membership
__label__4 good one
__label__1 it says you are downloading the pro version which is a complete lie
__label__3 initially i use without hesitation but gradually it's getting worst
__label__3 i've been using the app for a while mostly just as a reminder app finally i put together a plan to use it as my primary task tracker great app for managing tasks a little learning curve sync with google calendar was easy no custom task reminder sounds sound drink also no multi reminders for tasks or times for subtasks had to put 4 of the same daily tasks in as stretch 1 stretch 2 etc
__label__3 waste there was not an option to set an alarm to remind i can write a note anywhere i need the note to remind me which this app said it would too busy trying to get me to but it i will just but an alarm clock
__label__2 such a cool app with deal breaking bug this calendar app could be perfect for me but notifications simply refuse to work
__label__5 very motivation app it encourages you to grow more and more tree i was looking for this kind of app from long time before i used to skip a day but now i would love to grow at a least a tree in my forest app with help of this forest i can study thanks
__label__5 really impressed with the functionality by far the best to do app out there functionality is great and the ui is even better clean intuitive and perfect to utilize 10 10 for the lists sublists and subtasks even the editable homescreen widget is quality looking forward to the paired web app
__label__3 my original review seems to have disappeared i have an issue on my galaxy note s8 where i can't turn off the alarms without uninstalling i received a response from support but couldn't respond directly their response was simply that i should be able to swipe the notification and the sound go away yes i agree that should happen however that isn't what happens there is no notification from the app for the alarm i receive other notifications from the app running out of room to explain
__label__3 i used to use habitica and i must say this is a great step up i'd like to see more social features such as sharing tasks only one person has to perform said task for it to be checked off but only giving that person the experience and gold otherwise the price for subscription is too steep thus resulting in a sub perfect score i could easily justify 0 99 month or eternal subscription for 15 if that price could be met as well as fine tuning this would be easily worth 5 stars
__label__3 the app is good and i've switched to it from ticktick but then i switched to microsoft todo because of the design mainly but that's not the only thing don't get me wrong it works but there are way to many features that are premium at least make the reminders a free feature because that is just absurd maybe fix the design add an all black theme and make the reminders a free feature but all in all it's great
__label__4 haven't come across a better app if it's type it's not a project management tool but you can have a list in your reminder it's probably a big leap but if i could share the task list with somebody without exporting that would be cool the notification repeat export control is brilliant really helps me organise my home tasks without being frustratingly intrusive and distracting i've tried a lot of applications this is second to none
__label__5 works great
__label__1 what is the use of this app if it can not show notification with sound also can not alert me when i m buzy in others chaos
__label__3 i love wunderlist too bad need to transfer to microsoft to do ui seems boring i tend to forget to use this app just make it similar to wunderlist the color wallpaper etc microsoft ui is too simple dark is too dark bright is too boring not customizable either please improve it
__label__1 pesters me to rate the app here you go
__label__4 set a color which depends on percentage for goals
__label__2 it's google calendar with different color scheme
__label__2 i like using this app to organize my to do items for my company which subscribes to office 365 however since the latest update my app constantly says unable to sync even though it appears to be working when i check in the browser on my desktop even uninstalling and reinstalling the app doesn't fix it i can't trust the app with my vital work if i'm getting sync errors like this because i cannot lose anything please fix this and i will update to 4 or 5 stars
__label__4 just completed my first schedule i have high hopes for this app i had a couple of suggestions that i think would improve the user experience one would be collision detection when you try to make a new routine with an existing enabled technique
__label__5 looks clean and this app have those details which other apps doesnt have this can complete functions which i needed great app
__label__3 went for the premium subscription without a doubt definitely benefitial to those to use it honestly edit everything's good but after changing phones i've suffered having to manually copy the same habit list because the sync function just doesn't work
__label__1 i had and paid for the premium version back then when it was called habit bull i loved it but since now they changed to habit tracker i no longer have the premium add ons and they expect for me to pay again no thanks
__label__5 so addicting especially for gamers who love to level up
__label__4 i had a great experience but i gave 4 stars because the time is only for 25 minutes and again we have to open our phone to set a new timer and get distracted the best thing abt this app is that it has very relaxing sounds that help us to focus and concentrate on anything which we do i would be really happy if u increase the timer to 1 or 2 hrs thanks
__label__3 only been using for 3 days easy to use
__label__2 once installed the app was showing another time zone
__label__1 it works well when i install but not able to double coins
__label__1 fit for nothing app
__label__3 when i tried putting inmy class scheduel they kept vanishing when i add notes to a specific date it might work fine if you don't need many events but it's a pain if you have a lot to keep track of
__label__3 i like the way this app is so intuitive to use but it has just been updated and there are dots that can be selected generally on websites these are used for options you select one then do something with it but in todoist when an option is selected it deletes that task it is very confusing and counter productive swiping the task was much more intuitive i don't know why this has been changed when it worked fine as it was as the saying goes if it ain't broke don't fix it
__label__4 app is great for student's and other people who lack time management skills as long as your remain objective and honest to yourself this app will work to help you be more efficient with your time this is one of those apps that has the potential to change your life when used correctly good interface and simple structure give it a chance
"__label__2 won't let me use access weekly view unless i pay 7 99 for the year what a 
crock i'll find another app"
__label__5 great application i use it across all of my platforms seamlessly keeps me organized for my day to day week to week month to month and year to year tasks i can attach documents pictures etc for all tasks which is very useful before ticktick i used toodeldo it was okay but ticktick is just leaps and bounds better than toodeldo if you want and need organization in your life ticktick is the application for you
__label__4 i like this app i have used it for a while now and it helps only reason for 4 stars is that the percentages are frustrating i managed 122 days straight but it won't change from 98 i think once you do the full 66 days you should get 100 also would love to be able to highlight a day in the future as a milestone just different colour so i can say 50 100 days etc as a motivator it's great for a free app we'll done to the devs on this
__label__5 review update the scheduling function i wanted has been included at some point in the past which i did not know as i stopped looking for it long ago so i am now pleased and revising my rating original review this app is good but i do not understand why they do not create a way to make a recurring annual event for say the 3rd thursday in july one can only create recurring events on the same date weekly monthly annually that is not how many events are scheduled in the real world
__label__1 please bring back wunderlist the problem with to do is that it's acting as a calendar app which i already have i don't need daily tasks reminders add a date etc that's all wasted space for me but i can't get rid of it i make lists with sub files of all kinds of info to keep at my fingertips literally that's what makes wunderlist so terrific
__label__3 no email notifications for scheduled tasks not good
__label__4 funciona bien pero si le hacen falta cosas tengo la versión premium resulta que debería existir la opción de crear categorías donde uno pueda seleccionar el ícono que más le convenga de la lista que ustedes dejen y poder asignarle el nombre de la categoría por ejemplo como sabemos existe categoría denominada study pero no se puede configurar mas de ahí sería bueno poder crear categorías con el nombre de cada materia para tener un mejor control de lo que se hace
__label__3 nice app but doesn't really have what i'm looking for
__label__1 the privacy policy is just ludacris especially that all personal and private data vids pics and the rest is also collected for the appmakers own interests
__label__1 i am a premiun user installed it yesterday it refuses to open now and i feel like i have wasted my money
__label__4 super app one of features to add to basic version is type of calendar task distribution to visualise your week month year
__label__2 used this app for years but the recent addition of full screen ads is too annoying small banner ads or something similar would be much more appropriate for a calendar app why would i want to look at an ad for half a minute when it should only take 5 seconds to add an appointment
"__label__3 would love to have collaborative editing and sharing of list so that i can 
create list and share it to my sons phone so it will be in his task list 
otherwise great app"
__label__1 automatically completes task for the day as i open the program i do not have any access to see what was completed or if i lost something important i have to do
__label__5 gr8 app keep up the good work
__label__3 do you have plan to make it available as soon for android wear watches than it probably will be 5 star app
__label__3 good app but i like wunderlist better microsoft should have changed the name of wunderlist to microsoft to do added their integrations updated the program inline with user requests and it would be great the my day feature is odd since i plan my day the night before so my day events are gone the day i actually need them i don' use my day any longer instead i use important and planner as a replacement for my day and i use task as an inbox
__label__5 i was looking for exact same app for a long time and this is the app after using this app for about a week i understood my time and routine better than ever i was amazed to see that i had more than 40 hours available a week whereas i thought i didn t have enough time in my life i strongly recommend to those who wants to get the blessings of a routine and i suggest the developers that if you can bring a option to view the routine in a printable weekly calendar that would be better thanks
__label__2 nice
__label__5 exceptional
__label__2 can't use with vpn i practice information security and prefer to use a vpn whenever i can i use 2 norton nordvpn not of course at the same time in both usage cases when my vpn is activated it would say there is no connection i have even tried different servers is there a reason that vpns are a problem for your service how is your data management security does your company view people's data how do you keep others from being to steal others data because username passcodes
__label__3 not happy with the switch from wunderlist why did you remove the option to assign a list to a group at the time you are creating a new list it is cumbersome and time consuming to have to drag the list to a new group especially when you have numerous groups and lists as i do and i move them often what a pain
__label__2 functions fine in general easy drag to subtasks can't adjust the notifications to not go through do not disturb mode bad if you work off shifts can't set timing of notifications in a productivity app scheduling is important reminders require premium seriously i'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay 3 month overall average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions
__label__4 upgrades are really hard to afford
__label__4 very nice but would you consider letting people create custom categories and setting intervals such as every 2 days instead of number of times a week with that this app would be perfect
__label__5 this app has been great for keeping my goals on track i have the free version only supposedly the paid version does not sync as it's supposed to so i would be wary of that if you were considering going premium
__label__3 great app just can't justify spending 8 10 in order to track more than 5 habits when there are other apps out there i don't need to pay for to do so i'm switching to loop habit tracker can track as many habits as i want and back everything up all while being entirely free plus it's really nice
__label__3 it would be good if it was a free app i understand in app purchases but only if the app itself was free
__label__5 very pleased with the product i do however have one suggestion possibility to pick location directly from the maps would be nice
__label__3 nice
__label__5 great app 1st one i load when i get a new phone
__label__3 seems good so far i might rate it higher after using it for longer but the annoying pop up messages forced me to either say i didn't like it or rate it now edit to reply to the response there was only the option to review now or say i didn't like it i would have picked review later if that was there edit 2 thanks for taking my suggestion on board i will update this review and rating once i have used the app more
__label__5 good
__label__1 i use to love this app it is the perfect organizer with great features however for the last month it barely opens i am lucky if it will actually open twice a day the app will say not responding opens to a black page or doesn't do anything but freeze my phone momentarily my life is saved into this app so i am so frustrated
__label__1 wont synch to calendar have to buy pro version
__label__3 nice app but how to put red color t t
__label__3 helpful features but not everything accessible on app version
__label__2 i loved this app for a long time however since an update early in the year the app keeps killing my tree randomly part way through the timer despite me not unlocking or sometimes even touching my phone i contacted the dev and gave it 6 months in hopes it would be resolved but unfortunately it looks like this app isn't for me anymore i hope it works better on your phone when it works it's great
__label__3 not practical
__label__1 nothing loads up probably a bad glitch
__label__1 if you don't stop to force ads clip watching bye bye
__label__4 it's
__label__5 i'm not making full use of this app yet but it's a very handy widget for busy folks to visualise their agenda for the day
__label__3 setting things up can be a bit confusing but overall it's good the notifications aren't working on my phone and when setting the task to something that can be completed all day i'd like to be able to set times for me to get notifications about it without having to do the weird give me a notification 12 hours before the whole point of me getting a to do list app was to have not only a list but reminders so until the notifications work i'll have to resort to a different app
__label__2 worked really well however the widgets work for a day then won't respond unless removed and re added eevveerryy day won't remember to actually use it without the widgets so its useless now not worth paying extra
__label__3 tasks helps me stay organized but i still want some option to be in it like if i want to copy a task from a list to another i should duplicate it in the the same list and then move it to the other list i wish if i can directly duplicate it but not in the same list instead in another list directly but in general tasks is a very helpful app for organizing our life
__label__3 with discipline training apps the market bet is on already diligent people to buy your app with such a small margin of customers you cannot expect success from limiting customization options to microtransactions let alone subscriptions otherwise the app was decent good work credit where credit is due
__label__2 gawd what's up with the ugly orange and why can't i change it to something more palatable
__label__4 noice
__label__2 great idea but does not give notifications for me which was really the thing i was looking for
__label__5 very flexible for now waiting for the long term results
__label__3 habit widgets stopped working after a day they just go blank and don't ever come back the widgets where my favorite part of this app so that's too bad
__label__3 landscape mode only big problem cant make it portrait on my kindle fire 8
__label__2 this app would be so much better if it didn't penalize you for doing your habits for many days in a row instead of getting more experience coins you get less the longer you do something you should be rewarding the habits that people are building not telling them that once they have the habit they're going to get less for it otherwise this app would get five stars for me
__label__3 i love it but the app keeps crashing when i try to invite friends to party and i can't buy gems
__label__3 good
__label__1 download it and then immediately uninstalled have to pay premium prices to get any features at all can't even set up reminders don't bother with this app
__label__3 just downloaded the app better review later on
__label__4 i like this app i have used it for a while now and it helps only reason for 4 stars is that the percentages are frustrating i managed 122 days straight but it won't change from 98 i think once you do the full 66 days you should get 100 also would love to be able to highlight a day in the future as a milestone just different colour so i can say 50 100 days etc as a motivator it's great for a free app we'll done to the devs on this
__label__3 its ok
__label__4 good
__label__1 i like this app it's just that whenever i enter something in my calendar it would not sink right away
__label__3 for me good app
__label__5 love it has really helped me focus and complete tasks all the way through if only so i get to check them off and maintain my completion percentage
__label__4 i think that feature of changing theme should be addef and apart from that there should also be a option for showing task on thr facr of calender itselg
__label__3 i dislike the update but mostly i dislike that it was changed and i had to look here to find out why if you are going to change the core functionality of the app at least say so when i open it i am greatly fighting my response to just uninstall out of frustration
__label__3 if the reminder is not available in free version it is a waste to install
__label__5 been using it well over a year i find it useful
__label__5 1 i'm very happy i paid for the app i've used if for a couple years continuously now and it has never let me down 2 this layout is excellent for taking my days schedule in at a glance i highly reccomend trying it 3 the widget has pride of place on my homescreen and my android wear watchface the designer has done an incredible job of cramming all the important information into the widget without confusing or overly cluttering the display there are many useful customisations that i found easy to control
__label__3 it has reminders but would be great to show the due date as my reminders are often days before instead of on the due date itself and what heading it was put under so know which project's task it is
__label__4 really effective app best widget of all the habit tracking apps i've tried but the widget can be a little glitchy and i wish there were a compact version some of the ux leaves a little to be desired i'd love to see some small improvements espec to widgets but still definitely worth using premium paid user
__label__3 not bad
__label__4 this app does exactly what you need it to not perfect but great at its job
__label__4 the app is a bit confusing nevertheless the support is great the more i ask questions the more options i realize i have available to me thank you for the great support i think i'll try the app out for a while and update this review accordingly
__label__4 the app idea is great but the actual app is kinda slow and a bit confusing to get around the concept is very simple yet the user interface is way too complex and has many features that i bet nobody really uses less buttons more trees
__label__4 a liked because is simple and clean
__label__1 the ads are a joke completely destroyed the experience maybe they haven't tried searching for calendar on the play store and noticed the hundred other options look elsewhere for calendar needs
__label__3 i would have loved it if not for the fact that there is a problem with the widget on my huawei p20 unfortunately it gets stuck often and cannot click anything i tried removing the widget and re doing it now it doesn't even show my lists and i have to go into the app to check or add things which of course means once i'm done with the current ones i'll delete it a task app with no immediate access on main screen is not too helpful
__label__1 tasks don't update their descriptions until you quit and re open can't set more than 7 tasks without paying an absurdly expensive weekly subscription
__label__1 it does not seem possible to have a simple shopping list shared with another person nice app but useless
__label__3 pretty good overall notifications and reminders do not work most of the time
__label__3 i like the app and the idea i don't know if it's only me but since the app is working in the background all the time and it's a requirement from the app the battery consumption is quite high is there a way of fixing it the app is already running with locked screen it is automatically locked thanks
__label__1 bad
__label__4 super good but the any do moment no longer pops up on my new pixel 3a which is the only reason i use this it is enabled but only shows up in notifications no popup how do i get this working again
__label__3 happy with the app but personally i had two issues which are if addressed may provide sort of convienience to the users 1 if any task is not completed and deleted by mistake it can't be undone that i felt inconvenient to write the task again 2 if any task is being feeded and there also undo redo options are not available
__label__3 please allow line wrap for a event tile in the month widget and or month style display
__label__2 i started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times so just removed them and no longer use biggest feature i would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the today option for the task list widget sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when i can complete all my tasks the next day the list doesn't refresh still says all tasks are done
__label__2 used to really love this app and it really helped me start working until i found out that none of my trees die when i switch apps tried all the instructions in the faqs section of their website but nothing worked great idea but super disappointed it doesn't work in my phone
__label__5 i like this app so much it's user interface is simple and easy to use in addition it's a versatile app as it combines the features of many different applications for instance it's a to do list pomodoro and a habit tracker all in one it has helped me alot to organise my life and i really appreciate it so it deserves the 5 stars i recommend this app to everyone
"__label__3 it would help me a lot if it could silence the notification from other apps 
when i'm studying"
__label__3 در زبان فارسی به علت راست چین بودن تقویم ماه از راست به چپ ولی ایام هفته از چپ به راست چیده شده و تطابق ندارند لطفا اصلاح کنید
__label__4 great app very usable and straightforward but i wish the calendar view showed the days you had completed all of your goals for that day seeing your progress streak would be very encouraging
__label__1 i used past 5 years nice app but now more advertisement so i uninstall the app
__label__5 ive used this app a couple times now only uninstalling because school ended but this app is amazing when it comes down to it it encourages people to do the stuff that they need to without the complication of being told off by others plus it has a cool rpg theme thats great for anybody who has grown up with rpg game like elements
__label__3 i love the widgets for this app but there are some synching quirks that drive me nuts not sure if it's the app or the stock google calendar but whichever it is it's not a good combination
__label__2 serviceable but not awesome by any means i've spent enough time trying to set up tasks in here that i feel like i can't bail even though i don't love it it's really tricky to figure out how to make tasks show up like i want and have only been able to really get things set up right by using the website in addition to the app nothing is intuitive or easy to figure out in this app
__label__3 very good app but something lacl there is options default task set today tommorow etc one more problem when we add task in any list it automatically saved in other other when we add task any date it demand time necessary it shoud be optinal
"__label__3 whould be nice if i can set the view old event larger numbers than 3 hours 
this is kind of a deal breaker for what i use it for"
__label__5 good app to help keep track of multiple jobs can also create different to do lists e g one for home and one for work love it
__label__3 we need an update i love this app and use it daily but the fact that we haven't had an update in months bothers me here are some suggestions i have add a settings option to default the amount of time you spend on a task i use 45 min more color options for tasks an option to change the notification sounds for each entry a 'push all back an hour' option and more widget options thank you i love this app but we could definitely use some upgrades
__label__2 there needs to be an option on when the habit starts
__label__1 it'hs just too complicate to use for me
__label__1 the website works but the app is blank
__label__5 a great recommended app finding it useful so far be great if available on computer too to sync i had been using another good app for years but recently gotten taken over by big company and absorb resulting in event forced to use their alternative searched for replacement and discovered this app by accident and it is fantastic easy to use and great features makes organising life a breeze very happy so far
__label__3 awesome app
__label__1 ad heavy plus unable to use widget and stock calander app
__label__1 forced to migrate from wunderlist why can't the developers just keep basic features such as adding an item to the top of the list instead of bottom i also miss the today view where tasks are organised by category instead of date urgh going to look for another app sorry microsoft you ruined the app for me
__label__5 this is a very creative app to keep me amused with my versa 2 fitbit and to keep me productive when doing tasks around the house excellent job creating this app keep up the great work two thumbs up
__label__4 good application its better if synchronisation time can be improved
__label__3 not great why can't you put the total number of days completed regardless of streak
__label__3 every now and then appears to disconnect from certain calendars support didn't have an answer otherwise i love it
__label__3 please at least put an option to use the previous theme i like the previous one with flat design minimalist if you could also put a feature to have other place a comment on our list that would be great kindly prioritize the option to use the minimalist flat design theme it is less distracting which makes me more productive i recommended this to my friends because of its design good thing my other device is not set to auto update i was able to retain the previous version
__label__2 such a scam first it asks you to sign up for making duration related reminder once you sign up it says that you got pay money for that features deleted this app at the next moment of seeing those scam stuffs
__label__3 decent app but i was having issues with scheduling my week with it any time i tried to m f day schedule it repeated the same schedule perpetually even on the weekends regardless of setting day limits or time constraints will check back on this one might be my device thats the issue idk gui was clean and simple and you can set specific alarm sounds
__label__5 i like the app because it's just as it is described it is very easy to adjust times for focus tree species to plant and the motivational messages that are showed keep me going forward i don't the fact that the trees and music are both too expensive other than that not really any challenge
__label__3 it would be much better with an ability to have a report at the end of the month as to what was worked on and when ie statistics
__label__1 the free version has horrible ads other than that the app is marginally better than google's free calendar app that had no ads it was an easy decision to uninstall and go back to google calendar
__label__5 any do is just the best task organiser it has been of tremendous help to me professionally and even for organising stuff at home i love love love this app
__label__2 i like this app but one thing that i hate why do i have to be member of premiums i mean why do i have to pay if i want to track up more than 5 habit this is a free app right please can you consider or change something about it
__label__5 great app for staying focused good way to track your time spent working in a more fun and engaging way
__label__2 downloaded a bunch of these types of programs to find the one that was best this was one of the worst played with it for about an hour and couldnt figure it out
__label__4 money hungry devs want about 5 mo for simple features that's about 60 year for the fully functional organizer app other than that it seems nice so far
__label__3 great idea but really needs to be able to incorporate reminders way easier to set up in my opinion especially for repeat events
__label__1 can someone tell me why to display a freaking tree on the screen ot requires a 73 megabytes package shady af
__label__1 when opening a sub task from any view the sub task window does not even show the main list task it is from
__label__4 just installed love that syncs with google wish the mobile app allowed screen rotation wish i could zoom on the week a month view i understand mobile i in beta looking forward to the evolution
__label__1 could you make an option to not stop the trial because i dont think some people want to do the trial and it doesn't mention that before you download the app and when you do you guys get paid
__label__5 good simple screen best i've seen for a while also brings together calendar tasks and notes
__label__3 i like that you value privacy so i'm disappointed that tasks within a project can't be broken down into more tasks the comments feature doesn't seem to be enough of a supplement
__label__3 update 02 04 20 i was using this for a while but i returned to my old task manager of 15 years updated versions of course i like this out because it syncs between android and my macbook pro works a charm only issue doesn't handle recurring tasks such as recurs on the second tuesday of the month etc simple recurring tasks are fine every second monday overall very good easy to use once recurring tasks are implemented completely this will be superior
__label__5 great
__label__3 i found this app difficult to use that's just my personal opinion i uninstalled it and got a different one that is easier to use
__label__5 really helpful app to keep track of my to do list it is nice to have an app that is very organized and i can keep it separated from my other things great app and better than any app i have tried a
__label__1 somehow bought it's own subscription then i had trouble cancelling was enjoying til it stole my money i never saw any payment authorization window
__label__5 great app to track habits helps to keep me motivated
__label__3 a very helpful software especially in management work
__label__5 great app all in all
__label__2 somehow reminder function has never work no notification or anything which make this app kinda useless
__label__2 i would give this app 5 stars but if you press silence notifications you can never turn them back on
__label__3 i have bought once and uninstalled but this time i installed it again and had to pay twice
__label__2 i got locked out of my planner after entering my paascode the app said that the passcode was wrong it was not wrong i suspected a system glitch and contacted the developer on june 17th of this year i haven't received any response yet i found my way around this problem by this time i will not renew my subscription anymore i will look for another app developer with a better customer service
__label__1 i just bought premium and realized i made a mistake right away it told me to register to sync my data and i did sync option wouldn't do anything i wasn't able to set a username because of some unknown error all the time then half the screen was empty and i decided it was a glitch and reinstalled it and now all my data is gone so stupid i just paid 10 bucks to be able to create more than 5 habits and i lost everything don't recommend this app so disappointed
__label__2 while everything else about this app is good the process of scheduling a task is frustrating half of the time it fails to recognize what i'm trying to set you should just bring back the old scheduling layout from a few years ago that was easy
__label__3 it's okay
__label__5 quite simply the best cannot get over how user friendly todoist is the devs clearly designed with intention pre made templates are a godsend text markup emoji integration made me smile and powerful organizational features made me stay kudos
__label__1 ok
__label__3 add sub task option
__label__1 it doesn't let me use it it keeps saying forest has stopped
__label__1 this is a poor imitation of wunderlist not even missing the features that made wunderlist a killer app but then soon be bad design choices were made in the port why do you have to scroll to the bottom to add items why is there no api to tie into thoroughly disappointed
__label__5 sem palavras bom demais
__label__1 complicated dislike the pro version microft to do list is better
__label__1 lnot friendly interface
__label__3 i cant set widget on homescreen can you help me plz
__label__3 wunderlist was more user friendly the application sticks on one screen and won't let you close out of a list i have to close out application completely
__label__2 good app missing vital a feature it shows meetings not being attended i e going no that is an obvious feature that stops me from giving a good rating i must keep company meetings in the calendar that i'm not attending for posterity not unreasonable i think so this is a must
__label__2 used this app for years but the recent addition of full screen ads is too annoying small banner ads or something similar would be much more appropriate for a calendar app why would i want to look at an ad for half a minute when it should only take 5 seconds to add an appointment
__label__4 very good app similar to a very basic project management system you can move your tasks around so you can manage them better could have more functionality in that area not overboard you want to keep it simple but overall excellence application
__label__2 galaxy s10 on android 10 ftue is busted first two slides don't load you get to the character creation and the avatar and all of the customize options are invisible don't display please fix or mark the app as incompatible with android 10
__label__5 best ever calendar i used
__label__3 after 4 years ui seems dated
__label__5 it is so good
__label__2 i downloaded and paid for this app several days ago it has some good aspects but now i literally hate some other aspects of it for example if you set a specific time for a specific time e g 1 3 pm it disapears without giving you a chance to do anything with it so if you didn't finish that task you are out of luck if you want to move it to somewhere else how ridiculous it is i'm really scared i can't trust this tool i have to switch to something else and cut my losses
__label__2 gaada waktu kapan harus selesai jadi kurang detail
__label__3 i love this app but there's only one problem i can't sign up or sign in i was able to sign up using google chrome but when i try to do so in the app itself it doesn't work please can this be fixed i would like to be able to sync across devices
__label__5 moved here from wunderlist after trying other apps this is so clean and easy to use and does everything i needed and more my fiance and i can now both keep track of the grocery list so glad it has the ability to share with others
__label__5 without question the best to do list app it has the most customizations and functionality when compared to any other integrates seamlessly across devices good free features good paid features fair
__label__3 nice but i wish it had more flexibility
__label__3 it's nice app but notifications don't popup on my wear os watch i can see them in notification shade but watch doesn't vibrate and there is no notification pop up on screen
__label__3 it's good and is useful only problem that lets it down is you have to upgrade to premium for it to do all the things it lists so that lets it down
__label__3 lack of function in free version to extent i couldnt use at all i am prepared to pay for planner i like but it was impossible to tell i didnt want to give 1 star though as it did look nice
__label__2 good idea bad execution widgets cannot be used to enter information doesn't work you tap the arrow and nothing happens useful to display information you entered in the app though
__label__2 the new widget does not allow me to open the app directly like it could before updates should never remove features knocking my review down rest of the app is still great
__label__3 syncing doesn't work still no reply from support
__label__1 used to be good now massive full screen adds with sound first time they ran without warning very embarrassing will give it a week to revise then will uninstall adds are ok but the full screen nature with sound isn't
__label__5 excellent
__label__4 easy to use
__label__2 cant move the tasks up or down
__label__3 i need help the tree does not die if i leave the app maybe because i have a razer phone 2
__label__1 won't sync with my calendar sam note 10
__label__2 reminder didnt work on vivo
__label__1 sucks sounds good but cant share it with my wife
__label__2 tasks that repeat more than once daily dont work if you have something that is twice a day you have to have two separate tasks if you leave a task pending until the following day and complete it it will never work again
__label__1 i have used this app for a couple of years now and it was great it had small banner ads before however recently they have incorporated video ads which play every time you input a new plan this is incredibly tedious and a massive waste of time do not download
__label__3 reminders set to repeat daily don't repeat the only reason i wanted this app was to have ongoing daily reminder notifications so i will be uninstalling really liked the other features though
__label__3 no internet connection all the time
__label__2 the interface is ok but ticktick does not sync with google tasks you can import google tasks but no tasks added in ticktick app will appear on google calendar if a task list doesn't integrate with google tasks if i am limited to using the standalone app and cannot see tasks on other devices computers then the task mgmt app isn't really good for anything
__label__1 not very user friendly atleast for me the alarm doesnt ring it on only vibrates i have to put every thing manually like if its 11 am in the clock it gives me optionts what i m going to do from 12 pm and even after using it for a week i am not clear how dis format gonna helm me
__label__3 helpful features but not everything accessible on app version
__label__4 its a really good app and it motivates me to get my work done thank you so much for making this app the only problem is that yu have to pay for the whitelist because there are times when i need to surf the web while doing my work and i can't do that so maybe you could remive whitelist from premium its a great app but sometimes i can't work with it due to the premium thanks once again for the great app
__label__4 hello your app is amazing my gf and me installed this app 2 days ago and started to planning task to each other but i really need a list functional like add a shopping list or some book list to add in this app are you going to add this sry for my english btw update and i really need a functional to add a checklist in tasks with possibility to mark it's completed thank you and your team again for this great app
__label__3 really good app really helpful but guys if you can change the reminder sound from notification to alarm plzz
__label__5 very best planner i just love using it
__label__3 the sync feature doesn't work
__label__1 this app is not worth the 6 a year poorly developed with several glitches
__label__1 subscription only no outright purchase too bad seems like a nice app
__label__5 this is an excellent product allowing you make to make main lists with sub lists where needed i have hectic days and it helps me to remember what i have to do and keep a track of all the small things would love if lists could be shared with a someone and also an export to a chat whatsapp would make this a 5 star product thanks for the info steve just rated you as 5 star that does help me a lot and i'm sure many others as well who use whatsapp
__label__2 the widget is feezing after every night
__label__3 so far cool great app
__label__3 initially the app worked really well but now it is not opening and i dnt know what to do i also tried clearing the data bt the issue still remains
__label__3 this cannot sync outlook
__label__3 i think the old version is better than the latest version hope that there is an option to choose between the horizantal or vertical interface the shifting of days from left right is easier than the new one i barely use the app since the change of interface ive been using this for a very long time and it was really helpful
__label__2 i loved this app until the latest update full screen ads that you can't cancel are just too annoying i'm outa here
"__label__5 i have long been an advocate of the stephen covey 7 habits weekly planner 
approach this is the first app i've found that gives me the capability i 
need to do that well i use the projects section to set up my roles and 
goals and then transfer them to my weekly calendar my only wish is that 
the tablet and phone app worked with their desktop app it does not as far 
as i can tell"
__label__3 cant postpone a task the reminder you set was invalid because its already overdue thats the reason im postponing it
__label__3 no white space between tasks no line between tasks checkboxes are in the middle of an item one big block of text instead of neat list of tasks just impossible to see where each task starts
__label__1 microsoft to do does almost all of this for free it is pointless to pay such a hefty sum of money for these so called premium features
__label__1 this is not a multi protocol task manager as the description false implies this is a front end to their service i couldn't get past the first screen because it requires me to set up an account to sync i use a private server capable of syncing things like tasks exchange most public clouds google icloud office365 email providers have this capability therefore why should i need to send my data elsewhere if it's already on a server the fact that data is not something you can touch doesn't make it less valuable be mindful of it it is our most valuable asset today it may not be tangible but it sure can be quantified endlessly requiring signing up for any app is a huge red flag
__label__5 just the app i wanted perfect
"__label__5 this calendar is lovely to use minimalist asthetically pleasing and 
exactly the functions and view options i was looking for love it"
__label__5 this calendar app is amazing it can do so many things the other calendar apps can't huge and rich feature set very reliable 10 stars
__label__2 push notifications are a premium feature so if you need this feature this app is not really free
__label__1 i really didn't understand the interface and its too complicated
__label__1 bought the paid version and added various tasks on desktop won't even log me in or load anything downloaded the app to access my tasks and shows nothing i even paid for premium very dissatisfied and disputing through my bank this is worst than free apps like keepnote seriously disappointed
__label__3 cool concept but i don't have the attention span for it
__label__2 the main purpose of this app is to not allow us to open other apps like social media however when i accessed other apps after pressing the home button i could use them note my wifi was off the app was running in the background while i could use my phone completely please fix it and a suggestion would be to put a feature to select some apps we want to access while doing our work other than calls like 'notes' i need some apps while i study like i keep important notes i need while i study
__label__4 reminders don't pop up if the app isn't open such as clearing all open tabs or if you haven't opened it at all in a day i think that's why the app should be for remind you because you may not have the time to it's a good app but pls i'd like that this be worked on i would also be nice if you can permit the option to pick alternating days or weeks as frequency of a task may not fall under weekly or daily e g tuesday thursdays and saturdays
__label__2 sorry not impressed i'm sorry to leave a poor review but i thought it best to let the developers and others know i had so many challenges with it i wouldn't know where to begin update although i initially gave the app a one star i upgraded to two because their response was kind and professional they asked for details of the challenges i had with the app and were genuinely pleasant to correspond with so if you have a complaint share kindly because they really do care
__label__2 not exactly useful was hoping it would be easier to see or more customizable
__label__3 so i assume this app is no longer supported by its owner last update was summer 2018 and i saw lots of negative reviews here and on twitter about owner not responding at all wanted to buy premium but first checked reviews ugh it looked like a really perfect app sad
__label__3 i dont like u use numbers instead of yes or no but it doesnt show any difference on the calendar eg color difference
__label__5 it's a very good planner app i had scoured the play store for dozens of planner apps but none of their free versions were worth my time this free version is entirely great on it's own and without any ads however if you're a student as i am the duration feature for tasks on the premium app is definitely worth the 2 99 a month
__label__5 this app has made our lives so much easier my husband and i have two kids under 3 which means we have to schedule daycare drop offs pick up's packing lists doctors appointments prep for soccer swimming gymnastics this app has brought the closest thing to order we can have in our chaotic lives our friends have seen how we used it and downloaded the app for themselves as a result highly recommend using it as a shared task list with your spouse
__label__4 i like this app enough to have paid for a year's subscription but there are a couple quality of life improvements that would be nice i would love to see icons on the widget i would also like to pick icons as my avatar photo since there's some good ones
__label__1 really frustating configuration
__label__3 good app but im a premium user for more than one year and have been requesting features on the official support forum like change dates of lots of overdue dates at once on windows app and never even got a response
__label__3 the app is lagging too much never happened before and when i try to plant it's not planting
__label__3 it have future if they make notes can be organize by category tasks can create sub task and fix bug when samsung dex enabled
__label__1 it doesn't work worked fine first few hours now it keeps saying it can't connect to the server
__label__5 handy for me when i need to plan out everything that needs to be done
__label__4 their widgets had gotten better since my last review i really appreciate the calendar with the tasks on the side if there was a morning your day today or plan your day today alert in the morning that would make it even better i went to any do for that but their calendar and sync to my waze app was off so i came back lol
__label__2 interesting concept but i get a path type is required error all the time so i stopped using it
__label__2 it's a true mystery of life how microsoft can take anything and make it look ugly and needlessly complicated why on earth would they not simply leave wunderlist as is so they see nothing wrong and decide time to wreck it who is going to save us when they finally shut wunderlist down
__label__2 it got boring fast
__label__3 the app is okay it would be nice if i could sort tasks by due date change the order of to dos manually without bugs and have the option of dark mode streaks for dailies should be more visual so as to increase motivation undo button is a must sometimes the touches don't register quite a few small bugs
__label__3 it was decent but i remember having to tap so many times just to get it to record your progress not very streamlined
__label__3 manca solo una visualizzazione in prospettiva degli eventi che faccia capire bene quanto tempo occupano
__label__2 price is very high for indian users we don't get 1 10 of what a us citizen gets paid here so there app subscriptions at such prices don't make a sense
__label__5 this is a great app it has made my life so much easier i have tried other apps but this one has to be the best one so far if you are thinking about getting it you should
__label__1 i loved this app but until they get rid of the yearly charge after making us buy it to begin with i'll keep this at a 1 i did previously have this as 5 star but i can't stand companies doing stuff like this
__label__3 i love this app but recently it keeps logging me out randomly i have no way of knowing this has happened so it means i miss alarms which is frustrating and defeats the object of setting them
__label__3 a decent app for its intents and purposes but i struggle to stay invested it's visually good great icons and colours also has a nice selection of skills my biggest issue is the navigation i can't immediately see or twirl down to see subtasks actually marking something as done especially subtasks is a challenge mostly because you face to keep tapping through the task and pages of info to get there perhaps a mind map or something would make it easier
__label__3 need to explore more
__label__2 good app but once you pay for premium you get half the amount of coins as you're no longer able to watch ads for double coins you'd assume you just get double coins as standard after paying it also kills trees when you get a phone call even if you dont answer it which is frustrating
__label__2 everytime i snooze an event it disappears this calendar is useless maybe i did not explain properly it does not dissapear as in not in my calendar as an event when i have set a reminder alarm at i get a notification pop up i snooze it for 30min i do not get another reminder in 30 min
__label__2 no way to repeat a task unfriendly interface
__label__4 good app but many paid services
__label__4 i enjoyed using habitbull in the past and decided to give it another go not a lot has changed i do like the app very simple to use and gives great reminders
__label__3 a really good app but since the new update the interface look so bad was so much cuter and clean before now it's weird
__label__5 i have tried few this is my choice for work and private use
__label__3 pretty good app to take notes and lists 1 for the smart snooze feature however it's disappointing that there's no reliable way of backing up all your data even with premium the only option is to log in using a browser and manually export a backup but an automated scheduled export within the app would be way better
__label__3 this app should be made to work around certain schedules for example people who work the third shift graveyard shift have a completely different schedule than say a person who works a 9 5 7 3 3 11 etc i'm certain this adjustment would be greatly appreciated
__label__2 mostly good but simply things like creating subtasks are incredibly fiddly why can you do it from only projects why can you only do it by long pressing and dragging slightly to the right to much marks is completed allow a simple option on the menu deleting tasks is several options in etc doing almost anything other than straight adding tasks is cumbersome as hell and just frustrating needs some real ux love
__label__4 why this app consumes so much traffic in background this month it hit the 500mb in bg is this app free of malware elements
__label__5 very good app
__label__5 great tasks and reminder app the dev has been responsive and implementa suggestions looking forward to further updates waiting for the web app and list sharing edit i believe this to be a 5star app and will be once completed with the web app and list sharing if it is 5 stars now then there is no room for improvement in jan you stated in coming weeks so it should be soon we hope thank you for a great app looking forward to completion i am a paid subscriber and always will be
__label__5 excellent app helps thru the day to get things done great app
__label__3 best app to use 3 star only because it is not available in hindi language whenever it will be in hindi language i will add my 2 star thanks team todoist
__label__4 great app just like wunderlist and more the only thing i am missing is the ability to arrange my important tasks in the order that i would like please add this
__label__4 i hate change to begin with but everything has been good so far my only gripe right now is with the themes i wish we could custom pick a color or choose a photo from our phone gallery
__label__5 i use this app every day for work mostly but also for personnal tasks or ideas easy to use intuitive and convenient i love the home screen widget where i can stick a list there for frequent view and quick access keep up the good work dev s great app very practical haven't seen any bugs yet after over a year of usage
__label__3 the android homescreen widget keeps on hanging every now and then i'd have to remove the widget and then add it again to the home screen to make it work it's really a headache i may opt out of the app if the widget continues to behave like this google calendar was what i was using before and that worked completely fine
__label__1 i don't mind ads but not those which run in full screen mode and cannot be closed by me
__label__4 i love this app i have the pro version and the layout is very clean and organized however only 4 stars because it does not work on multiple devices
__label__5 the best app for habit tracking i ever tried though possibility of sorting by colour hiding tasks for predefined time and direct influence of task completion on characteristics without skills mediation would make it perfect indeed free trial would be fine too and please unite 2 done tasks of same type into one row
__label__2 could have been a good free app nice design good ideas but the free version keeps forgetting the task alarm i configured i put it at 6 but it resets it at 9 don't know about the paid one
__label__3 bought premium version of the app but the whitelist fuction not working well as the tree isn't be killed when i use app i'm not supposed to
__label__5 play rpg in real life that is a great concept i love it
__label__3 ni
__label__2 the app would work great if it only reminded you when you wanted it too what i mean is it would certainly remind me of my scheduled tasks that great but it would also randomly interrupt me to plan my day if i didn't add something to my schedule then i dont need a reminder so stop fracking interrupting my daily phone use at random times and sending me false notifications
__label__1 i paid for habitbull premium for the sync functionality which fully does not work i've tried reinstalling the app reinstalling android getting a new phone no luck emailed habitbull a month ago and still no reply if i want to take a backup i have to screenshot everything not ideal apart from this the app is decent it's got a cute meme
__label__1 facebook login fails with an error from facebook saying the login method hasn't bee implemented correctly
__label__4 it worked fine for a while but now every time i click on a task habit goal to edit the app crashes i can tick off the task and plus on the habit just fine but i can't edit anything now please look into fixing it soon edit thank you the latest update fixed it all
__label__1 rollback right after editing pls fix this
__label__4 great way to stay organized
__label__1 app looks good but does not notify me on my oppo i foloowed the instructions to fix this however they are outdated so i cannot fix this problem
__label__2 one of the most expensive apps i have ever seen or tried everything costs money subscription check paid themes check i mean i spent a fortune on apps and i am in favor of continuous support but still losing my lifetime savings is just not okay reminds me of the app newton mail where they went from free to oh my god this is expensive imo users would sub way more if the options were affordable sorry for 2 5 but if an app is inaccessible due to prices i can't say that it's an ok app
__label__4 i wish this would sync with my google task so that i can use it on my computer and ipad
__label__5 easy to use for quick list with reminders for daily or last minute reminders
__label__3 a wealth of options and no guidance on how to use them templates or examples would be useful if you're willing to stick with it you'll find it very useful the leaning curve is steeper than it needs to be
__label__3 app was great but now the system crashes when in press plant
__label__2 not competent at scheduling recurring tasks are automatically completed if not checked by the scheduled time there is no way to know if you missed it the interface is pleasant though
__label__5 extremely well design this is an amazing tool for the people who needs a good way to keep track of all your tasks in a day super helpful and very well integrated with office 365 layout this has boosted my progress tremendously thank you microsoft office 365 team
__label__2 best free calendar app i've used syncs with google and outlook calendars edited from 5 to 2 stars the video ads are too painful i've already read the default reply to the other reviews complaining about this i know the fee is low and one time i promised myself i'd get the paid versions of all the free software i use once i'm not on student income but i'm not rewarding this painful ad practice by going paid i will pay for a different calendar
__label__1 you guys bought wunderlist and i changed to todo why are killing a great app like wunderlist and replacing it with an unacceptable alternative you have fallen short i cannot invite anyone to share lists i have been very patient while you fix the invitation aspect but after months i am looking for a replacement to wunderlist which i understand you will kill in april as well as todo
__label__2 i want to create a regular schedule and be able to amend times for regular activities on the occasional week unfortunately when you amend the time once it changes your schedule completely edit i appreciate the response and looked at the guide i don't want to have to create a whole new bespoke routine day if i am just amending the timing of one event unfortunately this is not flexible enough as this won't save me any time
__label__1 stopped working is no longer opening on my phone i had set the timer and left it alone terrible
__label__3 got it for he to know do of do not do me to my do do an do gone by hi do you do of do is well your name is on the list for the next few days and i will be there at the same time i don't have a whole lot of time to get the kids to the gum wall street journal and send it to you when i get home i will send you the link to the video of the puzzle in my room you have for me to get the kids to the gum wall street journal and send it to you when i get home i will send you the link to the video of
__label__5 it's one of the best time management app just love it
__label__4 beautiful
__label__4 occasional lags are annoying
__label__2 please add disable animation
__label__3 so far it's okay as task apps go i'm a wunderlist refugee because microsoft bought them out and they destroy everything perhaps tick tick will grow on me we'll see
__label__4 this is actually a really good app i just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1 to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2 a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying
__label__3 pretty good but when i'm adding a reminder please don't assume the time will earlier in the day than the current time also it goes a little haywire during the transition to from daylight savings time
__label__2 this would be great if it didn't require me to mark negatives in other words it requires me to mark everyday i did not do something such as smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol this is overly cumbersome over time and is going to cause me to stop using the app because i don't want to have to check everything that didn't happen this could be much better if it assumes i didn't drink or smoke if i didn't make any mark for that day or at least give me the option to do it this way
__label__5 i really like the planner it helps me achieve my tasks goals have an avenue to scribe my ideas down double thumbs up
__label__3 cool idea woupd be good if it could access my outlook calendar
__label__5 perfect app which i was looking for a long time thank god it provides routine summary but if i follow different routines for different days i can't find how much time i spent for a particular activity in a particular period of time please add statistics for the past days with filters having duration like for last 1 week or past 1 month or for a year or from a selected day to till date etc please bring this feature in upcoming updates so that i will help us a lot
__label__4 just wish the app would sync so i can use it on my new phone excellent otherwise thank you
__label__3 dark mode should not be a paid for feature in any app otherwise this app is ok but feels pretty unintuitive
__label__1 there is no time setting in this graph only dates that's while
__label__1 its a great app i used for years i was ok with ads but the full screen can't be immediately banished ads make it unusable when i need calendar info i need it right now i'll give it a couple of weeks but if it doesn't go back to discrete corner ads i'm out edit post response i'd have paid a couple of bucks for ad free version because it is better than stock calendar but its not 7 bucks better so if you're not going to remove full screen ads after years of using gotta say buh bye
__label__3 still trying
__label__4 having migrated from wunderlist thanks ms really enjoying the similar experience i'm having with todist definitely both worthy of the high praise it gets and an alternative to wunderlist for us migrating away pros the dark theme is really nice sections is a nice way to break up a list project without having a sub list project having colours assigned to different lists projects making it easier to categorise option to import from wunderlist note i did not use this feature but it's a pro because there's an option to i e i do not know how well it works or not cons the resizing reactiveness of the webapp isn't ideal atm on a 1920x1280 screen the web app occupies the middle third comments are a premium only feature compared to being in the freebie section of wunderlist ditto on labels being a premium only feature hashtag support was available in wunderlist tl dr 4 5 pretty awesome to do app i missing some of the features i had from a competitor but not deal breakers
__label__1 used to be good now support is gone and can't sync devices anymore pity
__label__3 this app is great but please add the copy list feature on android too and also uncheck all feature so i can reuse a routine list without uncheking all one by one
__label__1 i cancelled my subscription back in june of last year and just realized my membership had been reinstated without my permission i would like a refund for the months between now and then and another confirmation that my subscription is cancelled
__label__3 i like this app but the ads are getting aggravating especially the trump ads i'd prefer not to see him on my phone thank you very much
__label__4 great app how can i change the alarm sound
__label__4 microsoft version of wunderlist lists can be shared and sync'd between users needs drag and drop feature to allow items in lists to be prioritised based on position
__label__3 great concept the idea of this is great but theres a couple things that need work and i have a few ideas app is very slow or laggy sometimes it wont let me click on the sugested address also would be useful to be able to click address in planner and pull up directions in google map i would also like to be able to link a list to a event and or address would also like to be able to build my desired layout more themes and stickers
__label__1 purchased the full version which did nothing opted for a 24 hour face again nothing tried to add additional events in upcoming days did not show up at all
__label__2 everything i wanted it for i had to do the pro mode
__label__4 works just great
__label__4 great for maintaining and keeping a routine this is detailed enough to develop any kind of daily weekly monthly routine and flexible enough to incorporate out of routine events and distractions if you use it right it is a bit tedious for some people that's why the 4 stars but they can keep it simple and high level if they like but if you really want to tame that beast called your work week school agenda or personal days like me this will take care of it
__label__2 tasks that i change dates does not move to the new date assigned i'm dismayed because i am a premium member moreover it doesn't have a 1 week or 7 day folder apart from the calendar i also want to see a 7 day list or folder
__label__1 don't download after installation my calendar was full of commercials you won an iphone events with alarms
__label__5 free version has a lot of functionality but i do plan on paying after a few weeks of using it just to see if i will use it consistently
__label__1 not good app all u need buy and clock facility not given
__label__3 everything is perfect its just that the completed tasks are too faded to be visible in the widget kindly fix this i am deducting 2 stars for this problem
__label__1 can't get it to finish installing and i have plenty if room gets to 97 and then stops i will revise my review if i ever get to try it
__label__5 i love the concept of this app as a nature lover i think it's perfect for me it allows me to remain motivated and focused on my studies and knowing that one can plant real trees a while after using this app warms my heart great work
__label__1 viewing the sub project tasks inside the main project was an integral feature of the app that i used daily removing this without warning as if it were an 'improvement' is unacceptable and makes the app borderline useless for me and as such i will begin looking for another app that can better suit my needs removing features and making pointless changes is no way to retain users
__label__1 i am not able to sign in to my account don't know what is happening but i believe i lost all of my progress
__label__1 this app sucks and will never let me or the people i want to share the list with log in trash replacement for wunderlist
__label__3 overall good a search feature would be great for notes thanks
__label__3 i have been using this app for years and have loved it but the latest version is sucking my battery it's very frustrating
__label__3 i constantly get a message problem with the server please fix this i liked the app a lot but i am unable to use it cause it doesn't connect nor update my tasks
__label__1 update 2 19 2020 i cant recommend this app to anyone the smart date parsing only works reliably if you enter it using military time also the fact that you have to enable alarm mode to have reminders fire on time is ridiculous i have many apps that push notifications on time and don't require that so the developers don't know how to do reminders correctly horrible app
__label__1 the app doesn't notify me when the task is ready to do please fix it or tell me what to do only when runs the app tasks work
__label__5 great apk
__label__2 this is the 10th or 11th time that i installed this app after uninstalling as it keeps crashing all the time application is very helpful to focus on work study except that it doesn't work properly i am just fed up of reinstalling this app everytime
__label__3 it's okay
__label__3 i am a premium user this is a great to do app tasks habits tags subtasks timer however it lacks things that i use on a daily basis for example integration with google calendar or its own calendar to add events not tasks edo agenda did a great job i wish tags could have different color so that i can distinguish them just by looking at the color i wish it had other features like project column where you can manage a whole project ex trello integration with google assistant etc
__label__1 i've spent lot of time creating great multilevel reccuring subtasks just to find out that i actually see them unorganized in most needful page today and in projects they are organized but all together regardless deadline this is sooooo inconvenient that makes having subtasks functionality just useless why can't you show subtasks under their parents everywhere reply sorry but it's inconsistent logic as currently you show subtasks that are not due today under task that is due today
__label__2 i have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back they say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first i did email for answers but no one will answer my questions my questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people so this could be a great app but service is terrible which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping
__label__1 got a new phone and app now won't allow me to hit sign in button customer service is very slow to respond to help love the app for last 2 3 yrs but not being able to use now is not worth my paid for it to think it just renewed
"__label__1 auto fail only works if you go to each task that's not auto fail makes no 
sense might as well go back to life rpg that feature was the only reason 
i even tried this subscription model ridiculous why would i pay a monthly 
fee for some icons they are helpful icons necessary mostly but that's 
just ridiculously expensive for some icons a one time fee is reasonable 
even if it was like 5 i wanted to like this app but this got in the way"
__label__4 this has been very helpful with tracking my habits for hopefully having remission with my fibromyalgia it sucks that there is only 5 habits you can put in but if you think about it 5 habits is more then enough to start trying to break go any more and you overwhelm yourself
__label__3 the to do list should allow prioritizing tasks by importance and urgency it would be great if you could add that
__label__3 the app keeps crashing every day and wouldn't open every morning i got to reinstall it and log in again what's wrong
__label__2 i honestly didn't get much chance to use the app before it stopped connecting and not letting me do anything before that happened i started setting up daily tasks and the part where you set how often such as the days of the week you do each task was confusing i would change the days on one task and it would change it for all of them over all too much work for its worth loved the idea though it would have really gotten me doing things to level up and collect items
"__label__3 the application consistantly tells me i have no internet connection and 
has become a pain to use i know i have internet it is slow but present 
the application would be much more useful if it could keep track and update 
your progress when it feels the connection is stable enough"
__label__2 i had a reminder set with a certain sound it never went off
__label__5 عملي جدآ
__label__5 this app is excellent my therapist suggested i started planning my days in advance to get a better handle on my sporadic attention management skills i have adhd i have been using it since friday and am very pleased i am a huge fan of rpgs and this has helped me keep focused and on task it's like i'm leveling up to go adulting if i am still using it by the end of the month effectively i'm buying the developers some coffee and getting the subscription great job dudes
__label__3 i really liked it at first but it keeps turning on the alarm for my events even though i pressed no alarm i don't know how many times
__label__3 i suddenly can't login on my account and can't sync lists suddenly it became so useless
__label__2 there is a bug in this app no matter what i selected the change time zone to pop up kept coming up if this could be fixed i would definitely be interested in using it
__label__4 i like this app because it fits well in my daily routines and offers very many settings especially regarding appearance it has some basic design flaws and misses some easy opportunities but all in all it is a valuable application for my personal time management
__label__3 a great way to track goals but quite limited in functionaliry and the google fit integration doesn't work
__label__3 app is amazing but ios version is so much better than android version it has many other settings while this one lacks them i hope this gets fixed so i can change my rate to 5 stars
__label__1 the recent ui changes are not intuitive and the snooze options still suck why can't we have a simple 3 digit numerical entry field plus a period selector with minutes hours days months etc the life reminders lr app has much better snooze options and time date entry options
__label__3 simple and effective although charging for color themes is ridiculous i understand getting charged for the other add ons but color shouldn't be extra the widgets are white and black see thru which makes it hard for me to see little dots aren't helpful
__label__3 this is so complicated it took me awhile to to figure all the stuff i would suggest add some tutorial on youtube so anyone can get used to it and the app is solid and will think about purchasing the pro version
__label__1 programmer does nog work properly it is changing times and dates on his own instead of saving time it is costing me time and money for the pro version i ran into this problem a few days after my purchase so i'm not able to get a refund while the app is unreliable so practically unusuable
__label__2 customer support is completely unresponsive i purchased the upgraded version and it doesn't sync as promised there has been no help on fb email nada kinda sucks tbh the app is nice the android widget is what makes it great plz fix the sync issue and i'll update my review if your customer support reaolves the matter and makes things right with me
__label__3 i like using this app i would love to see a sync between devices in future
__label__3 i'm disappointed that it requires the wifi to be on for it to start a timer so i have to put wifi on start a timer then turn it off and it's so inconvenient otherwise it's a nice app
__label__2 ok good to know thanks it still won't show all of my calendar items on the clock i'll put some on and it will take them off as i add more
__label__4 make some more widgets rest all app is nice and user friendly
__label__3 app is great but the events are not getting created only one two events for a day is created than even it shows created its not
__label__3 i love this app but the latest update is buggy and does not record when i check off tasks please fix
__label__3 great app just need one thing is second hand also like minutes and hours the i will 5 star and its best app
__label__3 5 years after acquiring wunderlist microsoft has still failed to replicate the great to do list manager critical features missing include natural language support for due dates not available for android or desktop grouping of lists and email notifications for reminders the app has come a long way but man what a shame it's taken 5 yrs and they still haven't even matched the old app and now they're sunsetting wl that's 5 yrs which could have been used to enhance an already great app
__label__4 incredible for keeping motivation up but the mobile app is intermittently buggy in odd ways definitely still highly recommend it though
__label__3 its alright does same as google maps
__label__5 makes me more productive
__label__5 i'm not making full use of this app yet but it's a very handy widget for busy folks to visualise their agenda for the day
__label__3 one problem with this app is it stops and also notification also hide and ask for refresh and troubleshooting then it again start show every time i have to open the app and refresh then it start working this must be solve
__label__5 i like i can have a list of my assignments to do and even create grocery lists and it sections it off automatically once done i just simple cross out what was completed no issues after using for about 2 weeks
__label__1 very bad app
__label__4 i had a problem with upgrading to premium they were quick with their response and fixed the problem right away it's a good app for those familiar with the franklin covey system and syncs well across devices
__label__3 i don't mind the switch from wunderlist but to do is missing the thing i use most which is the list of things i have to do today it was so much easier in wunderlist everything else is basically the same but i see no benefit to changing this most fundamental of features in wunderlist
__label__4 a great app for setting routines simple to use and very customizable a slight learning curve for the routine setting eg the symbols a few things that could be improved easily assigning routine for each day rather than programming a period of time from the pro version or the same routine from the free version also the widget could be more useful if it indicated the ending time as well the comment text style could also be better differentiated title tag of the event
__label__5 user friendly simple but it has all the function i need
__label__3 todoist is the best i've found for allowing me to create to do lists and then assign tasks dates and times later while syncing with google calendar unfortunately it has a bad habit of deleting past calandar entries especially those that repeat don't ever modify one instance of a recurring event
__label__5 very useful apps you must try it
__label__5 one of the best apps for time managements and highly recommended for professionals
__label__2 while the concept is good the app doesn't work in my case the app doesn't detect if i open other apps so my tree keeps growing even if i open other apps also i noticed that i would reach for my phone more after installing the app it may work for others but not for me
__label__2 pretty with nice add ons and integrations but more than once i've gone back to a long list i created to find it gone or reverted back to a very old version so annoying don't need the song and dance this app offers if it can't save a basic list
__label__3 despite lacking a few features i'd love google calendar integration please this is the best to do app i've used it's efficient without complexities that muddy its usefulness the highlight for me is a compact task list widget which allows me to quickly view a large number of tasks on my home screen without scrolling unfortunately a recent update has made its notifications insufferable and i can't turn them off sadly i may have to uninstall and cancel if this isn't fixed soon
__label__3 lebih suka tampilan aplikasi yang lama karena lebih mudah digunakan diatur daripada harus terus scroll ke bawah untuk melihat hari berikutnya
__label__5 love this app it has really helped improve my productivity
__label__4 this is a really useful app is this weekly scheduled repeat every week until i delete it
__label__4 very clear app to use please add a widget with dark background now there are only light and dark transparant would also be nice to have a possibility to make a task that can only be checked if other task is done i know there are subtask possibities but there are not so clear how to use then and they are not being showen in the main windows untill you open the parent task
__label__3 there seems go be a bug and the last task is not visible skmce it is covered by the i want to bar
__label__5 i just adore this app it has saved my sanity on more than one occasion super simple to use and i love being able to color code things and the water tracker my goodness
__label__4 definetly a 4 star good app good concepts some bugs not really pulling me in thou i forgot about it which was sort of the point of the app to make me not forget it so 4 stars
__label__4 i like this app but it really annoys me that it defaults to playing a chime when you first pick up your phone in the morning when just checking the time i don't want to be woken up even more i wish it were possible to just disable that notification instead of disabling all sounds from the app at once
__label__1 i settled an alarm on this app but it never popped up this looks like a great app but please fix this all my notifications in this app is open
__label__5 i love it
__label__4 i learned about the wunderlist buyout so i transferred over to ms to do list i love it will surely miss my wunderlist ms to do list is almost identical i wasn't too afraid of the change ms works great but my biggest complaint is when you add something new to a list it adds it to the bottom instead of the top i didn't think it added it so i added it again again then saw 3 same things on the bottom i can sort based on date added but it mixes up plz hurry the add to top option thx
__label__5 the free version is all i need it synchs with my calendar offers alarms and reminders very easy access through the notification screen one of its best features
__label__1 your app sucks now used to be good but now doesn't update until i physically open it up and then close it then scroll and then it finally shows what i want to put on the list and i friggen paid for this garbage
__label__3 its almost what i was looking for apart from is there a way to set how much xp is required to advance in level and how much xp completing a task will give you e g i want to make it so i start at level 40 in benchpress and achieving 91kg will put me at level 41 i will reach level 100 in benchpress by the time i can do 150kg completing 120kg would put me on level 70 etc otherwise the numbers are just meaningless to me really i want to set it up so when i reach my goal in each thing i am at level 100
__label__4 its pretty good so far my dailies just seem to never reset though i got a streak of 2 and from then on it never moved forward
__label__2 loading takes too long and reminders don't work
__label__3 was great but the last update stop synking the outlook account try to re connect it but no luck
__label__2 no landscape mode for tablets i like the browser version but landscape support is essential to me
__label__1 all features are available only on premium
__label__1 completely unusable on android right now everything is blank or not loading downloaded and deleted right away which is unfortunate because it looked like something i'd be really interested in
__label__5 initial setup is hard to comprehend but it's a great tool once you've learnt your way around it by trial and error thanks
__label__5 great app works very well it helps alot especially at this time with this pandemic helps to keep everything that you need to keep track of what and where you should be and to keep track of your symptoms and must know information check this app out
__label__3 it is useful but very user friendly
__label__5 the app is great but i cannot purchase premium version it says that cannot connect to internet and my internet is working so i cannot use all advantages of this app unfortunately
__label__3 i really like the idea of this app however you'rer not allowed to use lot of useful features unless you pay and that's upsetting l
__label__1 newest update to the widget made it suck there is not a reschedule button anymore which i used to use to move all my overdue tasks to a new day also no button on the widget to open up the main app anymore
__label__3 its awesome but needs an improvement it would be nice if i could visit my notes and edit my notes online in my pc not just through the phone
__label__3 this was a great app for productivity but it was initially difficult to navigate through once i figured it out it still took a bit of time to set up and keep track to if you've used baby of these this interface is beautiful but it takes some time getting used to the input and progress
__label__3 looks promising but i can't create avatar due to this error path 'profile name' is required
__label__1 wunderlist was better please change the ui back to wlist style which makes it easier to read for example don't have completed and non completed tasks right next to each other in a list also comments needs to be separated automatically with a date specified that states which date that comment was added and by who
__label__2 did not enjoy the layout workflows rewards explanations a for the effort
__label__2 app is very buggy week view is completely unusable shows some events twice and some not at all also it would be nice if there was an option in month view to see the names of the events without having to click on every day individually fix this and you'll get 5 stars but without that especially week view the app is useless
__label__4 i love this app it makes my day to day so much more organized and pretty it allows you to keep a check on your daily water intake your to do lists grocery lists events whatever you have in mind i find that the layout of it all helps me to maintain productivity i only wish there were a widget available
__label__3 could be a great app except that like another user said it does not sync between devices when the description claims that it can that's a big letdown for me because when used any other of my devices and when i switched phones i couldn't sync the app up with my data or any habits i've been tracking even though i have the premium account when attempting to sync it always says that there is no internet connection but there always is so i can't give it a full 5 5 rating otherwise i might
__label__3 apparently i rated this app one star this time last year but i don't remember what the issue was so whatever you guys did up to now with improving the app is good unfortunately i'm heavily dependent on having a calendar view not google calendar integration but rather an option to display days via calendar so until it's put into the app i will be uninstalling and standing by for the update
__label__5 didn't syncs with google account
__label__4 what programming language used to develop it for android i'm a student i wanna build apps please help i loved the app i find it very inspiring
__label__1 paid for the pro version but can't keep the changes i make to the settings
__label__1 too many long ads
__label__3 for me it's hard to use it and time taker
__label__5 great for geting your life together
__label__3 nice calendar app using it with several active sync calendars however intermittendly it happens that some or all events show up twice only solution is to remove the account and recreate it it's annoying when you have more than one calendar account we have four
__label__5 brilliant app must try and never uninstall
__label__3 it's such a great app but i can't receive any notifications of planting reminder
__label__4 i loved this app worked so great i purchased it now it has logged me out and says i don't exist
__label__3 even though the app is good enough but it isnt free when i started the timer it was asking me too pay
__label__2 can't sync calendar unless you pay which makes the unpaid version useless to me i'm not going to go through my entire calendar and add my events by hand to a second calendar pointless
__label__5 the app is totally spectacular the best of them all
__label__2 no graph showing shows the task sector on phone app but on watch its just the bare bones time with no events charted
__label__3 i've turned off every notification option i can find and i still get pop up reminders on my screen i just want a silent reminder in my notification bar can't tell you how many times a reminder has popped up during a call and i can't press the end button to hang up or accidently clicked the reminder while trying to do something else on my phone please give an option or tell me where to find it for notifications without a popup on the screen that steals focus on whatever i'm working on
__label__4 great app for the most part functionality is amazing sync is great but i really hate that this app puts itself on top of whatever i'm doing every 5 minutes exactly been through all the settings and turned all syncing off but no incredibly obnoxious on my tablet haven't had the same issue on my android phone
__label__1 it's broken i try to create my account and i can't even use the name i want or customize my character it's just broken nothing displays
__label__1 asking to buy pro version when clicked on new program
__label__5 exellent
__label__1 no subtasks
__label__4 this is a great app helps me a lot but i have 2 problems 1 the app doesn't give notifications on time when the time is up it used to give proper notifications before but for the past 2 weeks it doesn't sound on time 2 another problem is that i'm not getting the coins i earned sometimes when the notification doesn't come as described above i don't get any coins and the timer resets itself without awarding me my coins i request you to fix these 2 problems as soon as possible
__label__1 can only put 5 tasks before having to pay
__label__5 awesome
__label__3 don't have option for windows surface pro
__label__5 very rewarding enjoyable past time
__label__3 too many fake menu items in the free version all that items just ask you to buy the paid version
__label__2 for the first week of using it everything was okay but suddenly all of my progress were gone it was frustrating and when i tried to use it again the plant does not change with time for example when i adjusted the time to 1 hr the plant is still a bush i tried the max time but the plant is still a bush so i uninstalled it but it is still a good app
__label__4 can't fully scroll to the bottom of the options list of a task can't see the delete option fully
__label__1 one star only because the checklist item has way too big paddings thus i can see 30 40 less items on a screen than in wunderlist microsoft ux team how could you make such a huge design mistake
__label__3 this app is great i've used it for a year now but i find that the app was preferable prior to the update i really don't like that the plant only changes or evolves with at least 60 minutes now it feels like anything under that does not matter if i focus for 10 minutes or 50 minutes makes no difference in the app which is a little demotivating please consider changing this other than that phenomenal app
__label__1 it's been 1 week since i'm using the app the reminder system worked fine for 1day and from next day the reminder system stopped functioning really disappointed may be uninstalling the app after few days hope this helps
__label__5 exceptional tip top services mateys
__label__4 very helpful the best yet
__label__3 best wunderlist replacement i can find expensive widget doesn't scroll which makes me really sad i can't keep wunderlist
__label__1 removed support for google drive backups
__label__5 i enjoy the sectograph widget a lot
__label__3 i'm considering uninstalling this previously wonderful app since the last update the widget has gone completely unresponsive
__label__3 really unique app that motivates me to get stuff done unfortunately this app needs a lot of work i tried writing a message in a guild chat once it got long enough the words disappeared behind my keyboard so i couldn't see what i was writing when i put the keyboard down the send button disappeared as a result i couldn't send my message theres no search for trying to find a challenge that suits you theres no notifications when your party is chatting there is also no search for guilds i just started this app and so for these are the problems i've noticed otherwise it is great and i hope it improves
__label__4 like the app but wish it had widgets to be able to see calendar at all times
__label__3 it's simple and easy to use but notification often doesn't work about 10 times a day
__label__5 very good
__label__1 loved wunderlist was excited about the over all design and compatibility with microsoft now in charge unfortunately i haven't been able to join any lists or have anyone join my lists which is the entire point of this app for me hope to see this fixed
__label__3 pop up notification alarm with voice is not available please do needful check to do reminder it will help you to make your app improve
__label__3 i suggest you add a deadline button instead of just tasks and events personally that's the only reason i dont use it is the classifications aren't enough
__label__3 it works great for me but my friends are dealing with the days not reseting and aren't able to deal damage our monster please i cant do this alone our party needs help
__label__5 this app is amazing you can customise your tasks and give yourself rewards in a shop it really boosted my productivity and helped me get through the tasks that were a bit harder highly recommend this app especially at this time
__label__4 was great earlier but stopped functioning after the update i guess it is not compatible with some android devices this is really bad people out there are shifting to an alternative app called focus plant would really appreciate if all devices are supported edit working now for those whos tree is not dying go to settings and disable the option lock forest to stay in foreground developer pls note
__label__4 i'm waiting for it's windows app
__label__3 i keep getting a popup that habbitbull has stopped working idk why it was even open in the first place but it is constantly annoying me and i don't even see any of actual issues that the crash is causing besides the annoying popup i've sent feedback a few times but no response
__label__3 the app itself is really great however if you are going to buy premium please make an account first then buy premium i bought premium without an account and was fine until i switched phones i couldn't buy premium again because the option had disappeared but i didn't have access to premium features i had even emailed support about the issue and gave the invoice number from google play store no response this is enough to make me not use the app again
__label__2 can't see new topics of discussion also can't add discussion topic even though i have excellent internet connection wi fi or data please fix i have no connection issues with any of my other apps
__label__5 basic functionality and apparently that's enough for personal usage but this animations and user experience make you open this app again and again and again
__label__5 does what it does well i'm glad
__label__5 i love this i use it all the time to keep track of client appointments as well as keep notes of events extremely easy to use and set up a
__label__2 didn't get past not being able to use it in portrait mode i think i should be able to choose whether i need widespread view as in a spreadsheet or a portrait view to view a page of writing and this does not give me the option i may end up using it this is only the second app that i have tried for organizing by used to be hand ink written notebooks
__label__3 not working on my chromebook i cannot open any lists to view the contents edit issue seems to be resolved in the latest update though still only giving 3 stars since this is taking over wunderlists but is still comparatively lacking in design and ease of use
__label__2 lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget i use todoist for homework assignments and i used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for without being able to see all my parent sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app i went back to an old apk but then i started getting prompts that the app would stop working if i didn't update i still use it as a grocery list with ifttt until keep is fixed
__label__3 working great so far until my nokia 8 1 was forced to upgrade to android 10 lately after the upgrade reminders no longer show in pop ups though they still appear in notifications please advise how to enable pop up reminders again thanks in advance
__label__5 awesome to use
__label__5 exceptional works perfectly
__label__3 why is it so unstable
__label__4 very nice but would you consider letting people create custom categories and setting intervals such as every 2 days instead of number of times a week with that this app would be perfect
__label__5 cannot log in
__label__4 easy interface
__label__2 im sure the app is nice but i cannot add a routine or any activity nor i can delete anything
__label__3 very customizable and easy to use works great with google calendar but i can't get it to sync with my office 365 outlook account bummer
__label__1 definitely not for me it was confusing but hey if you are a gamer and suffering from mental health stuff its for you
__label__3 i love this app but it sucks that i can only use it on my phone i'd give it a 5 if i could a use a desktop version of the app as well b sync tasks with wunderlist and c sync reminders from google calendar as tasks on planner pro
__label__1 didn't sync at all with current list
__label__2 nested can be improved
__label__3 this is a good app however it has a few bugs that need attention that could easily make the app 5 stars
__label__4 useful efficient and simple while some people find the simplistic nature of the app as a downfall i believe this is one of it's best features i can make tasks with deadlines and make the subtasks have subtasks meaning big projects are a lot more step by step and manageable i've recommended this app to a few friends and would do the same thing for others especially students
__label__2 reminders are not working i have an asus zenfone 4 shouldn't matter and i have set the reminders multiple times with no success i feel this is the most important part of this app as i need reminding in order to affectively create a habit any feedback would be greatly appreciated my rating my change after feedback
__label__3 the app is crashing after i tap the plant button please do something about it
__label__3 i love the idea of the app cantake a minute to figure out wish it had its own calander or was able to sync with others other than google calendar
"__label__4 i don't quite get the categories for tasks i hope there is an option to 
hide it or remove it"
__label__3 great app i wish i had more chance to add reminders without buying premium
__label__3 it's easy enough to use as it is but for a fully paid app the graphs are incredibly lackluster and basically useless all you get is some minuscule measly bar graphs which are tiny and get this they don't even label the metric you're tracking as they are displayed in the order in which your goal list is so unless you memorize that goal 7 is say exercise daily you won't even know what you're looking at additionally the streaks are glitchy as hell and often times do not calculate correctly really wish they also had aggregate goals for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy no gluten and no sugar it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs and come on add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month
__label__3 i really like this app though i've only used it a week i have some suggestions though when i add a habit i'd like to add it for the week but not weekends in daily tasks i can the same task more than once which is a bit like cheating maybe add a pop up message that says you've already done that today
__label__1 i can't share my lists with my partner because i'm told i'm using a work or school account but i'm not no such problem on wunderlist
__label__2 i upgraded to pro after a couple of weeks initially excited about the app having used it for a while now i'm starting to regret my purchase there are some pros but more cons it's buggy doesn't sync well at all across devices the ui is very cluttered the forum needs serious updating a search tool for eg the last update was ages ago given how pricey this is you'd think the developers would make it worth it but they seem to have disappeared
__label__3 tick tick is brilliant app i have been using it for almost 2 years and i even subscribe to the upgrade unfortunately was disappointed that it automatically subscriberd me to auto renewal without providing me the option to choose yearly renewal i have since unsubscribed i would like to upgrade but only if i am allowed to choose yearly upgrade not auto renewal
__label__3 i've just installed this as and won't be using it due to it requiring you to create an account and login it sounds like a fantastic app but i'd much rather my data was stored locally where only i have access to it
__label__3 fix the widget bugs please
__label__1 crashes on android 4 4 miui 9
__label__5 actually it's pretty darn good yes you pay a subscription for full functionality but if you have a lot of projects and other stuff to track it's worth it i also have to say that i love that there is a nice chrome extension widget whatever so nice to be able to work on the desktop as well yes onenote is good but honestly ticktick is much much better for tracking tasks with due dates imo cheers
__label__3 please add folders wanderlust has folders it's an important feature for me otherwise theres too much lists to manage
__label__4 ótimo o app porém ele é meio que um relógio de estudo que marcar cada segundo
__label__4 helps me to stay focused
__label__1 i removed this paid app i missed about a dozen events over the few months i owned this i would look at the app a few minutes after an event was supposed to pop up and it showed that it had missed i'm trying out simple calendar which testing seems to work better
__label__1 dear developers when syncing will be fixed thanks
__label__3 after the new update i cannot plant the new tree real tree
__label__3 game is great can give back results where you put in effort however when i last tried to put in a task everything was empty and i cant seem to log back in
__label__4 great app to plan out your weekly schedule especially for a college student however i wish it would show the amount of time being spent on each activity on the widget it shows it when you go into the app but that's less convenient and helpful if you want to do a quick check to see how much time you have for today's lunch break
__label__5 forest is such a great app to help you focus and motivate you to concentrate and stay off your phone i'm currently saving up to spend my coins for a real tree i love that concept so so much
__label__3 was very happy with the widget but the refresh button stopped working outlook 365 edit events from google calendar are synced fine events from outlook 365 to mobile device sync fine but edit them do not sync them back manually refreshing from the widget does noting for outlook 365 manually refreshing in the app works without problems these are all actions when using the device nokia 6 1 and not in battery saving mode
__label__1 can't even use labels for free it's a premium feature uninstalling on principle
__label__4 quite adequate for reminders simple and easy to use
__label__1 app freezes every time i add a task when i close and reopen the app the new task is there like nothing went wrong
__label__5 simple easy to use and attractive i use it for block planning so very useful
__label__3 awesome app if you could add undo feature if we make any changes to the todo unexpectedly and press back then it saves it and we cannot find what was the original memo
__label__1 the most trash app i have ever seen
__label__2 i like how this become my favorute game because it keeps me doing things but it is constanly in problem crash unable to load bug not processing and i don't understand why the task constanly can't be arranged
__label__3 good app that does it's supposed to wish it had some improvements to make it great suggestions in the in app forum
__label__3 doesn't meet my needs i'm looking for a to do app that allows me to see the tasks on my smart watch click them done then restore the tasks wanting to create a task list that i'll do repeatedly i do not want to have to touch my phone this app doesn't perform in a manner that supports that
__label__4 a very good pie chart graphical view of your schedule with nice colours and everything is good about the app specially the graphical side i'm not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today my whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45 looking as faded blue and nothing else was there i also have screen shot of the error if developers need it else it's a great app soon will buy the pro version
__label__5 what a great app i love that i can create sub tasks i also love that i can move the finished tasks to specific tabs it makes it easy for me to tell which of my orders have been paid which have been completed and which have been sent
__label__1 been using this app for years this app called itself business calendar but now includes popups which blasts the speaker at full volume how am i supposed to use this app during business meetings like the others who gave their feedbacks guess it's time we move on to another calendar app like onecalendar which dosent have ads
__label__1 seems broken cant complete the process of creating new tasks so i'm just stuck with a huge empty menu i cant change loved the idea but this is broken and unusable
__label__2 great concept but really quite bad execution with so many bugs even in the new player introduction it feels like an early access not v2 2 of anything surprised to learn that it's been in public release for 4 years now i would be ashamed to make or spend money from any transaction within this game i'm not usually this harsh and i hope none of the devs take this review personally but get it together needs a major qol ux overhaul before i would consider the concept v1 0 complete
__label__1 update after getting a response from the developer i would change my rating to 0 stars if possible these guys hide behind confusing and opaque terms and refuse to budge at all i'm so annoyed that my money has been lost to them really terrible customer experience original be very careful when signing up for a free trial of this app if you happen to go over they automatically charge you for a full years subscription and refuse to refund terrible customer experience and the app is just ok
__label__1 i am also looking to change after years of usage the app stooping to advertising unless a new upgrade is paid is dishonest i paid for my old version and was satisfied with its functionality not interested in your new version
__label__2 need full version for anything more than a calender
__label__4 microsoft is like wanderlist originally had issues sharing and syncing this to do list app appears to be settling down we like to it now
__label__4 i really like this app to establish a new routine i strongly rely on my calendar at work but setting it up for routines outside of work is tedious at first it takes a moment to understand how repeating activities are set up but now it's a great tool feature suggestion it would be also really great if you could include a habit tracker into the same app
__label__4 functionality is great however after certain periods of time the widget goes blank i have to remove and re apply widget in the home screen to get tasks to appear again
__label__2 love the app good functionality nice features but missing option to lock a note for security and or prevent accidental deletion needs an un do don't save button i have lost so many notes by this app accidentally grabbing text and replacing it with copied text or what it thinks i want to say
__label__5 i absolutely love this app first of all it actually works and give me all the motivation i need to get stuff done secondly the community is awesome and there is just so much stuff to do recommended to everyone looking to develop habits
__label__4 good features n easy to use
__label__2 it was good for a few days but now it's not loading on my browser at all gateway timeout and changes i made on my ipad are not syncing to my phone not useful if nothing works
__label__5 good way to keep in touch with actions works well with planners
__label__1 i used to use it all the time before but now it just stops working all the time even after uninstalling and downloading a billion times
__label__2 great app but it just syncs to my google calendar making it redundant i wanted to use this for nonpersonal task and keep it separated while using the app i get 40 notifications because it updates my personal calendar as well i gave 2 stars because otherwise the functionality and ui is really nice
__label__5 very competent app i have actually migrated from todoist after 3 years why because i piled everything into todoist because of its wide functionality but couldn't see wood for the trees any one item could be a project header a complicated task or a trivial one off task i have now reverted to managing projects in appropriate software in my case mindmanager with a task export to outlook and synch to todo and tasks in the very neat and focused todo app which grows on you as you use it
__label__2 osm app but now its update an i am not able to see my all reminders that i use to remind my self before uninstalling the app
__label__3 it doesn't work well for repeated scheduling of regular tasks i have tried selecting every week or every 7 days and repeat either does not work at all or shows up only for the same day monthly not weekly
__label__1 this program does not work period installed opened just sits there at the start screen frozen and does nothing no available controls or menu nothing do not use it there is nothing to use
__label__3 hi stephen i was getting used to using this instead of the late inbox reminders but some repeat reminders just aren't coming up anymore high reviews and great until it wasn't great there should be an option to make recurring task reminders to not have due dates it should come up and i can clear it without removing the reminder from showing up due to needing to move out the due date can there be just an option to make a task not have a due date and make it recurring every so often thanks
__label__3
__label__4 it's a good tool
__label__1 i have premium app sync is not working no repply from developer just waist of money
__label__3 too much paid only
__label__1 they are greedy as hell app size and ram management is very poor won't let you use anything unless u pay for no trial or anything
__label__3 its not a bad app at all but it could be better if you could keep track of how often you complete a task that would be better like if you checked off every time you shampooed your hair it would be nice to keep track so you can change how much you shampoo if needed also i feel like having a bar at the top to switch between lists makes more sense than the way it is now you should still give it a try if you need something like this because you might like it better than i did
__label__5 i can see this app sereously help me and family members build good habits i'm excited to give this a shot
__label__2 easy setup for the most part but ended up deleting it only one level of subtasks makes the to do list suboptimal only links to google based calendars so my work school and personal calendars aren't seen there is a disconnect between the app and the referenced article's options and instructions i don't mind paying for premium features as long as it is a one time payment the whole saas model is annoying
__label__2 well it worked perfectly fine for 2 days now it freezes after the vibration during completion of time the record of work also failed to register after it force closes itself example today i have studied like 4hours constantly and it only registered 60mins of work rest of the time it freezed right after the completion uninstalling such a huge app
__label__4 i went a got the full subscription and i really like it so far but i wish you could download it for your pc as well
__label__1 i couldn't work out how to use this app and decided to stick to my conventional hand written to do list and i uninstalled this app however i still keep getting 'reminders' about things i never even put in myself they seemed to be there maybe as examples when i first installed the app i find this really annoying how can this even happen
__label__5 great app been wanting a routine type ap for awhile definitely nice to have for my schedual
__label__3 love it simple to use
__label__5 wonderfully app i have a suggestion to add sticky in this app instead of office or make a spreat sticky app sync with microsoft windows
__label__5 i love this app is very simple to use yoh can set the time for reminders is not annoying and i totally recommend to use it the only thing i would like to improve is to put first the task you havend comple
__label__1 terrible
__label__1 why is the timer not working anymore worse after the update nothing appears but a black screen i've been using this for a few months already and this suddenly happens sad that i'm even on a pro account and i can't make the most out of it so disappointing
__label__5 very useful app for keeping track of the day
__label__3 i like it and to be honest for a free app it's pretty good my only gripe is that the home screen widget doesn't update however it's good enough for me to leave tick tick
__label__3 parece una gran app pero no se me actualiza el idioma a español a pesar de que ya lo configure para que asi sea una lastima
__label__3 a minimalistic task management and scheduling app with an beautiful interface and great widgets as well and packs a punch in terms of free features any do does not allow sublists and allows only one level of subtasks to ensure simplicity but compromising power i have also found it quite cumbersome to add a task put it into the right list and add a label to it this is a long drawn out process which takes so much time and completely ruins the rest of the simplicity the app has
__label__1 it's not working
__label__1 paid for the premium app last year now there is no history of my email address ever being registered despite me having the confirmation emails from them when i first paid for it lots of complaints on here get one of the open source habit trackers back it up yourself to cloud storage rather than spending money with devs who change the app name slightly try to charge again seen this happen so many times
__label__2 its good for making lists but if you want reminders or other features you need to upgrade to premium its just not for me
__label__3 it's slow to update and pretty buggy but it's a good idea and helps me and my friends maintain accountability
__label__2 at first i thought 'wow this can do everything it's exactly what i need ' when i downloaded it and got to test it out i noticed the features i needed the most were on premium i'm fine with that but only if premium was a one time payment not monthly payments for a membership monthly payments are for bills taxes video subscriptions vpns maybe even online storage subscriptions but most definitely not calendars or to do lists those should stay as free or a small one time payment
__label__3 many critical bugs that don't get fixed within a long period of time also many times doesn't sync changes to specific calendar or changes on one event out of a series of events
__label__2 good but the paid version did not work as i wanted to use it more so i was disappointed
__label__3 why doesn't adjusting habit streak reflect in health and experience say if i accidentally clicked or for a habit
__label__1 one of the central features that you cite in your description is a premium only feature misleading waste of time uninstalled
__label__1 i was looking for a class schedule app and this was not it
__label__5 seems great so far if you add an option to make the widget clear or transparent i'll give you money for premium edit they literally added this for me in less than a week
__label__4 i love this app it gives me purpose to keep on focusing one suggestion can we have full screen zoomed view of the forest
__label__1 was forced to be transferred here to wunderlist everything is ok but guys can you create few background themes at least cuz it's annoying to look at white and black to do list like wunderlist had some cool pictures in it you don't
__label__5 for years i didn't like digital calendars they didn't offer me the overview i liked of physical calendars and notebooks i was very sceptical of digital ones and their cumbersome features and options writing something down with a pen seemed sooo much quicker and more direct then i saw a friend using business calendar and immediately i was intuitively drawn to its good overview of events simple access to features and quick but precise 'taking a note' 'making an entry'
__label__5 it has helped me to get track of my productive hours
__label__4 great app for task reminders reminders notifications works well easy to use
__label__4 it's a great app it has this option to connect to amazon alexa which is great but i wish there was the option of connecting to google assistant otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars
__label__2 wunderlist is far better this is no way close
__label__1 cant re edit time that ive set necessary to delete and redo the process also i need a reminder for every hour and had to create 24 reminders instead of 1 reminder running every hour poorly designed
__label__4 pretty good app lets you organize tasks by categories prioritize based on due dates and set reminders for each specific task however sometimes reminders fail to notify you in the specified time and come rather delayed
__label__4 keeps all meetings organized great app
__label__5 i like that you can repeat task in certain time period from completion date this sets this app apart from most other to do apps
__label__5 i've always had issues with consistency and will power it's very helpful when can see my progress it even tracks the percentage of your success
__label__5 excellent
__label__3 i've used todoist for years and it's a fantastic app but i won't give it more stars unless they show sub projects under the parent project again like it is on desktop edit i added one more star for having configurable swipe settings which i really appreciate this feature allows you to replace swipe to right to select with done which is far more useful
__label__4 there are some things i feel need to be ironed out e g i found feeding the pets mounts a bit buggy but overall it has definitely helped me think more about my personal goals and how to approach them
__label__3 i wish widget would have a very compact design just a list of tasks nothing more no menu bar no headers etc as for me the widget eats too much of homescreen space and is not optimised
__label__4 i like using the app and my weekly progress i would like to see a total of how many things i did each day and maybe a graph i like positive reinforcement
__label__3 migrating from wunderlist couldn't have been more painful first i had to open microsoft account just for this app then importing from wunderlist messed up owners all lists that were shared to me ended up as mine i had to re share them to the original owner again anyone invited to the list must have ms accounts i had people leaving because of this and i don't get any notifications when people add new tasks it may look the same as wunderlist but the app is starting to annoy me
__label__4 real good you star focus on you schedule and all the dead times
__label__1 terrible i transferred all my lists from google to this app do they would all be in one place and they didn't save so beyond frustrating
__label__2 i loved this app until the latest update full screen ads that you can't cancel are just too annoying i'm outa here
__label__2 this tune can make alarm i set a few alarm is not ringing
__label__3 seems pretty good but totally crippled the free version by not allowing reminder notifications what's the point without those not bothering with it
__label__3 some features are to be paid
__label__2 issues with notifications and reminders
__label__3 it's ok but a bit too simple and the inspirational messages don't change not really very motivating to use this app compared to my previous habit tracker the app's look doesn't come exciting to look at as well
__label__3 i dont like the new update tapping the circle to finsish taps is not nearly as satisfactory as the swipe from before more importantly however this means i very easily mark tasks as done from the widget by accident as it only requires one tap now before the widget required 2 taps to mark a task done which is how wdgets should be
__label__4 i am using this appa past few months seems good to me this apps helps me in organising my stuff i love it
__label__3 i really liked the app and had been using it for a few weeks but a while ago whenever i would open the app it would load for a bit but then freeze and crash if i tapped anything the rest of my phone still works fine doesn't freeze while this happens is there anything i can do to fix this i would love to continue using this app thank you and i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling edit clearing did solve the problem for now too bad i had to give up all the progress i made but thank you anyway at least i can use the app again
__label__1 want to know that is there any feature like wunderlist app to get notification of comment on all shared members on their app as well as on email
__label__4 this app seems to work pretty well the user forums aren't well managed but remain useful habit tracker has never crashed on me but it does have the annoying habit of changing where in the ui has focus at the time you launch the app fortunately its easy to navigate
__label__5 love it great app to get off your phone please extend optional time of focus past 3hrs create more trees and plants in the future as well as allow users to plant more than 5 real trees great app just some helpful suggestions from someone who loves it
__label__5 best todo app love it
__label__5 it's perfect i've made excellent progress on my newly formed habits and i meet every task thanks to this app
__label__3 previously the best to do app by a million billion miles i have tried many other systems and this one beats all the others for sheer usability and adjustability excellent system 26 10 19 update this major update to your app is for me unfortunately counter intuitive poor and makes my life harder i like enhancements to apps but sometimes as in this case fiddling with something which was already very good is likely to make it worse many of the new features make the app worse
__label__5 i love this calendar app this is the only digital calendar that i have been happy with i can easily see what i have coming up i love the 'tasks' and the ability to make my to do list right on the app and the ability to easily snooze a task ii didn't get to until tomorrow love it
__label__3 i love the app but a possibility to put in task progress 0 100 would be great in the updated version when i select the filter 'view all' on my widget the subcategories are gone and now all tasks are only ordered by priority without regard for category that is very very confusing please bring the categories back or at least an option to show them again
__label__1 can't even log in seems to stop working or freeze up every time just downloaded the app for the first time can't make a new account or log in waste of time will be looking for other apps that actually let me get past the log in screen
__label__4 it's not a bad concept at all and i'm happy it helps in real life too but i was excited for the whitelist feature and it's only available for purchase most of the work i do involves other apps so i wont use it often at all for those who don't need other apps it's a great thing to have i'll use it when i'm reading doing homework that's not online etc just wish i could do more
__label__1 cant share this list with others
__label__4 i really like this app so far its flexible ans very customizable the only thing i would add is either more categories the ability to add my own health and home are very broad categories so being able to have sub categories would be nice
__label__1 update noticed this app sending data to facebook when i set up my firewall no bueno
__label__1 terribly unethical company they bought the old task management system i was using gtask which i'd bought i lifetime subscription for then they took away the automatic sync feature making it useless and told me to download the premium tick tick version of the app never telling me that in doing so it would automatically opt me into a premium 3 a month subscription just to get the features i'd already bought how google allows this type of predatory behavior is beyond me
__label__4 so far so good i've only used the app for about a week i'll write a more in depth review soon
__label__3 only events sync would have to uninstall
__label__5 i am really appreciating these reminders and the ability to track my progress it has a lot of customizable options and it is easy to use highly recommend
__label__1 kept bugging out trying to register log in
__label__1 i lost all of my notes and it wouldn't accept my passcode to get in any more so i deleted it and installed it again then logged in and all of my stuff was gone please help i need it back
__label__4 just installed and trying out i'll update along with my experiences ui ux is pleasant and clear looks promising love the free full featured premium accessory features philosophy i'll pay later on to support development issues 1 can't change start date repetition of a habit if it'll break history data at least allow duplication 2 would expect scheduled days to be colored marked in the single habit calendar as future overview not just as achievement overview so far good job
__label__3 the app is useful on the phone and tablet i purchased it believing that it would also work on my smartwatch as displayed in the pictures you will only get reminders not a watch face the picture of the smartwatch is misleading either develop the watch face app or remove the picture of it
__label__3 been using todoist for some months now great app but need to make the google home experience better it would be great if it would ask to set a time and date and would i like to change the title of the context when it asked if you would like to change the context add a label and move to a different project
__label__4 definitely helps me to stay organized a little easier i personally use it in conjunction with an old fashioned pen and paper when i have a lot to get done in a day the only complaint i have with it is that i wish i could add additional reminders for the tasks instead of having to choose a reminder time based off of a due date i set other than that it's great and easy to use
__label__5 it's a good app it fuses the entertainment received in playing games with finishing chores which is pretty hard to pull off i'll recommend it to anybody who's trying a lot to change their life but easily succumbs to their desires
__label__1 no further improvement ui is kinda suck there are many better alternatives
__label__5 it's a delightful app that helps you keep on top of things personally i've found that you get as much as you put into it there are communities and challenges you can join with like minded people to help you achieve similar goals and their are seasonal events as well there are no adds no constant pop ups to buy gems and all features are equally helpful without the gems
__label__3 enjoying the app so far but the widgets are quite limiting you cannot use check lists in the widgets and sometimes they update rather weirdly i have also had ui bugs throughout but they haven't affected me too much overall good but just needs some tweaking to make it more solid that's not to say the service is bad just the mobile app
__label__3 good but i can't plant another type of trees i unlock trees but it can't be planted
__label__2 good app sadly it onlt worked for a day now it crashes instantly
__label__3 notification sound does not reflect the do not disturb option
__label__2 i really liked this until i realized that unfinished daily repeating tasks get marked as done whether you complete them or not the next day that makes it pretty useless for tracking tasks i need to do each week
__label__1 doesn't work error messages appear everywhere when i open the app
__label__4 pretty good for me but in the version i have i can't edit a task
__label__4 very good and gets the job done not the prettiest or well designed but certainly not the worst it's exactly how it's pictured and works fabulously too no crashing or issues here
__label__5 outstanding app i really tried some and this is the only one that helps me thanks
__label__3 stupid decision to remove timer
__label__3 easy to use simple functionality but well done
__label__4 good but needs to increase responsiveness to fingerprint takes time to unlock
__label__3 nice app
__label__3 there is a glitch in which it do not keeps track of your hours of study my target is 5 he's and if i studied for 1 hours than i add it and poof next day it shows 8930 hours
__label__3 repetitive tasks by completion date buggy been reporting it since 2017jan21 0759 hrs mt one rely asking how i sent in the concern which i tried to reply to and can't since then nothing great app terrible customer service
__label__4 just installed and am liking it so far i do wish there was a way to disable the quotes and better utilize that space to see more of my actual calendar also sub tasks would be very useful with those changes i might actually be able to downsize the apps i use
__label__1 unable to manage easily complicated
__label__4 it is simply one of the best productivity apps i've ever used i would just go and give a five star but i keep that last star cause living in my country i cant pay for the pro version and it kinda hurts that i see all the options i've missed still thanks for all the great free options available
__label__4 very helpful for day to day activities
__label__4 great and simple to use
__label__3 اغلب الميزات الهامة مدفوعة
"__label__3 uhmm i love the idea of this and enjoy using it at the same time it will 
be amazing if the app could offer to change the date format for ex 
actually it is month day year for me it's too weird i'll prefer something 
like year month day or day month year"
__label__2 android keep blocking the app from sending notifications i've re downloaded it and put an exception for it in the battery settings to work without interruption but nothing happens fix it
__label__3 size should be more large nd alarm needed
__label__5 after using todoist for 3 months i have considered it one of the most effective applications so far i have planned pretty everything using this app and could not deny to say that it has made my life a lot easier
__label__4 great app but annoying that it limits the number of lists you can make i can understand limiting shared lists on the free version but not regular ones functionally it's great though i would pay a one time fee to open the pro functions but not ongoing fees
__label__5 it's amazing i've started to being more organized after using timetune the best daily routine scheduler and reminder out there
__label__5 best one so fall love it more than keep notes i don't accidentaly loose menus etc and keeping track of sub lists is easier
__label__1 i reported about this app due to incorrect billing but noone answer me please return my money back because app took my money without my permission from my credit card
__label__3 there's this weird bug now where the screen dims and keeps showing the loading sign but you can still use the buttons please fix it
__label__4 love this app can guys add this features please 1 task priority tag red for important 2 more notifications options sometimes a single clicking sound is not enough wish you add alarm settings thanks
__label__5 forest is cute unobtrusive and has genuinely helped me in the transition from checking my phone to doing work a neat option is the ability to allow certain apps eg spotify to change music
__label__5 great good tracking with work and lifestyle
__label__3 why did you remove the 'open app' button from the widget this is very very annoying alao new tasks should be inserted on top not at the bottom
__label__4 great app still waiting for rtl support and sub folders please
__label__1 че то вступительного туториала не достаточно чтобы понять что делать
__label__3 after new update the app is crashing
__label__2 it was a good app until this most recent update now my widget doesn't work it's not syncing with my calendars i'm losing dates appointments
__label__4 excellent
__label__3 good
__label__5 great apps to organize and manage task and practice habbit
__label__4 i love the white noise feature it helps me stay focused on the task at hand
__label__5 great app using the pomodoro technique for focusing on missions the only thing i feel could be improved is allowing certain app to work using setting fir example i take online coarses on my phone and it would have been appreciated if the app wasn't considered to kill the tree
__label__1 wanted to try this but it doesn't seem to properly load images to create my character or load tutorial pages so i can't even continue from the create screen seems like it's broken
__label__3 i sadly had to uninstall this app as tgere was no general opt out option for direct marketing activity i could opt out of seeing personalised ads on this app i couldnt opt of my data being collected and combined with other sources and shared by all of their many advertising partners which for an app like this is just too invasive very saddened as the app does look really good
__label__5 just the best calender app been using it for years now and has all the features i need edit still the best
__label__2 it submits data to facebook found this via reviewing my off facebook activity please explain what is being shared uninstalling update why forest should send basic user data to facebook in the first place without an explicit consent correct me if i am wrong and you do provide a disclaimer on user data not all of the user base would want to be discoverable by pro users
__label__4 im really keen to use this app but the fact that it doesnt have an alarm bugs me a lot i tend to glance over things easily so an alarm that i have to stop after reading my next event will be incredibly helpful
__label__1 i like the app but i don't like rating apps and this one constantly nags you to do so with no option for it to stop even with the paid version so 1 star for being annoying after i've given them my money
__label__2 snooze doesn't work most of the times i end up forgetting missing task notification also i get notification on opening app instead of set time
__label__5 super app can keep tracks of different types of lists really well just one thing i wish they had the slide and add more things in a section even in the today tomorrow next week lists it would make the process faster than choosing the date in the calender again n again
__label__3 it seems like a really nice app but some functionality is broken when i add routine delete few items it merges in wrong way so some days become small while others have 34 hours
__label__3 when i first downloaded this app i loved it i enjoyed being able to see my day at a glance and everything was working fine for some reason the widget will not open the app for me anymore and i have no idea how to fix it i tried to uninstall the app and install it again and it still doesn't work anybody has any suggestions i'm open to them i use an android just to clarify the app itself is still working the widget is not
__label__1 this app has started to give me full screen pop up ads
__label__3 the app itself is a wonderful idea but the interface and functions need a lot of work in my opinion it took me so long to figure out how to set up a habit and i still don't understand how to use a task groups or steps i gave up and came back to my previous tracker because it was too complicated and time consuming to learn how to use this one anyway i will definitely retry after an update
__label__3 it's good and is useful only problem that lets it down is you have to upgrade to premium for it to do all the things it lists so that lets it down
__label__5 great free experience i can organize my to do lists into projects with subtasks it's almost like a sprint board for my life
__label__1 help the widgets are not working it always shows this message failed to display your tasks please restart app or add a new widget instead
__label__3 firstly thanks for your quick responses back i appreciate it ok so can you explain how to do it and where that is on the app because there's no tutorial for that part when i click on the other tabs that show the month stats and graph there's nothing indicating that the old schedule has been saved in an independent track and a new track created
__label__5 very good experience
__label__1 it was great until it disappeared very unhappy that i lost the app and all my info
__label__3 8 4 18 i'd give five stars if the weather showes in celsius other than that the app is absolutely great i ended up getting the paid version because i felt like the developers deserved it for making such a versatile scheduling tool 20 1 2020 the degree still does not change to c even if i change it on darksky fixing this would be very helpful especially that this has been noted almost 2 years ago
__label__4 such an easy to use task manager
__label__3 sound is not coming while the task is reminding how to get sound without sound while reminding is not useful please tell how to enable sound
__label__5 the experience is being great the app is really useful and beyond expectations
__label__2 so far i like it i thought there would be an option to sync your routine from the google calendar but apparently you can only sync the timeline the time tune staff has been very helpful and the app has alot of potential
__label__5 great app it's very quick to make notes
__label__3 came highly recommended tried it hate that i can't see the subtasks in a project why even and apparently that's a recent update well no one seems to like this feature or at least there should be an option to either have subtasks or not so hope you guys bring it back will use it then another observation most of the top notch features are unavailable to non premium users and not many are willing to subscribe seems a bit unfair one time payment would be great will that change
__label__3 i love this app the only thing that would make me like it more would be if the text wrapping on the sections made more sense sometimes the titles of my events get cut off and placed in odd spots in the sectors also i've found the colors are very limited when it looks into my calendar to match the color my calendar has for events it gets it wrong or doesn't have the color
__label__4 i looked at a lot of habit tracking apps and this one was the closest i've found to what i was looking for unless i missed how where to do them there are three things i wish i could do in the app first create custom categories subcategories especially under health second edit start dates without having to delete and retype to correct three have the ability to add notes
__label__3 i bought the premium version because the app said this would allow me to create routines for a bunch of specific dates but i cannot find this feature i'm a casual worker and my routines are based around different morning afternoon and night shifts that don't fall on any usual days of the week
__label__1 nothing but problems with this app first smart lists didn't work magically they started working the next morning and i thought everything was great now alexa sync stopped working it was working then it stopped it would sync to alexa if i added through any do but not if added through alexa voice in my efforts to fix it i disabled the skill and now i cant get it to re enable what a mess
__label__4 pretty good only issue i noticed is that if you undo claiming a reward that has its price increase each claim it can give you extra coins back aside from that a lifetime purchase option would be nice i try to avoid subscriptions where possible so i'm sticking with using this for free for now and an option to hide the parts that require a subscription instead of showing them but asking you to pay when you click them would be nice e g so the calendar doesn't even show up on the bottom
__label__5 love it in my wear device wish it had current weather daily weather on it even if paid feature best wear face for busy people
__label__5 nice planner that replaced paper planner i absolutely love it no more spending money on etsy for digital planners that do not give me notifications this one does
__label__1 i paid for the pro version and next day the data disappeared i installed the app again and it is no pro any more and the coins and trees had disappeared can you please fix that i did an export of the data and i have it on my msil but i don't know what to do can you please help
__label__5 perfect app to maintain your habits in good pace
__label__3 a blue flag
__label__1 this is a loser upgraded to premium without my permission for a free trial no option in the app to return to free option and i'm maxed out on tasks on the premium will delete before i pay for premium prior review migrated from wunderlist seamlessly much more cumbersome compared to wunderlist
__label__3 has its own strengths not as easy and intuitive as trello or wrike but can handle subtasking well
__label__4 great handy way to stay organized
__label__3 how to integrate toodledo tasks any help would be appreciated
__label__2 this thing is terrible i couldn't do anything i wanted
__label__5 overall it's pretty fantastic planting flowers and trees and not wanting them to die is good motivation to accomplish things without the phone sometimes there's an issue with notifications cancelling the timer but that doesn't happen as often anymore looking forward to seeing what new plants show up in the app next and the customer support team are great about replying if you have issues transitioning to a new phone
__label__3 i wish it wasn't conected to google callander which i don't like at all overall realy awesome concept wish i could use it if only it was a callander on its own
__label__2 it started strong then the ads were a bit much but it's free and i was thinking about buying it then events that are clearly on my google calendar stopped showing suddenly yes they re still on google and show on that app i don't like that app but i might be stuck with it i'm sorry this didn't last but i am glad the problem developed before i bought it
__label__2 no adding option for the time
__label__3 great but over half the time when i edit a task it changes the year to the 1960s even though it says 2019 when selected
__label__3 i don't like a widget with the monthly calendar plus events plus task that monthly calendar is too big and unnecessary i would like to have the option to watch a widget just with the date the events and tasks something symple as if we can watch it in the application the same would better in the widget when they change it i'll give the 5
__label__5 this is truley an amazing app it helps me study clean and workout without being tempted to get on my phone i suggest silencing your phone while using this app so you arent tempted to kill your tree thank you for this app and keep up the good work
__label__5 good for food shopping
__label__1 need to make more convinient i just set 3 time alarm for the task but it didnt work
__label__1 can you make it exactly like wunderlist i work every day with wunderlist and 'to do' momentarily doesn't help my needs four example when a chose to have a list for today i have to drag them from bottom to up they don't go themselves and when i click something finish it still stay there there is no delimitation line if you will do all of this later than i retrieve my word till then you should let wunderlist open thank you
__label__5 אפליקציה פשוטה ברורה ועונה על הצרכים כיף להשתמש בה עדי
"__label__3 it's really good i would appreciate it even better if i could save tasks 
offline"
__label__3 great concept but there are numerous issues that i found right off the bat the main one for me was the fact that once you pick a subject for your journey you can never go back and change that i mean there are multiple journey subjects to choose from and maybe i want to focus on one aspect of my life at a time the app treats life like a game after all and most games allow you to start over with different settings starting over in this game requires you to uninstall the app reinstall the app and then create a brand new account kind of silly and frustrating to boot check out the level life up app instead it has a much better platform
__label__3 i would give this app 5 stars but i am beyond frustrated with how slow it is to open i pay the subscription for premium and i love all the options in the app but it literally takes 5 to 10 minutes for the app to open unless there is a notification in my notification bar that i can open the app with this would be annoying even with a free app but to pay for a slow app that takes ages to open is ridiculous in the 2 or 3 years that i've used it this has never been fixed with any upgrade
__label__2 i love the ideia but the executation is not good i want to put reminders for every day and know what i need to do in a clock like that this app needs his own callendar and clock for we customize without messing up anything on the original apps in the phone this need a every day reminder routine and stuff
__label__5 great application
__label__2 dont this app have repeat task feature
__label__3 doesn't beat most others in it's free version and too costly in the paid
__label__5 it is an amazingly helpful app i am currently a year 11 student and this has helped tremendously boost my productivity i have seen improvements not only in my results but also me as a person as i lost lots of my bad habits and gained good ones highly recommend to anybody who wants to improve themselves non academic academic
__label__3 the app looked very promising but there were too many upgrade to premium notifications when initially clicking through the app from what i saw i probably would have paid for a year if i was able to try out the fill app first instead i got what felt like being kicked in the face by upgrade notifications for these reasons 3 stars and lost buisness
__label__3 scary it's a great program haven't put enough into it to see if it has the gtasks sync issues but i don't see a backup option i've put information into apps then years later they change formats and all data is lost this can never happen i need to know that i can always access a given version of the program and local data will always work todo and microsoft onenote burned me microsoft is extorting buy office 365 and we'll allow you access to your prior data
__label__3 looks good but lack of dark mode kills it for my phone i can't stand any app that's mostly bright b white went with liferpg instead
__label__1 full screen ads you can't skip every time you add or edit an event
__label__5 needs a recipe section and separate lists for different members of family
__label__2 this app is a good idea and i like the fact that it is very good to start healthy habits an get organized but yet i could not do anything even with the little tutorial at the beginning this app was no help to me all i recommend is that the app has to be a bit more self explanatory i did not know how to do anything
__label__3 the big cons to this app dailies tab always shows all of my weekly duties instead of the daily ones i change this in the filter but once i reopen the app it switches back to showing everything what's the point of a filter when the app doesn't save it galaxy note 8 also why is there no dark mode my eyes are screaming at night
__label__3 this app has great potential but is not there yet example if a task repeats but without notification then you manually mark it completed the task is shown as completed should advance to the next scheduled date instead it is showing up the next day as past due but if the task repeats with notification then on the due date time the system instantly advances the due date but does not show the task as completed so you have no record of the task due today i have overlooked many not good
__label__3 cannot show all task of different accounts in widgets
__label__4 could have more types of priorities
__label__2 why s the app keeping shut down a sound all time even i paid for it already still got this problem please fix it i love this app
__label__4 apk बन न क व च र नय ह पर उपय ग करन म कठ न म न जम ट और प ड भ
__label__3 it seems so cool and i wanted to use it as soon as possible but it wont even let me log in it takes 1second to load and then nothing happens
__label__3 nice idea but the problem is that i tried to see what happens if i close the app and use other stuff like games it said that the tree would wither but when i come back after playing the tree is still growing is this normal
__label__3 it's good but complicated a bit
__label__2 i really think the math is off on this logically it does not make sense that if you have a good day your percentage of success goes up by 1 but if you have a bad day it goes down 20 that really defeats the point of motivation and self forgiveness
__label__1 there is no time table this app is fake
__label__5 helps me to focus and its fun to grow the forest once i started i found that my studying and sleep has gotten better
__label__3 the app is really useful one must download it but it just have one problem that we need to refresh the widget all the time to see current time unless we don't refresh the widget we cannot check the upcoming event through widget if you can solve this this is one of the best app for daily use and surely you'll get more pro version users of this app thank you
__label__3 easy to use intuitive has issues to share the kist woth somebidy if one of the use is using a school or work account non collaborative
__label__3 seemed like a good app but doesn't always show your plans it's linked to my calender and i've added quite a few things for the month but it only shows on this app once and then disappears next time i look at it
"__label__2 a core function missing is the ability to disable a routine daily 
occurrence for a specific day for example i usually exercise from 6pm to 
8pm every day so i created an event that happens every monday to friday 
today is a thursday and due to an unexpected occurrence i can't exercise 
today i wanted to change that my 6 8pm block of time just today but can 
only do so by deleting the event for every monday to thursday to clear my 
timeline makes no sense to clear that block of time and need to re create 
that exercise block for all the other monday to fridays if something 
unexpected happens at 6pm next friday i'll have to delete it alll and 
recreate all over again after just to clear my timeline if you get this 
core feature right then the app would be complete"
__label__3 on my s9 it's started giving notifications some minutes after the event it actually states it e g 4 minutes ago the time delay varies i hear the notifications announce on time on my huawei tablet
__label__5 this is honestly the best app to help stay focused you can choose the amount of time you want to study or do homework for and it honestly works you feel the need to let the tree grow i 100 recommend this to anyone who wants to stay focused
__label__3 unfortunately tic tick is better app for me
__label__1 had accumulated 5 habits that lasted 17 days and counting now using a different app this pathetic app that i paid premium for would not sync check internet connection every damn time i paid for the damn app sadly probably past my refund day
__label__4 great app to plan out your weekly schedule especially for a college student however i wish it would show the amount of time being spent on each activity on the widget it shows it when you go into the app but that's less convenient and helpful if you want to do a quick check to see how much time you have for today's lunch break
__label__4 neat but i don't put that much stuff on my calendar looking for more of a scheduling tool for everyday routines don't want to add all that stuff to my calendar
__label__5 simple and efficient app
__label__3 the last update caused annoying hesitation delays when working with tasks in task view
__label__5 something great
__label__2 no easy way to import export tasks in a compatible format e g google tasks
__label__2 free version only supports 5 habits which is basically nothing
__label__1 good app but does not respect do not disturb mode and keeps waking me up every night edit the issue is fixed giving the deserved 5 stars edit2 this is not fixed after all somehow this app not only not respects the do not disturb mode but also manages to send notifications one hour after i fell asleep today it sounded around 4 am
__label__3 need a cleaner gui
__label__4 it's a great app for tracking habits so far i find that purchasing the premium app has been worth every penny
__label__2 can't put cute stickers on them no cuteness on phone
__label__3 experiência muito boa mas tem muito a ser feito
__label__3 i have a big problem with this app daily routine doesn't repeat unless i complete it but somtimes i really could not complete it then ist stop why
__label__3 i really liked the app but couldn't find a way to integrate it with my google tasks which is a most for me it is a very complete app i would even consider a premium subscription if it was a one time thing and not a yearly monthly system i will check this again in a couple of months to see if it has improved
__label__3 this app would do better with a calculator tat adds subtracts shopping list columns with totals also tabs swipes for delete retrieve update 2 16 20 1 you can't edit actual item on a list like change it's name 2 and you can't see or do a running sub total add or subtract price totals what good is a list tat when u put the price of a item your task list can't be more helpful when creating a cost grocery list or whatever like hardware store items list so i deleted
__label__2 app deleted my tasks out of no where as well as the app seems to be bloated with features needs to be more sleek and refined i dont believe the audience for a to do list app is looking for anything with a lot of features
__label__5 i'm in skyrim nah but all jokes aside this app also has the benefit of suggesting healthy habits which would be good for a lot of people
__label__3 the widget in one line mode could shorten the time spans so they don't take as much space also it doesn't seem to sync well between multiple phones with tasks 10 22 2018 edit not sure how else to respond to the dev but it's task syncing not calendar syncing that's the issue 10 23 2018 edit both devices have task syncs active and are just the main google account
__label__5 marvellous makes a game out of everyday life helps you organise your tasks while feeding stats about the progress you consider important and the gold xp reward punishment system gives some type of extra motive brilliant i say
__label__3 nice widgets and user interface i really wanted to use this app for the moments daily review but all lists are included in the daily review with no option to hide lists this made the moments feature feel clunky and unusable
__label__4 helpful not like wunderlist which was the best todo i ever used please add a feature to show my repeated daily tasks in my day section automatically without adding it manually
__label__3 edit reverted to old version or something and issues are back edit issue fixed and new update is great seems like you actually passed the issue along instead of making complaining subscriber have to repeat the complaint in email huge fan of habitica used it for years it was called habitrpg when i started only to do list app i have stuck to encourages you to build good habits in a fun way community built no ads worth subscribing to support the app
__label__1 paid for premium sync does not work publisher does not reply started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem going to try to get my money back nice app if you don't care about backups or syncing between devices or customer support switched to goalify and finding them extremely responsive
__label__4 it is exelent sometimes a little buggy when deleting some tasks that are daily
__label__4 works lovely
"__label__2 while it certainly wasn't expensive it was a waste of money in the fact 
that i found this app to do very little more than any calendar after 
reading the faq it says it's more than a calendar how especially since 
adding anything is done in the same way you create a calendar event the 
 routine function is a missed opportunity in that i think it will help me 
establish a morning routine for myself but in reality it's about creating 
calendar events that repeat a slightly expanded component of any free 
calendar our there when i think of tuning my time spent i'm thinking 
better organization for smaller tasks then find myself spending an hour 
setting 1 minute events for myself that i was never actually notified about 
lol what irony unfortunately it was not time or money well spent"
__label__3 the prices for this app is abit stupid when i can find apps that do the same thing for free 26 should give me life not everyone is rich
__label__4 moving from the wonderful wunderlist to to do app was easy and now some other feature are added among which i like add to my day and tasks
__label__2 why do notes dissapear i pun something today and tomorrow it doesn't show up at all to answer 1 yes 2 local 3 i go in the app month view click on day box write details hour all day save then it shows up in the app and widget for a few hours and then it's gone 4 i have a stable internet connection what should i do
__label__4 i really love this app but notifications are not working at all even after i allow all the permissions so i'm not able to use this app
__label__3 not as useful as wunderlist yet would prefer to have a tab for the week not just day that way i can anticipate also wish items would show up in my calendar
__label__1 just they copied google calendar and charging on top of that google calendar so far better
__label__5 now it works
__label__5 go ahead and get the app it is a great tool
__label__3 great app as it really helped me to focus on my schoolwork however lately my tree has been killed by calendar alerts though i have not switched to other apps while the tree is growing i have turned on the advanced detection option within the setting of the app but the problem still exists
__label__3 not giving 5 stars because of the following reasons 1 it's very annoying when you enter into a habit page and you swipe down to scroll down to see stats but it switches to another habit page please fix this it's counter intuitive 2 no method to edit the habits online on pc or mac limits the app to smart phones only otherwise it's a good app does what it is supposed to do
__label__3 you have not made it possible as far as i can see to assign certain tasks to separate people inside a list when i go shopping with my husband he has his assigned items and i have my assigned items if you have made it possible to do this then please let me know how to access it i am not as happy with this app as i was with wunderlist and i'm sorry to hear that you're getting rid of the perfect app
__label__5 updated to 5 stars disregard previous rating
__label__5 great app let's me track habits and keeps me motivated
__label__3 needs to have matching theme with phone i e dark mode with dark theme light mode with light theme
__label__1 has no sign in option only export and the file won't open so unless you have an it friend you lose your file which meant all the stuff i put in tasks has gotten lost if the developer revolves this is i will edit this review
__label__4 just wish the app would sync so i can use it on my new phone excellent otherwise thank you
__label__3 bigger fonts at widget plz connect one drive with to do outlook calendar too
__label__3 offline support at least make an offline list feature
__label__4 greatly improved comment from me much better than a year ago most updated lead to improvement wish the ' want an annual subscription
__label__3 should not need to tap a notification alert each time i add a new item should be by default like almost every other app in testing it has only not worked once could be great
__label__3 i like the concept but it don't work i am able to go on facebook even if the tree is growing even now i have a tree growing as i type i really like the idea but it don't work on my phone
__label__3 love the app but i just purchased the pro version and my generate your personal flower event gift won't appear in the trees i can use it says i still need to purchase it but then i can't purchase it either because the store saya i already have
__label__3 fun and easy
__label__2 edit initially gave it 4 5 stars the app itself still works fine but the sync stopped working about a year ago that's the main reason i paid for the premium version i messaged the developer about it and never heard back wonder if it's been abandoned by the developer
__label__3 cant wait to try it
__label__1 i have canceled for the subscription when at the first time i used anydo do i still have to pay i was try for free trial for the first i using this app
__label__5 awesome
__label__5 i'm migrated user from wunderlist hasn't found any issue with this app i use this from mobile and pc's browser i can say that the sync is fast very like it
__label__2 i love the ease of the application and the setup i don't like that the way they send you reminders that are sometimes rude or shame based it doesn't make me want to try any harder when i get scolded for not fulfilling my goals positive encouragement as the best way
__label__2 it's useful but it doesn't fully sync the events tasks and notes between devices it's a huge inconvenience besides that i still love the app
__label__3 from the reviews this app sounds awesome unfortunately i can't use it because i need an app that syncs with google tasks
__label__5 excellent app helps thru the day to get things done great app
__label__5 easily the best task manager app out there while the rpg aspect is a huge plus the user is able to fully customize pretty much every little bit of the app to make it better suit their habits or soon to be habits
__label__2 so i paid for the premium version but the thing is that i cannot sign up when i go to the settings as nothing shows up hope you can fix this
__label__4 i like it also i would like like a wedget but for the block screen then you don't need to open the phone only activate the screen in order to see the next task in your calendar
__label__5 i have gone between this and the google calendar app i like this because it expands the features that are missing in google calendar
__label__4 edit i use comments to add reminders about what i'm specifically planning to do to complete each task day by day like grocery lists and assignment titles i would really like to be able to add comments for just one cycle of the routine and have them disappear after the week restarts i thought it might be useful to have this function on the timeline page rather than the routine edit screen which seems to only be useful for permanent comments i hope this makes sense
__label__2 widget request please could you add a feature that pushes undone tasks to the top of the widget or an option that removes done tasks from the widget good job on the app otheriwise i'll repurchase if you can add this love the snooze function
__label__3 i have been using this app for a while really trying to get to grips with it but i've come to conclude that it's not me if you feel like you need less complexity in your life them this probably isn't for you as this adds a new system that you have to get to grips with and plus the gamification aspect can be quite destracting and finnecky i think if this were to ever be useful for me it would need a separate environment for tasks habits and dailies
__label__3 is just me or did this app kind of just get more complicated after the last update i'm not sure what it is about it now that i don't appreciate but i really liked the last version much better it seems too simplistic and it's still buggy
__label__1 i was excited to try this app but like many others have said the customization screen doesn't work let me know when it's fixed and i'll update and hopefully be able to start using it
__label__3 ok it's sending hundreds of notifications with no end after an update yesterday
__label__3 does not work on galaxy watch it would be so perfect if it would the app is the best though but how can an app built for planning and reminding not work with something as basic as a smartwatch makes no sense
__label__5 its amazing for both daily routines and for events to put on a calendar and it's very intuitive so no much n thead about it at all also being free it offers alot and more with prob but i use free only
__label__1 todoist has 1 big flaw that really prevents me to use it well if you schedule a task to be repeated daily and do it few minutes after midnight it will skip a day overdue tasks that are completed should add the repeat time to the previous date not be reset to the day they are marked compete
__label__1 worst
__label__1 i deleted a list but i still get alarms for one of the tasks in that list even after restarting my phone
__label__4 it was amazing i just didn't have the time to set it up all the way
__label__3 just started using it i am more use to wunderlist but surely i am going to love using to do and it will be great
__label__3 i just wish you could use this offline even if wouldn't record progress just make it accessible offline
__label__2 a chore to figure out
__label__4 easy simple cheerful effective
__label__2 i really want to love this app but it won't even let me select pm so its constantly telling me its past the due date which makes the app very useless to me
__label__5 it's awesome
__label__2 i used it twice so far and i really like it except from today i havnt been able to open it it just keeps closing everytime i try to open it
__label__3 useful easy to use and fulfil my needs but i still didn't experience it's use in sharing or groups
__label__3 i can't be the only one multitasking therefore i don't have time to figure out a basic program i put in a picture and it was so tiny i put in my tasks yet some are timeless some are daily and there was powerlifting i'm physically crippled
__label__3 looks very good but i would love to see cloud sync for example with google tasks
__label__5 that's a great app i have suggestion which would make this app perfect for me make option to delay all today's events for 1h or any other period of time great anyway
__label__5 i loved the idea and downloaded to try it this app is helping me a lot thank you btw i suggest you to do an ios version i have friends who want to use it too edit i'm sure it'll be a huge success there too
__label__3 useless have to pay a subscription to be reminded no thank you honestly a once off fee is fair but a continued yearly fee i can see why these guys partnered with facebook and mark suckerberg to suck your wallet i gave it 3 stars because it is a well made app
__label__3 love it
__label__3 nice app want tothank bro who created this
__label__5 amazing app i use it frequently and it is a life saver as my memory can be bad sometimes thank you for the awesome app
__label__3 good
__label__5 intuitive flexible and free from nagging ads
__label__2 seems like it could be fun i just had a hard time getting into it
__label__5 moved here from wunderlist after trying other apps this is so clean and easy to use and does everything i needed and more my fiance and i can now both keep track of the grocery list so glad it has the ability to share with others
__label__1 hyper masculine tone is very off putting and irritating hint to developers women try to change habits too at least give us the option of just having hints in our own words
__label__5 my only complaint was that i purchased the app thinking that i could always use the in app currency to plant real world trees it only allows you to plant 5 but otherwise it's a useful app
__label__5 it's really helpful app and it makes you day easy and it reminds you in time i recommend it to poeple who wants to be seccsesful in thier livies and great mindsets
__label__4 very cool app only thing i found is that when i update and remove an event from my calendar the widget doesn't update the event stays in the widget also wish it had a setting to show battery percentage still like the app though
__label__3 i really need a feature to work properly and that is the calender widget once i fail to complete a task today it sounds show up in the next days list in the calender but it doesn't please add some option to fix this then it'll be worth the 5 stars the rest is good
__label__3 a to do list is a really clever way to look into progress you have made in a day so it is not just about completing the task it is about looking into the progress you have made by glancing at completed tasks you don't get default features to see the competed tasks to enable that you have to go into settings and enable that and if you are not interested in compiled tasks anymore you can't just delete those tasks for that you have to select each task individually and then delete it
__label__3 how about letting us pick from a custom color palette for each list the supplied ones are insipid and limited also sharing my wife and i keep getting this message when trying to share lists not all of them just some go figure unavailable list it looks like this list isn't available try contacting the person who invited you err okay then what bringing over shared lists from wunderlist is a disaster utterly out of sync
__label__2 needed too many permissions before i could test it out so just uninstalled
__label__3 great for keeping track of things
__label__4 very nice working space but the display of things can be a bit nicer
__label__3 don't get any reminders for the goals inspite of setting it a number of times
__label__1 mainly reminder function not working properly
__label__3 i used to love this app but since my phone updated it no longer works i recently uninstalled and re installed i hope it works or i'll have to find something new
__label__3 needed sync tasks color code events and for goodness' sake speed up this is extremely slow
__label__2 loved this app for years the new full screen ads with no skip option is ridiculous and will likely drive me away i understand the need for ads but this is too far and i have no need for any of the pro features so i will not pay for it when i can use a different app for free that doesn't block my productivity i used to recommend this app to anyone who asked but now i won't
__label__4 pros really good app in terms of productivity and usability love how it's possible to colour code and label tasks eg personal work university etc love that it syncs with my google calendar plus i love the app's ui i also like the focus option cons i think the focus option should be more like the forest app and not allow you to go away from the screen tree otherwise the tree dies i also think you should be able to add attachments to events like you can with tasks
__label__5 i've been using this app for a week and so far it is great it has really helped me hold myself accountable for habits that i want to break or start way better than i thought i never end up liking self help apps i also never write reviews give the one a chance
__label__2 not in sync with my google account bad in regards to automatically getting what i planned and plus i can't use it when i am using my pc but thumbs up for this sectogragh the idea is brilliant please work on updates because very soon i might not use it if i still have to re enter all my days task and activities it should be able to get data from my google account and i should be able to use it on pc pc is really perfect use for this kind of app
__label__5 it is one of the best apps i've ever had it's very applicable and useful and also easy to use i love it
__label__4 good app and really helpful with time management and staying organized
__label__5 functional does everything i want it to do versatile and allows for both habits and one off tasks the only improvement i want to make is changing the colours of the completion status icons
__label__1 most of my google calendar events doesn't appear in the sectograph app if i try to delete some events which is appeared it cannot remove in the app also i prefer if the app has own calendar so that events that ill creat might able show easier
__label__1 not working
__label__1 it keeps showing java lang runtimeexception unable to start receiver com ticktick task activity widget appwidgetscrollable java lang nullpointerexception attempt to invoke virtual method 'boolean java lang boolean booleanvalue ' on a null object reference at android app activitythread handlereceiver activitythread java 3421 at android app activitythread access 1300 activitythread java 200 at android app activitythread h handlemessage activitythread java 1684 at android os handler dis
__label__5 great job
__label__5 took me soooooo long to find a calendar app where the reminders actually pop up over what i'm don't and bother me i've been using this app for about a year now and it's a true life saver i run a business and have 7 kids i have between 10 20 reminders every day this app truly works amazingly not like others that failed to remind me and i was screwing things up all the time loooooove business calendar
__label__2 i think i could really like this app except i upgraded to paid and still have ads and the search function does not search notes it will be hard to find info saved in notes if you cant search
__label__4 i migrated to this app a few months ago from wunderlist which i absolutely loved im still getting used to this version and the microsoft integration as i have been a gsuite user for a few years now while i love this app i took one star for the myday list i get the developers want you to be more intentional but i plan my day the night before so this list is useless to me and with the due dates not auto loading in it also makes it difficult nice thought but does not work for night planners
__label__2 is a pretty good app but it's got a pretty big issue which is how is it going to keep track of how many things i've done every day if it counts the current activity as if it was done the last corresponding day
__label__4 best app for daily routine but there are some issue such as you can get lot of coins and increase your level to infinit though settings you should improve that because some one donot get motivated for doing task when you knew that you can change your level
__label__3 would be nice if you could attach image or some file to task and event update more than a year passed still no progress on image file attachment feature although app is getting certain amount of updates feels like it's time to check out the competition
__label__2 very confusing when problems occur the resolution isnt made clear
__label__5 the user interface is very intuitive so far i love the up if the helps me stick to a schedule for a few days i'll buy the pro version keep up the good work
__label__3 the lines on the to do page makes me wanna touch those to start typing but only the ' ' addition is permitted
__label__1 don't buy the primium subscription the app does not sync as it says also support never answer
__label__3 seems like it may be a good app but i uninstalled as soon as i found out you have to pay a monthly fee for recurring reminders which is developed once and costs nothing to maintain
__label__3 you have not made it possible as far as i can see to assign certain tasks to separate people inside a list when i go shopping with my husband he has his assigned items and i have my assigned items if you have made it possible to do this then please let me know how to access it i am not as happy with this app as i was with wunderlist and i'm sorry to hear that you're getting rid of the perfect app
__label__1 my mobile is getting switched off after installing it worked fine on 1st day of installing please fix it
__label__2 after i bought a new tree or switch from the regular one none of my trees die when i switch apps this is disappointing
__label__5 love it so far excited for the coming soon items i use a paper planner bc digital planners never seem to have the layout i want but so far this seems to be a great replacement
__label__1 how can one trust an app that is supposed 2 help organize when u misspell organize
__label__5 great app if you keep it to a short list of achievable habits fun to use good statistics for tracking progress you can input things retroactively if you forget at the time has dark theme customization options when it comes to tasks skills and characteristics lightweight easy to use overall i don't think i have any complaints it delivers what if says it does well no more no less tldr love it
__label__2 so far so good bit expensive having to purchase a yearly basis to access basic functions as color tags and what comes with it translation to greek is not fluent for the price tag annually i would apprechiate developers look closer at them will give it a try before committing on purchasing it per year on a positive note love the widget using however nova launcher current rating will change based on the experience
__label__5 gooood
__label__3 i loved tt and paid for premium but sooner or later their reminder will let you down you can't count on it unfortunately and it's not because of android but due to a flaw in the app if a reminder pops up and you accidentally tap somewhere else in the screen or if you're busy now then the reminder disappears and never reminds you again until you manually find this task again in the list and set a new date for the reminder
__label__1 i thought upgrading and paying the 8 fee would allow me to use all of the functions of this app it does not i haven't been able to sync any of my devices absolutely will not let me add an event this was a waste of time and money if i can't add my schedule on my lap top version then there's no point to this app plus there's no support or anyone to contact to help trouble shoot or credit me back
__label__3 i am not satisfied with this app because circles used for completing the habits look very dirty
__label__2 this app doesn't show all the activities of my google calender so to me the app is quite useless i even checked all the available calendars to make sure the settings were right however the concept seems to be great for people with a busy agenda but since it has no use i unfortunately had to delete this app
__label__4 it is all for me about habits i wasn't able to work on it but in this one it is so helpful just i have one issue i don't know if didn't find it or it is not at the program that if u need to remind your self more than one time in the day i just remind my self once a day i don't know if it in the app or not
__label__1 isnt this basically a calendar that is for all phones
__label__2 ver y often the application does not open you sen question and ask what is happening and you get no replied roger j sanchez from miami
__label__3 i like this app but i give only 3 stars because i am unable to bye new plants whenever i go to store to bye new plants it always load loading never stops and so i was always unsuccessful to bye new plants please make any solution for this problem so then i can give you 5 stars
__label__4 great app but i still need a feature that the app should have a custom notification sound selection option so that i can know that notification has come from this app
__label__2 when you switch the language you get wierd bug that your app is half in english half in selected language
__label__1 not user friendly wunderlist was much better i have several different lists and liked the all view from wunderlist where i could see all the different tasks from all of my lists on one screen and i could easily move tasks between different lists now there is no all view and i have to open each individual list separately and go back and forth to see everything i also can't move a task to another list i'd have to open one list and copy the text then open the other list and paste
__label__3 it consumes too much 1 3 of the battery otherwise it is great
__label__5 i was a very big fan of wunderlist and this replacement has a lot more functionality and is still easy to use
__label__3 over the years the platform has become stagnant i was a huge proponent of habitica using it for a few years and even paying for a subscription to support development but development beyond bug fixes never happened it's a good tool with a potent gamification component but they've failed to continue to make it engaging and interesting and certainly not worth paying to support
__label__3 satisfactory
__label__1 unable to understand the planner
__label__3 i wish it had a widget but i love it otherwise
__label__3 it's not clear how much it cost the premium account also every time i try to go premium i get a message saying the in app billing are not available on this device i've always do in app purchasing and it was the first time that i got this issue really disappointed
__label__2 nawww sorry your yearly subscription price scared me off by the time i've subscribed to every app i consider helpful i'm spending waaay too much i would have liked it but i have other much more important bills to pay the low stars is due to the price and there's no point in coming back to justify it because it'll still be too much for me edit i know that i can use it for free but then i'd still have to put up with ads surprisingly i don't like ads i still consider your sub too much
"__label__4 cool app seems to have all i need at this point my only 2c would be that 
the widget weekly view should have the option to see the 7 days ahead 
rather than the current week if it's a friday i don't really care what i 
did on monday i wanna know what's happening next monday"
__label__5 i love all of the features especially the lists and the stickers
__label__1 no instructions i can't even get started because there are no instructions i put in list title groceries and that's it when i try to make a list it asks for sub titles won't let me even start a list just sends ya in circles delete delete
__label__3 great app only problem is that whenever i set reminders for the task i set i don't really receive them would definitely rate 5 stars if this problem is fixed
__label__4 love it some pay features are annoying
__label__2 should tell the cost first
__label__1 can't add new tasks to top of list clearly no one in microsoft actually use to do if you did you'd know that this is an extremely important and basic feature otherwise you add a task and it disappear to the end i don't believe one can efficiently use a to do list without this feature
__label__5 it's one of the well thought app which has been developed i think it has user friendly and very nice features to manage our work i would definitely recommend this to anyone who what's to manage their work best thing is no advertisement or any other annoying thing to distract
__label__2 i wish they had a chart on where we could see the other participant's timing this could inspire us
__label__5 it does a beautiful job at helping you use their app through their website and other tutorials it makes you soooo much more likely to stick to using it than other apps
__label__4 very useful and functional
__label__3 stop looking at users as cash cows i will be uninstalling this and moving to a different app which is as good and does not nag this is quite a good to do app other than that it too often comes up with prompts to upgrade to the premium subscription based version since when have customers disrespectfully greedily been treated as cash cows it used to be apps were 5 at most for a lifetime of use but now they are greedy and arrogant enough to want 5 or thereabouts per month i wud pay a one off
__label__1 there are better and simple other apps which provide automatic online sync or backup feature like micr_oso_ft's to do and many other why people think this app easy it's not i donated on this app and wasted
__label__1 this is terrible compared to wunderlist i use wunderlist to sync my family's repeating chores i was used to clicking 'today' and having everything there and in folders that needed to be done past and present now i have to choose what i do everyday also if i skip a task and want to reset it to today so it can repeat in 2 weeks it retains the day so repeats in less than two weeks and the folders what's the point in having folders if you can't sort by them in any list is there an alternative
__label__5 amazing app it's helping me so much developing my discipline and have my to do list always on point thanks ever so much guys
__label__1 keeps failing to repeat some daily tasks i've had to remake the same tasks several times because they just won't stick for some reason sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't it's a complete gamble now it's more work just to figure out what tasks need done than it is to do the tasks themselves uninstalling this app is more maintenance than my daily chores
__label__3 carry forward of task is amazing strength of the app liked it
__label__1 free options are hard to find and bundled with pro version can't open free without ad for pro version literally clicked one thing after opening your app for the first time and it instantly went to a pop up of the pro version i'm not going to navigate your app to find only the free options that are given to me bundled in with the pro versions when there are other apps that are available that never mention pro version which i downloaded
__label__3 i am a paid subscriber i love the to do list the calendar is limited and leaves much to be desired for me but i didn't get it for the calendar much better alternatives on that front
__label__3 like the concept but tech support cannot get rid of ads and popups tried over several months but they are gone a short while then return the response lag and language issues are frustrating this changed my review and i removed the app
__label__2 the app worked fine for awhile but all the events i added were simply gone this morning this was a frustrating experience
__label__1 another update but the stats section is still totally useless and buggy week starts with sunday even i changed to monday on a sunday the stats resets and stays empty for the whole day to update the progress i have to exit and enter the app several times
__label__4 i love this app only thing that annoys me is how marking a task as complete in one device doesn't dismiss notifications on the others
__label__3 decent simple just a bit too simple for me i thought the percentages counted for task progress s though it were a whole project unfortunately it seems to only relate to habits i'd like to see subtasks and then percentage competed at least the habit statistics are clear and aesthetically pleasing
__label__2 i had added a routine by default it took a date almost 8 days ahead from today's date i m unable to change the date it's frustrating
__label__3 this app has great potential but is not there yet example if a task repeats but without notification then you manually mark it completed the task is shown as completed should advance to the next scheduled date instead it is showing up the next day as past due but if the task repeats with notification then on the due date time the system instantly advances the due date but does not show the task as completed so you have no record of the task due today i have overlooked many not good
__label__3 forever landscape why can't i ever get this app to rotate to portrait mode it's never been able to do this even after downloading it on other phones way too annoying to have to deal with for me to deem it a useful app at least for me
__label__1 i created a task for picking up groceries and set it to a specific day why in the world would the default setting in this app be to override my do not disturb setting and ring vibrate at 5 o'clock in the morning on that day even though i like the apps functionality i would never recommend it to anyone with these default settings
__label__2 do you love apps that design their experience to be poor unless you pay ongoing subscriptions for static feature sets that make the experience barely tolerable do you prefer having money siphoned from your account over and over again instead of paying a single small fee once for an app like we used to see then this is the app for you add one more debit to your bank account they hope you'll forget about and statistically speaking you will for a stagnant app you'll forget about in a week
__label__1 just an unwanted extension of calendar
__label__3 i can't arrange my habits in the order i want i have to choose from preselected options like alphabetical
__label__4 love this app but it only lets you keep track of only 5 habits at once for more you have to buy premium but other than that its great
__label__3 it works it just hard
__label__3 thanks for your comments why does google calendar sync perfectly and bc not when all on the same account i think some while ago possibly due to an update this stopped syncing reliably either regularly or even when sync button pressed in business calendar menu deleting an event on this samsung galaxy phone sometimes forces a sync sync is important as i use this with google calendar on desktop previously wrote easy to use and great that i can copy appointments
__label__5 this app has been great for me especially to track daily goals i set for myself it shows me the days i have succeeded and the days ive fallen short i can see a history of my success and setup reminders to make sure i don't miss a daily goal i've been using the app for a little over a month now and highly recommend it to anyone who has daily goals they want to rack and be successful with
__label__2 i love this app but my premium service doesn't seem to follow me i sent multiple emails to get it resolved however i'm only getting autogenerated response emails
__label__1 wunderlist better format more user friendly
__label__3 not really what i'm looking for looks like it's more time consuming than just getting to work
__label__3 this is really a great app i'm just finding difficult to put tasks in home widgets could you tell me how to do this
__label__2 app maybe okay but its very confusing to understand i have tried about 30 min to set a simple task for a particular date but it doesnt show up anywhere so i will keep looking for a more simplyfied app sorry
__label__3 i like the new jump day and insert gap options and the advice delay dialog for multiple activities the undo feature is a great addition as well i'm really disappointed with the new look and that vertical scrolling through makes it so much harder to use it's easier to start changing the wrong day since the current activity is not highlighted in any way and starting time is not that clear as before also those activity free time blocks take too much space yet there is not enough space horizontally for the text and a lot of the additional tags aren't visible i'd prefer a more compact look it would take a lot of time getting used to this
__label__5 the user interface of this app is high level and the way in which i can see my task is awesome but i think there must be some options in which i could be able to make quick notes of those although there is that option but it must be enhanced so that the user interface would be augmented
__label__1 new update has ruined the app the reminder option is no longer available with ringtones why the heck should i keep this app now in my phone deleting
__label__3 c'est très bien mais ça devrait être moins lourd en daya
__label__3 widget seriously needs fixing screen real estate is important and your widget is huge wastes so much space please set up options for controlling text size in it try to remove dead space the title of the app since it's unnecessary this is almost a deal breaker for me also small request is there any way you can change the task example to anything but the name alex like someone instead because honestly it triggers me pretty bad abuser thanks for considering my comments
__label__2 weak and underdeveloped platform don't expect support to treat you like a person this is a company that just wants your money and then to forget about you
__label__4 very good excellent features especially for the subtask the option to add step for achieving the task subtask kindly add a calendar feature to get an overview of what is ahead also some ready made quick reminders like a call payment email a template for grocery etc would add cheery to the cake
__label__3 fix the glitch where if you want to change the streak of a daily the keyboard pops up and gos down super annoying
__label__2 gtasks sync doens t work calendar sync is ok
__label__3 everything good simple and easy to use the best one but you dont get reminder as alarm so that you can actually know the schedule its just give a notification which can be easily ignored by mistake please fix this and link it up with alarm too just like you did with default calendar app
__label__2 this app doesn't seem to show multiple calenders for the same google account p s in my google calendar the desired calendar has got sync enabled still the issue exists p s 2 in the my calenders menu it is not even showing the second calender which i have made for the same google account
__label__4 could be better if it was completely free
__label__3 please provide undo and redo for all actions
__label__3 great way to start to get organized
__label__4 this is a simple app that gives me the capability of creating a to do list set event on my calendar and take notes
__label__3 it does not remind us so i deleted this app
__label__3 i like this better then the calendar that comes on my phone but it's too pricey i dont mind paying for an app i like or paying for the downloads i want in an app but you cant justify this price for what you get
__label__3 i am running this app on a droid turbo with stock lollipop installed the app has a very nice layout but unfortunately i find it to be very buggy it is impossible to create an event that includes monday and the app can't import recurring events from google calendar i have reported these to the developers and hope the app is cleaned up soon
__label__1 microsoft to do does almost all of this for free it is pointless to pay such a hefty sum of money for these so called premium features
__label__4 not as good as its old version wunderlist especially when you want to upload and download files through this app
__label__3 does not sync with google
__label__5 it is a great app and it helps me keep my schoolwork on time
__label__3 nice and simple task app however it is missing a couple of key features that are preventing me from switching over fun my current task app these are 1 no ability to set multiple reminders 2 cannot hide tasks until a later date for annual tasks i do not wish to see them constantly in my to do list i'd like them hidden until a certain date usually 1 month before due date furthermore due to the longevity of the task i like to be reminded early and then again closer to the time
__label__3 the app itself is very good nevertheless there's a problem i can't seem to make it work on my sony smartwatch 3 in fact as soon as i install the app on my phone the watch face appears on the watch but after a while about a minute it suddenly disappears
__label__2 fine for tracking but the reminders stop working after a couple of weeks this has happened with every new habit i've set up and i have a premium account and the developer doesn't respond to support requests
__label__2 not good
__label__1 sobad
__label__2 i find the concept of this app absolutely stupid i don't think people are gonna care about if a virtual plant dies if u use an app and the only thing it does is give u a notification as an incentive what the app should do is whenever someone opens an app forest should open and display over the app this will prevent others from casually using other apps while their work is in progress
__label__2 good concept but it does nor work i can still access youtube and go out of the app but the idea is very interesting has potential to be an amazing just the main point of downloading the app malfunctions
__label__5 intuitive flexible and free from nagging ads
__label__2 needs a dark mode
__label__5 best to do app i've come across
__label__5 best app for managing time
__label__3 too invasive and complicated
__label__3 it is a very good app for staying focused while studying but the problem i'm facing now is that the music keeps stopping at random intervals and i have to unlock the phone to keep the music playing please look into this otherwise it's a great app
__label__3 good app but in free version they should add more features just like reminder with time duration i like it's feature of description in which we can add sub task and tick then
__label__1 this app has some major problems it seemed to work fine for the first day of running after the first day no reminders were executed any game armor or weapons could never be equipped it appeared you could equip them but once you left the screen they become unequipped and they never showed up on the avatar i mainly got this app for productivity and since the reminders do not work i'm not certain i'm going to continue using it unless these problems are fixed
__label__1 this app launches itself with an invisible overlay over my home screen that is extremely suspect behavior and therefore uninstalling
__label__1 foolish app steals data doesn't have anything of itself takes everything from google calendar
__label__3 useless as you can not group habits but gamifying idea is good maybe they will fix it
__label__4 good app but it needs to have tasks accepted from google calender
__label__5 the best to do and calendar combined app i have come across and worth the fee have looked at many on android and ios and this is the only one that does what i want
__label__2 this app just disappeared two of the recent events i listed in both weddings luckily i thought of rechecking a day after inputting them this has happened a couple of times already too unreliable for work appointments i might get fired when i rely on this app's widget for work appointments close to uninstalling after i check out a good replacement
__label__2 very average app not intuitive will probably spend more time trying to plan than doing
__label__3 the important smart list is all mixed up and doesn't show which list each task is from
__label__5 i've tried different calendar apps for a few years now and this is the one that i have decided to keep for the longest time the monthly view is very neat event creation offers a lot of option and colors are easy om the eyes too
__label__4 i liked it but is there a widget for the app
__label__5 good app
__label__1 great concept but i can't even create an avatar this is a constant bug listed in reviews the company says that your selections should show up after you start actually using the app but how can they when we can't even actually choose anything i guess i'll try one of the competitors apps
__label__2 update 5 29 19 i decided to go ahead do the trial so i could see how the location reminder works so far i've tried about 3 different locations none of them have updated one of them was even my home this was about 30 mins ago i've been waiting for the app to work with google assistant it's been saying coming soon for quite some time when this happens i may consider doing the premium until then the 7 day trial is pointless to see how the service completely works maybe one day
__label__3 love the content but the price is way too high for premium
__label__3 i like this app and what it can do and am pleased with its functionality however having paid for the premium version i find it annoying beyond belief that i get pop ups every 2 weeks asking me to leave a review so developers i've left one but you've lost 1 5 stars for spamming me with these requests this shouldn't happen in a paid app without any opportunity to turn off these notifications
__label__5 great app for encouraging you to do things love that you can personalise your own tasks and play with friends would love to see the ability to repeat tasks on weekdays weekends instead of just daily weekly and an undo button would be awesome sometimes i'll mark something by accident and can't revert what hearts i lost coins i earned etc
__label__5 at first it appears cluttered but it won't take you very long to figure it out and by then you'll love it
__label__3 still has bugs that wunderlist did not for instance the widget that i usually keep on my launcher with lists of things to do oftentimes goes blank and stops working i'm totally fine with replacing a product with a more modern offering but it needs to work properly
__label__4 by far this is the best to do list app i have used but i have 2 issues with new widget first i can't press the icon and go to the app like i used to the icon is gone now and second the font is too small really hard to read my list
__label__2 i just noticed that notifications for yesterday's reminder disappear that is really bad wunderlist didn't have this bug
__label__2 pretty solid app does what it seems but one problem for me is that the alarms don't go off when they're supposed to instead of going off at the time i set they all go off next time i open the app they never go off until i open the app so they're useless
__label__5 i've found this app really useful for assisting my success in various areas sometimes stopping certain poor habits and sometimes starting positive new ones
__label__4 so useful
__label__3 nyc
__label__1 does not sync with google task list unless you pay 2 99 month or their annual rate quite disappointed since their beautiful platform does not meet minimum sync options of google task lists i only found out that u had to purchase a task sync option after i connected to my gmail account not cool at all b c it felt like a misleading bait and switch and now solicitor that i have to block because i synced my email to attempt what it said that it was able to do sorry tick tick but
__label__4 does what i need and makes remembering tasks very easy
__label__3 good
__label__3 nice app but why it doesnt sync with my google acount i mean when i add a new task it does not appear in my gmail task
__label__4 this app is great but maybe let us tick task we completed from widget as it's annoying the app will opened up when i pressed the box to tick what i've completed everytime
__label__3 please integrate kanban from web to the mobile app
__label__2 it is completely failing on reminders
__label__3 excellent app
__label__2 i tried to explore it a little after downloading i want something that will show me everything planned on the day i have notes on rather than me having to search if i do i tend to forget due to busy schedules i want automatic pop up i'll keep playing with it but so far dislike
__label__3 its a nice app but i always accidentally deleting a task when scrolling side to side please remove the delete feature when scrolling between tasks thanks
__label__3 need to improve it multiple tasks cannot be copied into a list user interface looks good
__label__2 notifications stopped working then it deleted all my tasks
__label__4 this is a great app the ability to track my habits and edit them as needed is really awesome there are just 2 things i'd really like to see that would make this a 5 star review for me 1 full editing options currently can't edit the frequency for my times per period items and 2 a help glossary feature i'm not sure exactly what the link icon means as it is 0 on items i've not done or done once but 1 on items that i've done twice or three times
__label__2 the android widget is pretty buggy desktop app is great android app not so much
__label__2 the changes made to how completed task are handled are not only bad ux but they introduced many quite critical bugs please fix
__label__1 i found it odd that the app didn't have preset hourly reminders most people have habits that require them to do them on specific hours for example gyming twice or thrice a day the app should have a feature on where you can input the exact times in the day when it should remind you another example of this would be reminder on every thursdays at 7am and 8pm i should be reminded of insert habit instead it's jungle of toggles that seem to not make sense
__label__5 this app is truly helping me be productive and the ui is very good reminders sent on whatsapp are a boon in short a great app
__label__4 i have only been using the app for a short period of time so far it has been a great tool the bility to addnsubtask to a task is very helpful great job
__label__2 super glitchy too frustrating to bother trying to use it
__label__3 it does not remind us so i deleted this app
__label__2 gtasks sync doens t work calendar sync is ok
__label__3 works well until you purchase pro after this all your calendar dates are displayed one day ahead your events on a monday in your calendar are displayed on sunday
"__label__2 i really liked the app helped me a lot with managing my time efficiently 
to get the most out of my day but since i updated it it started acting up 
it use to be so easy to simply move routine blocks around and now it's 
setting it's own times or plainly refusing to be moved to a later time 
block which is infuriating and the app also slowed down considerably 
after the update"
__label__1 do not download this app if you want to keep money in your account they took an unauthorized almost 40 out of my account their help page says they offer refunds within 48 hours however they offer no access to claim a refund
__label__5 one of the best app in play store
__label__1 the alarm doesn't work
__label__3 cloning is not working notification not accurate
__label__5 great app would love a desktop version that syncs
__label__1 i was excited to try this app but like many others have said the customization screen doesn't work let me know when it's fixed and i'll update and hopefully be able to start using it
__label__2 wonderful app with nice visual hierarchy but now ads take over the entire screen
__label__5 its a nice app for making routines
__label__5 only starting but it is a good little app so far easy to use and does what it needs to will see how it goes
__label__3 nice layout but it will not sync repaired events between my tablet and phone i contacted tech support but they were unresponsive and not helpful i do not recommend
__label__4 desktop version is better
__label__4 a today button would be helpful in the week view widget so that you don't have to scroll back and also the possibility to add more accounts are these features available in the pro version maybe the possibility to try it for a short period of time
__label__3 good app but too many bugs the app crashes when you want to buy a new type of trees recently i was unable to switch between tree types as well my android is updated i have pixel 2 that never had problem with other apps
__label__1 kept crashing rss feed if my calendar duplication of entries was huge and overall it just added to the noise rather than helping i'm out update no i can't send a feedback with log as i've already unsubscribed and uninstalled the app and that's surely something you can add into functionality if you're really interested in gathering the data
__label__1 please fix dark mode
__label__1 great app but only if it was an offline app i would've given it a five star please fix this
__label__3 great app better than google's free one but paying a subscription for such a simple app has rendered this useless im happy to oay a one off fee but im not willing to pay a subscription just access other features hence why its not 5 stars its just a to do list thats all
__label__3 before this l used wunderlist solely for my do listn i used workflowy for ongoing notes and events throughout the years i ike this app but if you don't get everything done yesterday's then my day iwhen you wake up the next day my day is blank imagine making to do list on a posted note and the next morning it was blank that's not saving me time don't know why they didn't put that in when developing the app
__label__1 the premium version of the app does not sync across multiple devices i use an android phone and a chromebook and it still does not work don't bother with premium
__label__4 muito bom só poderia liberar mais funcionalidades que só tem na versão premium
__label__1 use this app every day and used to totally love it but in the last month or so they have allowed full page video ads to take over the screen the only way to get rid of them is to force close the app which i now do repeatedly can't continue like this totally unacceptable what the heck could they possibly have been thinking downright stupid business decision looking hard for another app to replace this one as soon as i can it was nice while it lasted
__label__4 the first to do list app that makes me wanna do stuff instead of making longer and longer lists
__label__1 i used to love this calendar but now it has full screen ads videos that take over your phone can't do anything else while the pop up ad is running first one of these i saw uninstalled response the ads definitely come up more than twice per day and the calendar is definitely not functional while the ads are running you must wait for the commercial to end before you can open the calendar again i can understand bar ads at the top or bottom of a free app but full length commercials
__label__2 useful but constantly calls out to access crashlytics facebook etc too much spyware i'm searching to replace it app also locks you in so you cannot export to another app
__label__4 can construct reminders well with an in depth layout
__label__1 it's broken i try to create my account and i can't even use the name i want or customize my character it's just broken nothing displays
__label__4 i really loved this app it has everything i wanted but i feel like there is still room for improvement in this app it's my personal opinion though it will be better if you could add a screen for the heat map and that heat map would be colored on the days when user did at least one task another one could be letting user add notes for subtasks also
__label__1 the app looks nice but being forced to move over from wunderlist the import data functionality only working after the 5th try after two weeks and the web version literally becoming unresponsive when i load it tells me this app is not in any way finished or ready to be used i don't trust it to not lose my data so i can't use it thankfully other apps can import from wunderlist as well
__label__3 it actually is a good app but it wont do the one other thing i need it to do which is notify me of a task i set one day it does and the others it doesn't i have reset my phone settings several times because of this looked it up and still no results
__label__3 todo bien pero los anuncios nunca me deja verlos y cuando lo intento varias veces dice que he excedido el limite aun sin haber visto ninguno eso me molesta mucho y más aún habiendo pagado por la aplicación
__label__3 actually a great app i'm migrating from wunderlist and i love the option to add tasks from other lists to my day and focus on just those the 3 stars are from glitches that i'm experiencing that just make it troublesome for smooth working first is the from today tray that keeps coming up endlessly needing me to force quit the app only to have it happen repeatedly secondly the widget that doesn't update either tasks i've added or tasks i've marked as completed in the app
__label__5 thoroughly enjoy it and not too intrusive that it becomes a chore in itself
__label__1 terrible i am missing wunderlist after importing our tasks everything got mixed and doubled shared people and list owners mixed double blame on your engineering and programming i̇ will miss my lovely wunderlist
__label__3 edit uninstalled it takes too much interest honestly i find it not working offline a major issue i liked it but it is too slow and laggy not to mention the various bugs in game just today i was trying to add a new tag i entered it about 5 times before i gave up and them 15 minutes later i find the tag i entered repeated 3 times so i try to remove the other two also trying to organise the tasks' order the keep going back to their original order sometimes when i finish a task and check it it doesn't work and in the habits it stops working some times and other times it checks the habit twice positive or twice negative
__label__4 the app worked better when it was wunderlist it often has problems syncing which is inconvenient for shared lists overall the features are really nice though
__label__2 i try to set tasks for only specific days of the week but it does not work after i complete the task that's it it's done forever doesn't repeat since most of my tasks need this feature to work the app really isn't good for me
__label__3 would have give this app 5stars however everytime i restart my phone the app won't load i have to re install it everytime its annoying the widget
__label__5 excellent very versatile i like being able to set multiple reminders and the location
__label__2 acceptable
__label__5 its great
__label__5 great app using it all the time would be great to have a toggle for switching on and off the view of the completed tasks in today mode this motivates even more if you see how many things you accomplished today
__label__1 i wanted to like this app it's a very convenient way to see all the info i need right on the screen but when i click on the task button i get trapped on the task screen with no way back i have to kill the app to restart it in the clock visualization mode
__label__5 really easy to use you can go back to catch up on habits you left unfinished for previous days
__label__4 very helpful for me to list out my works
__label__2 there's no option to remove time rows in the widget only an option to remove the time bar which is kinda pointless was hoping for a simple layout for the widget to display only days 7 days without all those crowded rows of time displayed would otherwise give it a 5 star
__label__2 okay if you like planning with google it's exactly like that just prettier i don't see how this can replace a paper planner at all
__label__1 i have been using this for more than a year now it was great this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered pls fix this issue thanks
__label__1 todoist has lots of bugs after update most annoying 1 no longer able to select multiple tasks at a time 2 when writing a task keyboard blocks view of task box so you cant see what you're typing 3completeled subtasks used to remain but crosses out not it disappears forcing users to relearn how to use the app and 4 some tasks scheduled to appear under today does not makes you question the integrity of the app i see no benefits to recent changes only bugs
__label__1 oohh im very hardly managing it and its a disgusting app just a waste of time also it is not uninstalling
__label__4 i like it and i would definitely pay 20 for it but i cant justify paying a subscription if only i could pay once
__label__2 so cool but insanely expensive also wasn't clear how to get started even with the manual i have no reading comprehension issues there is just no getting started section or similar then i saw the fees 50 wow that is high i hate when people gripe that they're asked to pay for apps am a big fan of supporting developers but 50 is nuts this isn't a service one subscribes to ex spotify and 50 is nuts to purchase an app not trying to be mean am fine paying but 50 is way high
__label__1 my events show up at the wrong time in my calendar even when they've been manually entered what's the point of a planner that doest let you plan
__label__4 great app i am using it for a while functionality wise it the best in the market it can get updated in terms of visuals and performance
__label__3 missing obvious feature take a photo and set a reminder if it had that i wouldn't use google keep anymore even evernote can do that
__label__5 awesome
__label__3 this is a very cool app and thus have the ratings how ever it will be nice if you can add the functionality of sharing task or even with other users this will make it the all in one project task manager review update previously i was able to pick custom tags when setting a new event but now i can't and i have to pick a color and look for the same icon each time i want to create a new event this is counter productive as the main aim of the app is to help optimize time please fix this
__label__4 serves it's purpose
__label__3 if i leave the app nothing happened
__label__4 in general this app helps me keep track of my habits which is great however the app has quite a few bugs even after buying the premium version which is disappointing the sync function doesn't work at all and i don't see any effort to fix these issues this is one of the rare apps where i won't be giving a 5 star review
__label__1 thanks to the developer for your quick response however this calendar is useless for our group without those features we decided to go with business calendar pro previous comments wasn't able to see month or year view
__label__3 cool concept but i don't have the attention span for it
__label__1 initially i used to love this app bt lately when i press plant option the countdown never starts n even when sometimes the countdown starts m able to access other apps even after giving each n every access to the settings required for this app this ultimately makes me spend more time using cellphone pl check mobile micromax canvas infinity i updated app bt then still it's not working
__label__4 great app switch between the widget and calendar directly it can be improved but is great in its current form for some reason the widget disappears sometimes needing to be re added which is annoying
__label__5 really cool visual presentation lots of customization features great calendar keeper
__label__2 used to be good but recently it shows full screen ads which cannot be turned off
__label__5 this app really helps keeping yorself in tact
__label__3 cool layout very easy push notifications aren't working so it doesn't remind me at the time i tell it too but can't figure why i allowed notifications so probably a bug
__label__1 this sucks i thought u could plant trees by just playing it and spending you're time on it but nohh you need to pay for it i'm not saying for you to change it but it just sucks
__label__3 need a cleaner gui
__label__3 wish they add copy paste function remind specified time before due date options
__label__1 not good wasted time
__label__5 it was the best just one thing is not good that is not hard i need to reorder by finger rapid and soft like wunderlist and others i don't wanna to go in task and change priority it's so hard to imagine that work was what you are great thank you
__label__2 the free version is garbage compared to any do every other click pops up premium warning and it's annoying as hell
__label__5 highly appreciable app
__label__1 looks great alarms don't work the notifications just don't work on my motorola g7 plus running android 9
__label__2 i really like the application so far great interface and feature set i'd really like to see and would even do an inapp purchase for would be a much larger icon set i think being able to group characteristics and skills would be awesome too even better if the group can collapse it would also be cool to see a health bar that represents the amount of time you have in a day to be productive have it decrement as time passes and maybe make it adjustable for how much time you have in a day i think another tasklist app does that overall a great application i hope you continue working on this application edit the app is still decent but taking away the option to just remove ads for a one time price in favor of subscription only has made me decide to stop using this application and change my previous 5 star rating to a 2 star rating
__label__5 great help
__label__3 i really liked the reply from the app and i cleared the problem witj the persistent notification and thank you time tune plz if possible include a checklist option for routine which will be even more helpful thank you
__label__3 i want to be able to set so that the week starts from sunday highly inconvenient for i frequently set the reminder wrongly a day behind please upgrade so that the week start from sunday
__label__2 the app itself is really nice i like how the widget displays my schedule for the day it gives me a very nice grasp of my time the bad thing is that it slows down my smartphone i have a s9 and it drains a lot of battery it makes my phone lag and stutter when i try to open it i uninstalled ans reinstalled apps to check my theories so i uninstalled this one the phone was doing so much better and i even paid for the pro version
__label__5 nice application easy to track daily activities and also analysis all activities easily
__label__4 love the app but there is a bug in the current version of the app where next week actually schedules things for two weeks out actually scheduling in general in the app seems a little wonky these are new issues as of a few weeks ago otherwise it would be 5 stars
__label__5 amazing app i use it to track everything from art projects bills grocery lists even my food counter
__label__2 there's quite a lot of work to do with this app while it seems to functionally work well on a basic level a lot of core features from the wunderlist app have been removed or awkwardly placed restricted new features of the app are incredibly limited and feel poorly executed unfortunately there is nothing in this app that says i want this when migrating from wunderlist and makes other apps look more appealing i hope further updates from microsoft can deliver on user feedback
__label__1 lazy tech support just can't be bothered took down my initial adverse review to give tech support a chance to sort things out they just couldn't be bothered i'm using nine email and having a problem sharing with todoist when i want to create a task using an email sometimes it works more often it doesn't however sharing with wunderlist works every time todoist tech support answer sort it out yourself with nine update after numerous emails to tech support they still haven't bothered
__label__1 interface is not really satisfactory
__label__1 you can't choose week starts day calendar is a basis additional customization looks reasonable moreover ms support marked this request as in progress but 2 years ago is it a joke
__label__3 dear support it is a pity that microsoft is closing wunderlist because that app is very simple to use and very fast unfortunately your to do app is slower there is not done job with hashtags tasks need to be selected before moving in wunderlist everything is much simpler and faster guys please take good features from there it is big pain to lose wunderlist at least upgrade your app normally thank you
__label__5 great calendar
__label__5 since i linked it with a smart watch i've been able to make the most out of everyday which is huge since i used to do nothing due to indecision i've scheduled time for both professional stuff self improvement and working through my backlog of movies and games super easy to use too and good backup support i switched phones and all my routines were imported solid app
__label__3 how do you email your tasks on it how do you sync it with the google calendar
__label__5 it really works i tried other apps like those that keep the phone locked but ended up unlocking it more often as a challenge this one instead had my phone unlocked but it was nice to see the saplings bloom and whenever i peeked a look there was message like don't look here or focus as if i was being watched so it kept me from using the phone and i was able to concentrate really liked the app highly recommended would recommend to all
__label__4 we use it for running our home project improvements it is easy to use not as user attractive as some but ok
__label__3 i kinda miss the old system where time specific trees styles were the thing now you can pick anything after focusing for 10 minutes it actually takes away incentive to study focus longer nitpick 1 the bracketed week has no space after the day example monday week instead of monday week nitpick 2 sharing it would be nice to share more than just an image of the forest perhaps some tree stats much like there is underneath the forest itself
__label__1 buggy as all hell the advertisement is right it gamifies tasks but that's it no tracking history of your habits inaccurate as all hell worst of all is you can't delete your account they'll forever keep your data i'm sure that's illegal in parts of this country and around the world definitely don't use your real email to sign up to test it out
__label__3 good
__label__5 good
__label__3 i really like the idea but needs more updating i move around a lot so i'd need it to update the routines and timelines with my current time zone or at least make it an option ill check back in few and see how it's progressing
__label__5 this app is really great the best part about it that it's connected to google calendar
__label__1 i used to love this app and have used it for a while but now nothing is synving between my devices samsung galaxy s8 and mac nothing at all no matter how many times i reset and reinstall i've tried for an hour
__label__5 friendly app that help you to optimize your time
__label__5 simple and works well best free one i've found
__label__4 nice
__label__1 please tell me how to use the app
__label__5 it's great
__label__1 i love this app but why does the timer not seem to support landscape mode give stars otherwise
__label__4 excellent app i use it every day i've got a few small requests though if possible another app i tried had the option to drag drop timelines to reschedule times e g make things a little shorter or longer it's not an absolute necessity but i find it a little clunky having to edit each event in turn although i do love the add this gap to previous next activity option also not a necessity but would be a nice touch i'd love to be able to reorder my routines couldn't figure out why they were all in a funny order but it arranges them alphabetically and since i make a routine for each day of the week they were all very jumbled up i've solved it for now by adding numbers to the start of each name but again just slightly clunky as for the rest i absolutely adore it love the persistent notification each time i pick my phone up absentmindedly to check my notifications i see what i'm meant to be doing and it gets me back on track thank you
__label__3 fine
__label__5 excellent app for time management
__label__4 very good app helps me stay organized
__label__3 it would be much better with an ability to have a report at the end of the month as to what was worked on and when ie statistics
__label__4 ok
__label__4 great app would be nice to be able to check the checklist items in todos
__label__4 not very expressive frame for activity descriptions must be in the first stages of development guilds look incredible diverse very surprising it is a social app seems the leveling function is standard gaming and well embedded hope open sourcing it make it better fit passing habits to to do would be desirable
__label__1 unable to import wunderlist data says nothing to import
__label__1 doesn't work nothing happens when signing in with google and when creating a new account it just shows server timeout
__label__2 not so great the user interface is not friendly making the to do list takes far too long and theres no way that i found to make a list that repeats daily i'll just stick to google keep
__label__5 helps me to organize my day when i don't have my physical planner at hand held me to remember important and vidal tasks that help sort out my family and daily routines while allowing to add onto my busy schedules throughout the week also able to sort out the important tasks by colour coordination thank you for the opportunity to have a great planner at my fingertips
__label__4 i wish there was an option to create a to do list for tomorrow like i wish there was a my tomorrow that would turn into my day instead of me having to manually add all the things i wrote the day before if that makes sense
__label__1 looks good but it doesn't sync with events from existing calendars it only syncs the holiday calendar but not my personal calendar
__label__1 app not work after purchase plz dont buy user interface not good beacuase eralier version is good
__label__3 good app
__label__3 list to do
__label__5 allow notes and tasks sync to google drive with date time stamps
__label__3 i liked the app well enough to pay for it so i could get my recurring items in order with it but when i set a task as recurring it only shows up on the day that i started with
__label__3 good app minus one star because of the constant nagging and that's in the paid version
__label__1 all right so to be clear this app is amazing and i'm really happy to see that someone has made their own version of it even though it's such a great program it became unusable at day one it had bugs and limitations that hindered what i was attempting to accomplish problems such as inaccurate characteristics no quick access from rewards to inventory non removable default achievements inaccurate values on skills after undoing a task and hidden xp multiplier from skills to characteristics
__label__3 please add pause provision in the app for long time study so thay actual focus can be counted
__label__3 nice app
__label__3 app was great but now i cant set my work end times only starting due to it being restricted for premium only now after the new update bad timing guys uninstalling app
__label__2 missing grocery list widget and quantity for grocery list items
__label__4 it's sadly evident that most to do list apps are created by people with remarkably little to do this is a delightful rare exception logical simple but powerful with all the basic necessities covered and good customization options this is the closest mobile equivalent to abstractspoon's todolist available edit removing one star for the total removal of local backup monetization is understandable and deserved but removal of a simple local failsafe to push premium cloud backup reeks
__label__1 i kept getting empty screens when opening the app so i pressed skip filled out the registry info and was taken to character creation where i couldn't see my character or the build options i could select things like body or hair but nothing appeared relating to that
__label__4 working great for me simple to use relatively detailled free
__label__2 i'm a pro user worked great initially but it is not opening and continuously stopping please fix this asap
__label__4 its a very good app however i guess its desktop version is not available if they have it will be a great organizing app great app
__label__1 not getting notifications
__label__1 app crashed after creating a daily task with 2 day habit would fail and bring up a warning that the task failed and to press ok however you couldnt tap ok it just did nothing this happened every time gave up and uninstalled the app on a pixel 2 xl
__label__5 it's a wonderful app to help you focus more on your work or studies you can select a time of how long you want to focus you can choose from 10m to 2h while doing that you also have a wide range of options available of all kinds of trees and bushes the more time you select the more coins you get rewarded and with those coins you can buy new trees or bushes i have bought the premium version for 1 99 which isn't much at all and because i have it i can personalise the app blacklist
__label__2 бесплатная версия не очень лучше уже использовать microsoft to do
__label__3 ok works like wunderlist which was wonder ful except it doesn't integrate with google calendar wth
__label__1 the tutorial doesn't help and shows you nothing the app is very bad and isn't easy to understand i have given up after wasting time trying to figure this trash out i wouldn't recommend this to anyone
__label__1 loved it until they added cartoon ads you'll be with a client and a video game comes up as you're scheduling their appointment makes us look very unprofessional
__label__4 great app good at keeping you accountable and productive would be nice to be able to re order your to dos though and set deadlines for when they have to be done
__label__2 generalle good and easy to use unfortunately the sync backup feature seems to be broken so i can't transfer habits to a different device the csv export is also useless as theres bo way to open it in a different device
__label__4 the perfect planner only thing missing is that remimder is not working
__label__4 add negative habits which when done decrease coin xp etc
__label__5 great for stalking
__label__3 dear developer i'm unable to view my calendar events in this why it happens how and why its happened what is the alternative otherwise i would give 5 stars
__label__3 very nice app but there are a few bugs with the widget not really updating to the correct data e g if you put the widget on home screen change the name of the tasks list it doesn't update
__label__1 another app that fails to draw events correctly on day view if i have an event from 3 00 to 3 15 and another from 3 15 to 3 30 there should be drawn with a space between them no matter how much i am zoomed in they are not overlapping events so don't treat them like they are
__label__5 this is a great app for my needs i've got one issue but not sure how to explain it's when i look at my daily events and click on the day i can't get it to disappear so i close the app
__label__2 good bt nt what i was looking for
__label__2 i loved this until recently many entries disappear panic attack i can't count on it anymore what gives
__label__3 seems pretty neat but i miss one feature thst is very important for me be able to just hit start stop for tasks thst needs to be done for at least x minutes per day i dont check or remember time when i start doing something
__label__5 seems perfect will let you know of that changes lol i wish it didnt need google calendar i do not want to synch to google
__label__3 the app is pretty good but i wish there was a way to put weekly tasks in i tried setting up a task that would go off weekly but i still lost health for not completing it daily it would be nice to be able to put repeating tasks on the app that you don't do every day but repeat on a schedule like laundry every sunday or something
__label__1 same issue as don smith who wrote a review on 10 10 19 will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in op current phone is the google pixel 4xl perhaps i misspoke in regards to the reply my issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content
__label__3 functional not beautiful nothing particularly advantageous compared to other calendar apps
__label__2 it would be a very helpful app if it actually worked the way you'd expect if i say i want a task to be weekly but make it so i can complete that task any day what i'm trying to do is make the task flexible so i can do the weekly task whatever day of the week i feel like instead however making it available everyday turns it into a daily task which i will be punished for by not completing daily my only real solution at the moment is filling up my to do list which is really frustrating
__label__2 stuck on setting up your account
__label__3 informative but extremely slow
__label__1 way to confusing to use the tutorial didnt help at all
__label__3 can only track 5 habits but there are discussion forums most of the forums have no activity going on but there are still a few users to talk to often times the app no longer syncs me to them just like right now the quotes have been stuck too developers no longer support this app do not buy the premium version as you will not be able to sync across devices there are no more updates or customer support this could have been the absolute best habit tracking app so much wasted potential
__label__3 good app and nice after the latest update
__label__5 great habit tracking app very clean and simple interface fantastically elegant design other habit tracking apps are not as user friendly i contacted the developers on a couple of concerns i had and they were already working on these features to be added in future updates
__label__3 guys please assist me on notification no notification on my one plus 6 ive paid premium problem still persist even there's no battery saver nor notification blocker turned on please advise thanks
__label__3 i dislike the update but mostly i dislike that it was changed and i had to look here to find out why if you are going to change the core functionality of the app at least say so when i open it i am greatly fighting my response to just uninstall out of frustration
__label__2 trying to set a reoccurring daily task is so convoluted that it requires reading a lengthy help article i've switched to google tasks which is way more intuitive
__label__4 another important feature missing is the ability to tell if i have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar currently the calander view shows days in a circle please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day this is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on on top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task that is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one
__label__3 i like using this app i would love to see a sync between devices in future
__label__5 i got this app to track my medication and it's perfect i can set up how i want to take each medicine yes no or quantity see the start date and adherence in the summary view and even track side effects and effectiveness each day then see them in a chronological list in the sunmary and the best part is that it's not tied to some medical database added bonus i can track real to dos as well overall love this app
"__label__2 beutiful and easy to use once you get used to it however i wished creating 
an event was a bit more simple and quick update no longer syncs to my 
calender and the dates are all messed up too bad i loved it"
__label__5 literally the only app i found where the today widget shows only what is happening today every other one will show the next couple of tasks even if they're weeks out didn't know that was a ludicrously ridiculous request but apparently it is so thank you
__label__3 used to love this app but the new widget is ugly unreadable and too easy to accidentally check something i'll be looking for a replacement if this hasn't been fixed by the time my subscription runs out
__label__1 you need to pay it's uselles without paying seriously just 9 list for free if you need more list just add them in wunderlist and then import them to this app or better stick with todo from microsoft it's free
__label__2 i love that you can chose x amount of days a week to complete a habit other apps force you to commit to specific days the flexibility in this app helps me succeed what i hate about this app is it fails to get my habit completion for example i did my workout for the day but still receive repeated notices to do said workout for that day way to drain any joy out of an accomplishment habitbull
__label__4 best pomodoro app there's only two things that i'd wish they included 1 i wish they allowed portrait mode so i can have my phone propped up sideways 2 could you guys please allow this app to take up the whole screen so i don't get distracted by notification icons or the time
__label__5 good
__label__2 coming from wunderlist todo it's annoying to use adding items to a list used to be quick and simple ms over complicated it
__label__1 it's says error when copying data when i tried to export data can you please mail me the solution again please
__label__3 i would gladly pay 5 for the premium features of this up but they want a monthly subscription i don't think that's a fair price at all but it's a good app with the free features so 3 stars
__label__4 thank you for responding and i'm looking forward to that update customized categories another improvement i'd love to see are more options for a goal besides a daily one such as save 100 per week etc i got the premium and love the dark theme this app is the best i've found for my needs thank you
__label__5 simple and efficient
__label__1 i've bought the pro version and after a week it disappeared disappointing
__label__4 really helped me up my discipline
__label__1 i was enjoying this app and decided to buy the premium features but they took the money and provided nothing at all i tries contacting the developer via email and no answer at all stay away
__label__2 the tracker itself is not bad but i set up a notification to remind me to do something and am not getting them i already checked my settings all is good it's nice if you remember to go in and mark done but notifications are not working
__label__5 awesome app used it before but downloaded again to help me focus while studying at home during social distancing
__label__5 pretty nice helpful and useful app like it
__label__2 gawd what's up with the ugly orange and why can't i change it to something more palatable
__label__4 notifications fixed app keeps getting better i'd like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements edit nice d another thing i would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked example unlocked 01 04 2019 so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab thanks for this app
__label__3 impressive could be better if it had its inbuilt calendar which is linked with events of google calendar it should also have to do list with with alerts a weekly planner thia will make it perfect
__label__1 microsoft bought an already mature application spent 4 years working on it and this is all they have to show for it perhaps they could add more technical resources to support the 2 high school students that currently support this product poorly integrated with outlook simple too simple has very few features or functionality
__label__2 good
__label__5 i'm pretty picky with task apps ticktick is one of the best i've used good functionality with flexible usage models
__label__1 poor settings options i tried to set a schedule for an entire day to be more productive kept getting emails for each task at the time i scheduled it i also got notification pop ups on my macbook calendar app which seemed to sync itself with my google calendar i went to google calendar to turn it off but it wouldn't let me i had to delete all 10 emails hide the notifications and now i will be uninstall this app it should have an option to disable syncing nice idea lazy developers
__label__3 random ad pop ups that distracts while pulling up a meeting in a hurry doesn't parse contacts from email meeting invites into names you can easily add and remove is pro worth 6 a little too high imo but developer is entitled to sell at whatever price i find google calendar works fine for my needs
__label__5 works great user friendly and comes with a variety of colors to choose from the colors are nice and they are adjustable to your liking easy to organize and to navigate it's simple and functional i like how you can set the notification to make it stay on there forever until you swipe it to the side that way i am still informed about something important while it's still visible on my screen in case i miss the reminder
__label__3 i think you need to improve the ui and the ui names its really confusing
__label__3 it's got a steep learning curve and i don't think it's got good documentation help faqs
__label__4 wonderful app i am really able to concentrate more now a must try app for someone who loses focus easily
__label__3 good premise just doesn't sync with any calendars unhelpful guide
__label__3 loved it initially but after a while the notifications would stop showing up and i was constantly having to refresh background tasks too much for me to use often
__label__5 amazing app i love that you can slide from one day to several days as you please very user friendly pretty colors and no bugs also adding an event is simple and fast kudos to the developers
__label__1 upgraded and lost all my tasks from previous version very disappointed
__label__5 if i wish to make an app this would be the best idea i can came with
__label__2 when editing or deleting a recurring task it should ask if you're doing it just for this task or all recurring tasks instead of deleting and editing all tasks without asking 2 when creating a recurring task i should be able to time it on different times for each reccuring day instead of having to create the same reccuring task for each seperate day
__label__5 this app has helped me organize my life and start habits that i've always been wanting to also it has a pomo timer that helped me get many projects done great app
__label__2 i couldn't understand it probably my fault but i find it complicate and i like to organize my day like without go and add on my calender just on this app but like i said it's probably my fault gonna try this app again later maybe like after couple of different updates
__label__5 i've been looking for an app that can do what habitbull does and i'm so glad i finally found it it's a great easy to use app and the messages you get are so cute
__label__1 want to customize colors buy the pro version not a chance thanks for nothing b
"__label__2 repeat function doesnt work so you can't set up tasks to be repeated 
daily you can basically create a list and then delete items as they are 
completed that is all this does basically useless for anything other than 
a shopping list"
__label__2 no background sync i love the ui and widget but it won't update notes i create change from the pc unless i physically open the app which renders it useless for my needs
__label__3 i have tried various time organizing apps and this one is best till now
__label__5 非常棒 整体也很简洁明了 非常喜欢
__label__3 this app keeps getting closed in the background on a clean android i'm using it on oneplus 7 with android 9 reminder notification doesn't show up at the time i set also adding task is pretty absurd please make it look like wunderlist with a simple button and lot of features at hand in a big space
__label__4 very good app helps me stay organized
__label__1 looking at the features and lots of accolades i tried uninstalled after just a trial reason in the free version notification feature is missing if the task misses the set time there is no notification we will come to know only if we open the app insanely ridiculous not sure what have the product team thought while excluding such a basic feature
__label__3 i love this app i bought the premium version last year and i still can't synchronize my data i have to change my phone and i will lose all the data could you fix that
__label__3 sub tasks should be possible to leave unticked for instance i might have put the bins out but not replaced bin bags on your apo if i tick the main task it assumes i have done the sub task
__label__3 i cant set widget on homescreen can you help me plz
__label__3 i liked but in my cellphone had some bugs galaxy a8 i think if this app had a function to sync with the phone calendar google calendar or samsung calendar it would be much better
__label__1 tells me it can't import all my data and to retry but when i retry it tells me everything is up to date and there's nothing to import of course the one list that's missing is the only one that's important i'll be trying another app thanks but no thanks
__label__2 it's a mess i add new tasks and tag them but they will randomly disappear reappear and the tags will disappear editing and adding them back in doesn't help because once a tag disappears you can't add it back in again disappearing tasks is the worst because there's no warning they're just gone they're not listed as complete they just disappear sometimes they'll come back but sometimes i have to re enter them assuming i remember i pay for this app so the fact that the basic functionality of keeping my list intact is random and spotty is unacceptable it may have something to do with syncing no idea but either way i'm going to use another app because i just don't trust it anymore these errors seem to be recent like in the last 3 months
__label__5 this is such a fun way for chores to be rewarded my household is full of gamers and this is a great way to create and maintain habits as well as track chores on a daily weekly or monthly basis they are great about getting back to users they have real conversations and listen to user feedback
__label__1 below expectation i purchased this app based on glowing user reviews created an account in order to sync across my devices however i find that if i create a habit on one device it doesn't show up on my other device this needs to be addressed immediately
__label__5 not gonna lie i found this app from a tik tok video i downloaded it to laugh at it but it turned out to be an amazing app
__label__3 app crashing a lot do look into it and solve the problem asap
__label__4 i like this app i wish the 24 hour mode wasn't a part of the pro version i would like to try it before i purchased but i like the visual of my day on the graph and the sync with my calendar or is now my main screen in my phones screen
__label__4 everything is good only one feature shall be add we should be able to customise reminder notification tone
__label__2 the new widget redesign omits one important feature before the widget has todoist icon and i could use it to launch the app from the widget right away it is no more there so i have to go to the app drawer to lunch the app every time i need it makes widget less useful not happy
__label__4 a good app in general i would love to be able to have loose tasks for example practice spanish twice a week which should be completed at least twice every week also why not allow icons to be any emoji
__label__4 i am a wunderlist native i do like this move except for one simple thing as if now i wish items were added at the top instead of the bottom i realize i can sort but i put some lists in a specific order for a reason
__label__3 i love the app but recently the widgets have been glitching they go blank or sometimes do respond when i click a checkbox
__label__5 solid to do list app with very nice features such as karma points and 7 days ahead the best app in my opinion
__label__5 it's great
__label__3 i love the design and the app in general i would give it 5 stars if it would allow to size the image and the information displayed
__label__3 hate the ads
__label__4 i love this
__label__1 i give it one star because the main feature is broken for me i set pill reminders on daily cycle but it misses the notification sometimes i tried adding the app to not optimized battery but it still misses reminders
__label__3 thanks for your comments why does google calendar sync perfectly and bc not when all on the same account i think some while ago possibly due to an update this stopped syncing reliably either regularly or even when sync button pressed in business calendar menu deleting an event on this samsung galaxy phone sometimes forces a sync sync is important as i use this with google calendar on desktop previously wrote easy to use and great that i can copy appointments
__label__1 no longer work in android 9 it can t load meetings from outlook or even from google accounts interface is badly designed too
__label__3 doesn't work with wear os
__label__4 very good it is a bit complicated to use it should probably have a tutorial or an expailnation about the different functions as some of them just seem to be the same thing with just a differeent look i could just be stupid which is a possibility
__label__2 it's very confusing i got the calendar app that was suggested to me when i wanted to use the widget but once i started using the calendar along with any do the tasks notifications got duplicated i don't see the point of having any do when the calendar app does the same thing
__label__1 the app used to perfectly work before the new update now it needs internet connection to work and even if it's working i can still use the applications please remove the bugs i procrastinated too much today
__label__2 i actually really like this app but one of the biggest features that needs to work properly for my routines is repeating reminders i set reminds for monthly bills such as rent and set it to repeat monthly but when i complete the task it uncompletes itself the very next day without setting the reminder to the next month basically if i set it to november 1st it tries to remind me again daily on november 1st it doesn't work i love the app but the most important feature is broken sadly
__label__1 this app started out great everything was so organized and i was happy i had a digital schedule with reminders to carry with me but it stopped giving me notifications it also stopped showing my reminders all together i wanted to uninstall the app for a while because it's never working but today was the last straw i had a reminder put for my midterm but of course since it's such an awful app it didn't notify me i missed my midterm screw this app don't download it
__label__1 why does this basic app need access to my contacts and refuse to work without give me a break you filthy parasites
__label__1 wff
__label__1 only certain google calendar entries show in the sectograph making this absolutely pointless a great idea that is flawed in execution
__label__5 very useful app for many thing to avoid bad habits
__label__3 i started playing with it and it freezes often and i don't like how my notes have to be on that day and not just by themselves
__label__5 still learning looking good so far nothing to complain about
__label__5 love it i wish there was a reminder option for when things ended as well i think there used to be or maybe that was another app
__label__3 seems good so far i might rate it higher after using it for longer but the annoying pop up messages forced me to either say i didn't like it or rate it now edit to reply to the response there was only the option to review now or say i didn't like it i would have picked review later if that was there edit 2 thanks for taking my suggestion on board i will update this review and rating once i have used the app more
__label__3 this was a great app a year or more ago the simplicity of adding and checking off tasks without clutter of a bunch of fancy features was it's strength basically it was as simple as making a list on a piece of paper with the added bonus of having reminders now however it requires more steps to add to dos and is becoming more of a complicated app loosing the original appeal as of some time ago notifications also stopped working which mean i will leave after some 5 years of use
__label__3 simple and easy to use
__label__1 online really register really there's two other apps in the suggested similar apps banner that are better than this they're free to use with out registration why for this type of app full offline again
__label__1 worst app i qm trying to create acount with gmail but it say no internet connection even my internet work fine every thing working nicely even you tube without lagging
__label__3 it's fun a great concept but the app itself needs work it locks up constantly and has to be manually shut down and then re started and the reminders basically don't work at all honestly i think it would be best to remove the reminder feature for now until it can be fixed because not having a way to set one at all is better than using the feature and thinking you'll get a needed reminder when you won't because it doesn't actually work
__label__4 one of the best to do list planners in play store
__label__4 set a color which depends on percentage for goals
__label__3 the big cons to this app dailies tab always shows all of my weekly duties instead of the daily ones i change this in the filter but once i reopen the app it switches back to showing everything what's the point of a filter when the app doesn't save it galaxy note 8 also why is there no dark mode my eyes are screaming at night
__label__1 cant even get past the first screen i get a notice that my phone is blocking the app but there are no instructions in the troubleshooting for my pixel i've looked all over my settings there's nothing i can find to change to allow this app to do something frankly i'm dubious that this app somehow needs some extreme level of permissions that no other ever has especially as it hasnt told me why
__label__3 it doesn't ring or do any sign to remind me about my work
__label__3 i wanted an app that would allow me to create grocery lists from web desktop but access them from mobile at the time of writing this functionality still isn't fully working grocery lists are categorized on mobile but the web version just shows a single list with all items mixed together auto categorization has been working on mobile since 2018 but the developers still have not bothered to port this important feature to desktop also i feel that far too many of the options are locked down for premium users even trivial options like background colors
__label__3 app still needs a lot of work it's not at the point of being worth a paid subscription it needs more organizational tools an easier way to repeat tasks daily weekly monthly as well as a timeframe for each task not for notifications but for organization also when getting events from the calendar it should only grab current or future events to reduce the clutter
__label__4 great
__label__5 this app is actually good for daily routine things which i like 1 ui 2 optimization 3 functionality 4 dark ui 5 no ads 6 no charges
__label__3 love the tracking love the accountability i use the widget but i dont like that you can't split habits into profile type structures for example an am routine list of check offs and a pm routine maybe those and a list of habits you just want to complete daily at any time that would be a game changer for me i've considered other apps because of that one missing feature i dont like how the widget groups every single habit into one list i want to split habits up between multiple
__label__4 good one
__label__3 the app was working great up until recently now i cant click on the date and update it directly through the widget i have to open the app and make changes through there what happened
__label__5 amazing
__label__2 aneh masa pas masuk ke apk nya malah keluar_
__label__3 best habit tracker edit can you guys fix the overall habitbull score graph it's not accurate always trending down no matter what
__label__3 hi how do i add back my premium account i deleted account by mistake
__label__4 i hate change to begin with but everything has been good so far my only gripe right now is with the themes i wish we could custom pick a color or choose a photo from our phone gallery
__label__1 very bad experience
__label__3 i like this app and i bought premium even it was a little expensive 5 49 euro what i don't like is habits with a numeric value don't allow at least 0 times a day if you want to do something 6 times a week with the possibility to do it twice on one day it will stay undone the other days 1 tasks habits which are marked as undone may be send to the bottom too 1 whitout premium you only can scedule up to 7 habits after a removal of any named defect i will change my rating
__label__1 do not download this app there are ads everything you use i as of feb 26 2020 despite what the developer says about the 18 hour just read other reviews and you'll see that the intrusive ads have killed this free app look for another similar app
__label__1 it tells you your own account has a problem and doesn't let you sign in it doesn't even accept your phone number which is just plain stupid
__label__3 not free
__label__2 i like the concept because i've been trying to gamify my free time for a while assigning a predifined score to each habit practiced the most during every hour and all i wanted was the positive and the negative habits to affect the same progress bar with the possibility to keep track of a daily score with a possibly negative value it's a damn shame but this aint for me i wish it was more customisable
__label__3 there wasn't a synchronization between the app and outlook mail calendar
__label__2 i have used this app for my business for a looong time and love it however can someone explain to me why i'm getting spam notifications from bc2 announcing my winning stuff like shoes and iphones at least once a week this happens and as i said i use it for my business and don't really have time to forward these things to 10 of my friends via whatsap which i do not use if it's you guys stop it if it's some other hijinks then let me know how to fix it please
__label__3 bad calendar sync
__label__4 for some reason i can't edit my other review on the phone or if i can it's not clear how lists are not in an intuitive place imo so i missed them entirely resulting in that erroneous post if this supported arbitrarily nested task levels i'd give it five stars but i'm definitely going to use this r i p wunderlist
__label__3 não consigo mudar a linguagem já fui nas opções e tudo mas sempre atualiza e fica no inglês
__label__5 i use it everyday and completely love it it is very simplistic to use and understand even for older folks like me if i'm putting together a list of projects i want to get done it's allows me to take a picture or a screenshot then title and save it by category extremely helpful for users of all age groups and with the backup sync features you just can't go wrong with this app
__label__3 amazing and helpful
__label__2 would like to change my my class and chat is impossible to navigate a simple notification system would make it easy
__label__3 great app gives me the motivation to do the work and have a little garden of my own but lately it doesnt want to start crashes as soon as i click on it please do something
__label__5 love it
__label__5 wow i just love the app it's so helpful
__label__3 its seem complex in the first time anyway can see all activity in the big picture
__label__1 free version is very limited and there are thousands of similar free apps that do what the paid one does dev likes to argue this but the app is really not very useful unless you buy a monthly subscription changed from 2 to 1 star for developer being actively misleading about this
__label__5 absolutely awesome i've only had it for a few days but it's behaved like a dream much more detailed customizable than any other 'gamify' app i have used
"__label__5 i like using this app helps me write when i most need it and has helped me 
use it whenever i can't explain or express myself so thank you"
__label__5 was literally just about to upgrade to pro and install on my new fossil gen 5 unfortunately the watch face does not work it worked before when i had a ticwatch last year so is there a reason it's not showing up on the wear os app edit got a response immediately over email and was able to troubleshoot my issue y'all also earned a pro member
__label__1 recent major update has strongly impeded on usability of app i understand and appreciate the focus on subtasks and some other features however i think the developers have severely misjudged the actual most common user stories was always a big fan paid subscriber for many years but this update was a major letdown unnecessary changes for something that was working almost perfectly
__label__2 it would be a 5 review if it weren't yearly payment put it a one time payment and i'll be the first one to buy it this really ruined it for me
__label__4 i love the to do lists with simple and useful style and features but the calendar is lacking a bit you should be able to change events color would be nice to have independent notes instead of notes in each task if it had that the app would be the best organizer
__label__2 no search option mixing up of completed and incolplete tasks in list mismanaged
__label__1 too much setup i just want to write my notes not title subtitle everything on the plus side no permissions
__label__5 cant add the widget to my screen id prefer having a widget instead of opening the app
__label__4 clear concisive calendar like the sharing capabilities haven't had any issues
__label__3 why would i pay money to have recurring events in a planner i think i'll stick with my default calander app
__label__2 can't check of checklist items
__label__1 it doesn't alarm
__label__3 synching between my chromebook and phone is a necessity for me and does not work on this app the color coding for completed tasks is not intuitive
__label__3 i like this app but it would be better if the duplicate list feature is included in the mobile version
__label__5 best productivity app till now
__label__3 hmmm working good
__label__5 love great date keeper
__label__2 hi i can add just 1 event why i try to add more in google calendar it shown but in this app it's not show up
__label__5 tried a few different apps over 2 years but always came back to ticktick works well for me aligns to me needs and i find it intuitive i'd recommend especially since it offers a lot of features which are premium in others apps unsolicited advice to anyone looking for a to do app there is no app that works best no one size fits all unfortunately you need to test a bunch and decide which works best for you
__label__2 too much spam stuff that i don't care for pops up on my screen all the time and blocking those also blocked the reminders i wanted the app for also too many emails i don't want more clutter to organize my life
__label__1 purchased the plus version and now with the update to pro i no longer have my premium features
__label__4 may i know what's the difference between this app and the any do calendar app
__label__4 beautifully done love the features
__label__4 it is a cool app but the calendar feature required to be bought that should be informed to the users before installation in addition it would be a good idea if skills can increase over time and skills can decrease characteristics
__label__3 i am in love with this app so far i wish there was an ios version available to connect with my friends though i would recommend this to everyone otherwise 3 stars for now due to limited availability
__label__2 unable to log in unable to create a new account or link to facebook
__label__5 excellent interface with a variety of easy to use options i like the clear colourful month view with enough written information on screen to see what each day has recorded without having to tap on each individual day to view information much better than other calendars i've tried
__label__1 update 2020 sadly they didn't reach out to me despite me paying for premium version lost my account and no means of logging back in otherwise the app is good especially the ui like this app but until recently i had to change phones and the database could not locate my email and the app changed names and logo so it's all confusing if you could help me locate my account as i bought the premium version but couldnt log in to my account please help because i want to use this great app
__label__3 it makes you rate the app and its extremely annoying
__label__5 i like it
__label__3 tnx
__label__1 used this app for months with no issues but after most recent update it plays an ad every time i add a new event to my calender awful
__label__3 kinda complicated still not used to it i love the widgets though
__label__3 wile installing on my note 9 it imported shows promptly each allready existing entry from each of my calendars but it does not import synchronize any new entry via any calendar within android i already removed the app from being affected by the battery saving option 'close the demo' pop up is not present thank you very much for helping out because this way of visualization by merging agenda and clock face is how my mind needs it used it many years ago and never found it back again as a contemporary app if only i get it to work
__label__1 good
__label__4 everything i wanted and more finally has updated almost to perfection integration with google fit or samsung health and or any gear would be amazing
__label__3 hi long time ticktick user unfortunately the app still has big issues with subscribed local calendars recurring events from the local calendar are doubled in the list view and have been for a long time now the last time it worked properly was in 5 2 1 i notified you guys a long time ago but it hasn't been fixed i finally tried any do and it works properly with my local calendar so it seems that i will be giving them my subscription money this year
__label__3 this is a good app however it has a few bugs that need attention that could easily make the app 5 stars
__label__1 it's very easy to accidentally complete tasks and the only way to undo an accidental completion is behind a pay wall instant one star
__label__1 ruined a perfectly good app add task above below features have been removed when i create a new task it goes all the way to the bottom of the list i have to then drag it all the way back up to the top of the list of 100 tasks app is now useless
__label__4 this app is good to schedule your daily routine on a weekly basis i liked it but i could be better if we could log our actual activities time also and if this app could show a comparison between what was scheduled and what is actual
__label__3 nice but without calendar integration it is still incomplete
__label__3 not bad
__label__1 doesn't import anything from my calendar despite my calendar being ticked as a source so pretty much pointless i'm not double entering everything
__label__5 it really helped dude i have online school and since there is no teacher to scream at me i delay my work but never seem to do it but thanks to this app i'm planning everything and i'm slowly getting back in track recommend to all students out there
__label__5 xxx
__label__3 amazing app i love the concept of combining productivity and rewards together the feeling of satisfaction and joy is just thrilling after your time is up and you successfully planted a cute tree only thing that isn't working for me is that the page for buying trees isn't loading i can't see the trees i want to buy and there's an error whenever i want to buy a sound to sum it up i can't buy trees or sounds please fix this bug as i want to unlock more trees
__label__4 good app tracks nicely good widget sometimes notifications can be a bit flaky
__label__1 do not download this app aftet update all my notes was gone
__label__4 i like it but sometimes does not response correctly and need more options to do the daily use easier
__label__3 a software expert just purchased this app it's generally ok but i am not very impressed the most glaring issue is that you are confined to the app's predetermined reminder intervals you have no option to create your own time intervals i e 12 hours before 18 hours before 4 days 5 days before etc they say this app is customizable as long as it's the developers choice of customizations look elsewhere if you want total customization i'll look for more deficiencies and report back
__label__4 i wish there was a task manager only reason for 1 star drop otherwise this app is working great for me
__label__1 i have been wanting to try out this app for a while i registered and everything is going great until i get to the character maker screen i am unable to see my charcter and the customization options will send photos if needed will change rating once this is fixed
__label__5 awsome
__label__1 very confusing
__label__1 buggy won't let me edit rewards no
__label__5 its perfect i really recommend downloading it it has the priority of your works calendar etc thank you so much it is so useful
__label__3 edit you have to buy the pro version if you want to sync your calendar which to me is an essential component of a time planning app
__label__3 i am running this app on a droid turbo with stock lollipop installed the app has a very nice layout but unfortunately i find it to be very buggy it is impossible to create an event that includes monday and the app can't import recurring events from google calendar i have reported these to the developers and hope the app is cleaned up soon
__label__3 i like this app i really do however one caveat i feel is that it can only sync to a gmail or the native phones calendar outlook calendars are not supported as far as i can tell so for me i work with outlook thus any meetings etc cant be viewed seamlessly with respect to a current timeline plan
__label__5 excellent plan your day by the hour this is what i've been looking for for years also tick tick supports some amazing innovative widget modes
__label__3 used it twice so far so good
__label__2 i've been trying to figure out how to have a custom time set for the add notification options and there doesn't seem to be any way for example i need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes but there's no option for that we need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want instead of only having presets edit now after using it for a while the app has been plagued with reliability issues it often is late with the notification by a few minutes or the service completely stops and i'd have to restart the service due to this issue i cannot rely on this app for anything that is time sensitive because i'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs i've contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven't been able to fix the issue
__label__4 so far so good i just need to remember to look at it
__label__1 doesn't let me add even one item to my day without buying the pro version
__label__5 habit trackers makes it easy to keep track of your goals love it
__label__3 i set an event and told it to remind me an hour before it didn't remind me and i ended up missing my doctors appointment not good
__label__1 it slow down my flow when i turned on or click via home page widget there is a fade in effect or lagging please kindly help check thank you
__label__5 great app if you keep it to a short list of achievable habits fun to use good statistics for tracking progress you can input things retroactively if you forget at the time has dark theme customization options when it comes to tasks skills and characteristics lightweight easy to use overall i don't think i have any complaints it delivers what if says it does well no more no less tldr love it
__label__3 ui too complicated not very user friendly
__label__1 can't rely for reminders no alarm comes even if i select alarm because of relying on this app i missed an important task
__label__5 very awesome so far i really love how customizable this is it does so much it takes a while to learn how to utilize all the features but i am super happy hope it continues to be great with continued use
__label__4 great app only one disadvantage no backup possible
__label__3 lately doesn't sync between web app and android reminders well still a nice app but that is an inconvenience
__label__5 fine apk
__label__3 please add an option to enable things in the 'planned' to 'my day' makes life a lot easier it'll make the app less stubborn and more user friendly
__label__5 this app and google add on is amazing even the free version however the new widget is worse than the old one one major reason i say that is because the old version allowed overdue tasks to be rescheduled with a single touch in this new one so far you have to go back into the app
__label__5 this app has helped me develop and stick to many useful habits highly recommend it to anyone who wants to develop a new habit but is finding it difficult
__label__3 some nice features here their approach really set it apart from the other i've tried so far it's a strong contender as a wunderlist replacement the only reason i am still not confident on a switch is their wear integration it's terrible the app doesn't listen to the watch at all i've tried completing and snoozing and it does nothing the watch app can only add tasks so the screenshots they're sharing here are deceptive i also wish i could hide completed task instead of deleting
__label__1 awsome application i purched it but i just want notifation should be blinking on phone like alram clock plz add this type of features the thing diplys in notifaction should be flash on main screen from last 10 month it's not getting synchronising plz do something developer we paid for it
__label__5 this app helps me a lot
__label__1 its isnt responding it wont work
__label__4 do you have any plan to make desktop view i am using pro and pretty happy except that part getting more info for schedules and it would be amazing if it provides desktop view a bit inconvenient as a one who is relying on this app a lot
__label__1 high background usage sorry can't waste my battery spyware like this
__label__3 i wanted to give the app more stars as i love the concept but it's so buggy especially with the dailies feature all the dailies are linked together somehow there are some things i do mon sat for instance but not on sundays but when i set a task to not repeat on sunday it sets all tasks that way very frustrating
__label__1 i am a loyal user of wunderlist switching to to do is awful could not function at all for instance no list for today and week i guess i have to find another app
__label__1 like another commenter said just installed it on new phone and even though signed in it doesn't give my my paid for premium previous phone checked the sync and last sync was 128 days ago
__label__2 the sorting option is not good there's no option to manually arrange individual tasks when you show completed tasks it all over the place completed tasks should be grouped together and displayed at the bottom of the list after the incomplete tasks it becomes very messy when completed and incomplete tasks are mixed together why tweak the app to make it worse than what it was before tweaking should making it better not worse
__label__1 why this app requires so much of settings in one time 1 like it should be in recent apps 2 if internet is off it doesn't works 3 even though all the permissions to app is allowed in phone settings than to it crashes it requires an immediate update with all the bugs fixed soon or people wouldn't even write a review they would uninstall the app and find better alternatives
__label__3 wish you could sync google calendar
__label__4 excellent calender supplement i've been using ticktick along side my long term callander google calender as a planner for my daily tasks and university timetable and it's been nothing short of amazing life changing might sound like a stretch but it's helped me a tonne when it comes to getting stuffz done only thing i'd ask for is more options or a separate way of planning things like a university timetable to make it faster to add classes etc
__label__2 new update to the widget makes it so i can no longer get into the full app by tapping on the widget i actually have to go into my list of apps or create a whole other shortcut you tout a fully operational widget but i can't rearrange my list entries via the widget only the full app menu and it was already a pain to rearrange my tasks in the first place i really really wish there was an option to add new tasks to the top of the list rather than the bottom i will be trying out new to do list apps now
__label__2 it's just a simple to do list why did you locked some tools
__label__3 beautiful widgets in month view i would prefer colored bars with text inside the same as for full day events syncing with ms exchange pros calendar far better then samsung calendar cons tasks completely missing five stars down
__label__3 seems like it could have been great for me however lack of ability to modify repeating schedule e g which days of the week is a blocker switched to habithub for now
__label__1 why do i need to pay for basic features such as showing your tasks in month view it's a calendar app those are stuff you need to see can't believe you need to pay premium for a calendar todo app to show your freaking todos in the calendar
__label__1 will not let me register tried uninstalling and reinstalling tried both the email login and the facebook login
__label__3 informative but extremely slow
__label__3 good concept works fine helps to avoid phone addiction but the problem with this app is that it crashes everytime when updated several times i installed and then uninstalled it that led to loss of data and time tried your way not available in my device problem still persists
__label__2 i could not figure out how to set reminders and i did not want to register
__label__3 it's perfect but always hanging
__label__3 ok found the root cause if i use cleaner application it will turn off the app now back to normal thanks
__label__3 plz help it says m typing wrong passcode it is not opening with my old passcode
__label__2 great app but waaay to complicated deleted it and replaced with a different simpler app interface looks cool though
__label__4 good app but need to something more
__label__3 please use wunderlist' s ui starred items move to top and the division between done and to do tasks was perfect for groceries lists it destroys the purpose of these functions otherwise
__label__2 earlier it was great but now keeps crashing
__label__2 i can't even enter the shop i want to get more trees but the app just keeps loading
__label__5 useful app convenient interface
__label__3 gud way to keep in track of our habits
__label__5 love it helps keep my mind monkeys on task
__label__2 don't know how to use
__label__1 i have purchased pro version i plant a tree for an hour and come after an hour to see the forest destroyed it has happened more than 3 times i even left the phone on the app itself kindly fix this when you don't get to see the reward after 3 hours of productive time it really gets irritating and makes me think why did i even purchase this app kindly help
__label__1 i cant even get on thing on the opening page much less start a list
__label__1 i am unable to subscribe app payment method declined
__label__4 like the app but instead of monthly payment it should have been a one time app purchase
__label__2 loved this app until i updated updated it gibberish on every day now it is terrible like this on my phone and tablet how do i fix i depend on this planner
__label__3 good but not ok
__label__4 good apps to sync with my google calendar the only problem is that it couldn't sync google reminder
__label__2 multiple account support without unified view really disappointing
__label__3 the tasks completed are no longer shown on the date itself which made us hard to trace back what were the activities done on that particular day add on review thanks for the reply but when i check on my calendar completed tasks are no longer shown i'm not sure we are on the same page yes they are still on the task list but no longer in calendar
__label__2 couldn't login with facebook
__label__1 since you have put advertisements in app i say goodbye on top of that an update came up and isn't possible to view description of booked day unless you click on it disappointed
__label__3 good
__label__1 was really enjoying the app but now the widgets stopped working
__label__1 can anyone tell me how to use this app
"__label__3 this is a really good app it's what i'm looking for but i wish it was 
available offline so that i could add edit my tasks to dos habits and 
rewards"
__label__3 full package for idr 139000 got a 33 discount but still idr 139000
__label__4 easy to use and very useful especially spending lots of time at home at the moment
__label__3 good
__label__4 the ios app is lot better than this please improve it as soon as possible
__label__1 need premium level to import wunderlist b s have to reset password everytime to login so haven't been able to even try the app
__label__3 please add exchange tasks google like automatic scheduling would be a great add on
__label__3 this app seemed to have almost everything i needed for task listing i like that it allows you to mark tasks as in progress and have subtasks etc but i missed a very important meeting because it didn't synch from my google calendar even though i had refreshed multiple times i wouldn't rely on this as your only planner have another app for your calendar also
__label__1 pesters me to rate it immediately one star
__label__5 i've always been wanting one of these
__label__5 i get notifications on time and this app has various features including pomodoro all in one super happy with the present
__label__4 the one major short coming of this app and most other habit trackers is that it does not have any option to calculate a total number amount of hours etc for a week or month only a number of days or per day that is a gaping deficit in these app's with the exception of one or two with less desirable formats as it is a far better way to track things like sleep which may fluctuate from day to day the other dismaying factor is that habitbull doesn't seem to have any customer service as i e mailed numerous times about issues trying to upgrade because it is a really helpful useful application and never got any response in about a year's time aside from the tabulation inadequacy discussed above which i really hope they'll address include that capability it is a really helpful and useful app and can be especially helpful for people with issues such as depression or ocd who may have difficulty keeping a handle on self care and or productivity though it could also have the opposite effect if people with ocd get too immersed in tracking things in their day to day s in general it is a good tool to have though and can help you make a lot of progress on things like household projects etc but i really do wish that they'd adjust it so that you can calculate a total for a duration of time longer than a day and that they would also be conscientious about customer service support and responding to fielding correspondence and issues people encounter kristin star
__label__3 it was ok
__label__3 right after installing i noticed that whitelisting apps is such an important and basic feature which you made available only for premium users this is such a ridiculous decision for a google play editor's choice app that im not even gonna bother trying your app any more than 1 minute update no it's unacceptable that your development team didn't predict the flow of new installations and didn't include any kind of trial period but fine i'll up my rating to 3 neutral
__label__1 reminders are a premium feature are you kidding me this is an absolute deal breaker i deleted after trying for 2 minutes
__label__4 very helpful
__label__5 i have been enjoying this app for a good while over a year now the recent update moved this app from ok useful with some mild frustration to amazing super pleased with this fix
__label__3 this application is good in a way that you can prioritize and organize your tasks the thing is that the important features such as the 'alarm' for notification of reminders and sharing of documents are only allowed in premium package and as a student i would not be able to avail these features monthly i wish that you can add a feature wherein you can personalize your notes so it will be more fun and exciting to use
__label__4 good
__label__4 awesome app really especially for students managing their time my friend actually introduced it to me and i would be glad that we could view each others' profil without using the pro thing like we can remain focuse together even if we don't live near each other
__label__3 there needs to be a feature to purge completed tasks its cumbersome to to have to delete them one by one or by selected all and deselecting the upcoming tasks potential to delete active tasks
__label__3 enjoying the app
__label__1 not very user friendly atleast for me the alarm doesnt ring it on only vibrates i have to put every thing manually like if its 11 am in the clock it gives me optionts what i m going to do from 12 pm and even after using it for a week i am not clear how dis format gonna helm me
__label__4 it's a good way to keep track of your habits habits are easy to change if you decide to track something different
__label__1 if it's a passion project i'd be willing to support the creator but this seems to now be held by just a shell holding
__label__4 awesome app very helpful and does its purpose very well just wish it was free or a one time purchase
__label__5 great and handy
__label__3 the hourly reminders don't work properly they show up sometimes and sometimes they don't it's unreliable that way otherwise the app is quite nice
__label__5 i use this app as a recommendation from some writer in medium i've been using for a month and it's amazing i can plan and complete all my tasks
__label__1 couldn't import gtasks lists beyond initial install didn't receive any support doesn't show in google calandar
__label__2 mota moti
__label__4 good
__label__2 it has deleted all of my entries planned for today i am going to try a new app
__label__1 functionality for which i paid has been removed in android 10 i am sick tired of this stuff going on
__label__1 could not get the app to save event time properly all i wanted was to put a due date between 11 50 p m and 11 59 p m on a certain day would not do it the app kept automatically changing my times that's annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on
__label__2 please fix the widget it keeps failing to display tasks and asks to restart all the time
__label__5 great app love it
__label__5 cool app gives me a good overview of the day and useful also for timeboxing thanks
__label__4 very good job would like option for completed habits to hide for the day and option to edit categories names icons and colours
__label__3 good but why is there no widget i just recently decided to try this app again i like the reminders unlike some other users this feature works fine for me i also like that alexa has a skill for it so i can just tell alexa to add something to my list and it's added the only thing i would remove a star for is no widget i dont want to have to open the app every time to see what's on my list
__label__5 i love this app i've always had a hard time with planners because i just couldn't see the point but that allows me to plan and have fun i feel like i'm constantly playing a video game but the main character is me it has definitely improved my life thanks a ton developers
__label__5 one of the best apps ever for time management
__label__1 i paid for this app and it was a wonderful app easy platform customisable but there has been a recent addition of ads all the time for an app i have paid for i think this is disgusting i response to you no these aren't spam events linked to my phone i uninstalled this app and used my original paid version of the called app and there are no ads i was prompted to update to this version a while ago i thought it was just an ad on from the paid version of business calendar i had
__label__1 please remove the facebook tracking code for facebook places and facebook analytics this is a serious privacy flaw exposing users locations app usage and other personal information to a notorious international privacy abuser
__label__1 busted from the start on the first open of the app i got a 3 pane swipe intro and the first 2 were blank purple screens then on the avatar creation screen the avatar wasn't visible when finally getting in to the app the help text bubble didn't point at anything just the bottom of the screen for the whole dialogue this app sounded interesting but it seems there's a complete lack of interest in quality
__label__4 it really is worth it to download this app thank you for designing this wonderful app thnks so much
__label__4 and this is definitely a good app for finding out your full day from start to finish in great detail it has some pretty nice visual effects too
__label__5 superb app my one piece of advice for others would be to set low reasonable targets for yourself and slowly increase them over time much better to start going to the gym twice a week succeed and increase from there than to set the goal of 7 days a week and fail and become disheartened when you dont hit it app is superb though
__label__5 after many years of android finally found the perfect task app plenty of category and reminder options and seamless sync to the cloud with a web based interface
__label__4 you have to pay to pay monthly sync across devices it should be a one time cost edit you know what streve i was greedy everthing else is free but interdevice sync is a standard in most apps so the lack of the option is a real down side and now i have to switch app and it's not that i'm not willing to pay i just want it to be a one time cost and i still won't pay the price for your years subscription even if it was for a lifetime of use so i'll give you 4 stars but leave the app
__label__1 not worth it don't buy
__label__3 the app keeps stopping repeatedly it would be helpful if the same is resolved
__label__2 lately the ads have doubled in frequency have become full screen noisy and more difficult to close while the overall usability have decreased quite shame and before telling the it's free slogan think that annoyed people will delete not buy
__label__4 fun and productive
