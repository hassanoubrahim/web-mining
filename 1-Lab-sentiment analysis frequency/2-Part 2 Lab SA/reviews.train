__label__5 easy to use and very helpful i love it
__label__1 too complicated it probably has a lot of but it's not intuitive enough
__label__2 the app is constantly loading and you can't even record your habits and reminders don't work also having just 5 habits free is bad too
__label__4 ok
__label__5 best todo app i've used ever i love the concept of starting each day afresh makes me feel like i'm actually accomplishing something unlike when you see the same task on your list day after day after day
__label__5 osm app
__label__2 the app has stopped synching and cant get it working very frustrating i paid for premium and no one replies to help resolve which is a real shame as the actual app when working is very good
__label__4 very intuitive app
__label__5 i have searched lots of app for goal planning this one is best of them easy to use
__label__3 very nice looking the pricing is just right and i love that you can have subtasks upon subtasks but almost nothing about it is intuitive for an app that is all about helping the user be more productive to have a new or occasional user blundering around poking and prodding until the app lets them accomplish basic tasks well that is obviously detrimental to productivity and a surefire way to accidentally encourage customer churn ux test your app please
__label__3 i can say this is a nice app i often see this app on so many study videos but i just start to use this app now and when i plant the tree i can still open other apps and the tree didn't die please help
__label__5 awesome experience motivational helped in studies and health fitness also in stress management
__label__1 not user friendly directly asking for money i already uninstalled
__label__2 i have been using this for a while and found it to suit my needs well i wanted something where i could see trasks and appointments in a daily view this accomplished that goal in an easy to read and navigate format however there must have been a recent update that has made the ads ridiculously invasive to the point that i no longer want to use this app i think i will start checking on alternate options
__label__3 ads were annoying and it took a lot of steps to set up tasks however it was nifty to use and definitely allowed a lot of control due to the aforementioned steps
__label__2 i really want to love this app but it won't even let me select pm so its constantly telling me its past the due date which makes the app very useless to me
__label__5 this app is literally like a dream come true it is girly and has all of the things a paper planner has but electronically i love it
__label__1 what appealed to me the most about this app was the promise that we get to see the clock on your home screen however the settings doesn't offer that option now it's just another app callendar you have to tap to see what's coming up i liked the idea i could just turn on my phone and bang the clock would just simply show me my schedule idk if it's a bug or just a false promise either way it's disappointing
__label__4 awesome upgrade from wunderlist i couldn't expect i can live without wunderlist i just give it a try and now i don't regret for it truly a great successor of wunderlist but if u can please make the font size customization option it will be really helpful
__label__2 cancel means stop the action not throw away all the notes i just made sorry but this was suppse to save time not waste ideas and planning poor comms from app on a normalized ui function first go and really turned me off could be lots more awesome but things like this and not being able to recover the info quickly then not acceptable when doing business tasks nowadays
__label__5 best timetable app but i want you suggest that upcoming timeline we can see in notification bar it makes app more better for all
__label__3 when you start a habit with giving points for it or like at least that and that amount of days you can't just change it back to a simple yes and no habit
__label__2 useless i dont want to purchase the app as this free version offers no good features the paid app might be better rating 2 just because of the feedback on user review
__label__3 good interface and design but the sharing capabilities were riddled with issues the app became almost unusable if you tried to share anything
__label__4 forest is a gamification of the pomodoro technique it's more helpful than other pomodoro type apps the vibration notification is too long and loud otherwise an excellent app
__label__1 hard to set up
__label__5 i've never been so pleased with an app like this it designed well easy to navigate and keeps me motivated to improve my life
__label__5 this app has helped me a lot and is all in all one of the best apps i know there's just one suggestion i have many habits and dailies hence i have to scroll a lot it would be amazing if there was an option to change the layout so you can have a better overview
__label__2 awesome app the only missing thing is that you can only set a date i would like to have buttons to remind me later on the day or on the next day or next week update no what i meant is that i want to say remind me today and not remind me at date today at specific time update i would then receive the notification at a specific time 5 hours later or something that can be altered in the settings and also i don't want to put in a date look at the app ticktick has exactly what i want
__label__3 it's good for me
__label__5 this honestly makes tracking my daily life and staying responsible so much more fun having rewards is a great way to remind people that it's important to reward yourself for your hard work i'm a really competitive person so this is really handy for actually getting myself to do things even if the reward is small it's still gratifying to level up for not skipping uni or using the treadmill super rad and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a more fun life tracking app b
__label__1 i've been told that wunderlist is being replaced by microsoft to do what a sad replacement why on earth are they mucking up a great product for this the whole look and feel of the app is terrible the functioning of the app has changed too good bye from a long standing user
__label__3 you need to improve the responsiveness to the touch
__label__3 the free app works well but pops up with annoying notifications every now and then to remind you to set more reminders kind of pointless i'm also not a fan of the subscription model for premium the layout and app itself is good though so it's a shame about those negatives i would have considered buying if there was a one time payment model
__label__1 i have never been delighted by a microsoft app and this is no different a simple to do list app and i must have a microsoft account no thanks good luck
__label__3 i have appointments on the internal calendar that don't show on here this includes new ones and ones i made months ago no point in using this if i have to check another app to find all of my appointments
__label__4 all of the free features are really good and i am way more organized
__label__3 how soon until the list sharing is available if soon you have just earned a small business customer
__label__5 i love that this app combines all of my various calendars work and personal to have a quick total view of my day s such a timesaver
__label__2 cant complete subtasks through widget huge turn off
__label__1 can't use it without registering with your email address immediate uninstall
__label__1 would not let me create a log in
__label__3 overall i like this app and i am wondering if i should pay for the premium version because there are serious limitations on the free one no notes or labels but there is one thing that annoys me the impossibly to control the view settings it would be better if they had options to change the size of panels and size of fonts and smaller spacing between each entry it would allow for a better overall view and or permit to view more things at once and reduce wasted space of the left sidebar
__label__5 great app i might edit this later but i'm too lazy to go into detail right now
__label__3 great app intuitive navigation easy to use nice integration with other apps what's up with the lavender color designation i didn't think that lavender would look turquoise
__label__5 great 1
__label__2 the layout was good but it only lets you track 5 habits for free
__label__3 it's a cool way of getting at a glance your schedule the theme could be more colorful
__label__1 please remove the facebook tracking code for facebook places and facebook analytics this is a serious privacy flaw exposing users locations app usage and other personal information to a notorious international privacy abuser
__label__1 i have used this app for months on a daily basis and was finding it really useful however the app recently forced me to do an update and all my tasks were deleted as a result as were the specific categories i set up i tried deleting the app fully and redownloading it to see if that helped but my tasks still didn't reappear even though my diary is syncing ok i have lost over 80 tasks and can't remember all the info included in each task it has shaken my faith in using the app again particularly as i haven't received a response to the message i sent the team via the support link several days ago now
__label__2 this app is fine but after sometime it won't open and i don't know why besides this problem it works amazing i would have given it 5 stars but i'm giving it 2 just because of the problem
__label__2 too much configuration not very intuitive i'm looking for something simple that only counts something for the day not to set goals reminders notes and all that overload of information that keep jumping from screen to screen not looking for enterprise app just for personal use
__label__3 ticktick is one of my favourite productivity app but suddenly the habit tracker doesn't work or respond properly
__label__1 app was good in past but not anymore it has stopped sync and many bugs creeped in due to no maintenance and update since as per details in app page last update was on 28th jun 2018 but still it is the first thing that comes in results when i search for habit i guess google should stop advertising an app that is not managed since years
__label__3 it's really handy for specific dates and categories but i would love it if there were more customising and theme options that are not for the premium package
__label__2 sync is not good
__label__3 shows monthly when startup even after changing it in the settings to show weekly otherwise all around good app
__label__1 used the free version for years no issues didn't need the pro features then they started putting in ads not the kind that pop up along the bottom but ones that completely hijack the screen while you're trying to work worst bait and switch i've ever seen
__label__2 after recent update notifications messed up sometimes i can't turn it off so it rings until you reset the device
__label__2 it lets me get out of app and my tree is still growing it doesnt prevent me from using phone
__label__5 i like the fact that i have an account so if i switch phones i can keep everything i worked for
__label__3 app idea and design is great but it is not possible to add calendar from work profile account anyhow it is just invisible android 7 1 1 promise rating 5 if fixed upd thanks for prompt reply but it is about google calendar in work profile it creates a separate copies of google apps for it please have a look at work profile specifics for android 7
__label__1 upgraded and lost all my tasks from previous version very disappointed
__label__1 will not be using ever again
__label__1 this app keeps on signing me out and asking for my password and then when i put it in it says it's wrong wunderlist was so much better
__label__3 a lot of bugs for an app that tells you to pay to support its development
__label__5 as per expected
__label__2 it only works when linked to another calendar app and it's difficult to change the time from am to pm
__label__5 the ui is incredibly intuitive and there are so many ways to organize your tasks
__label__2 i think i could really like this app except i upgraded to paid and still have ads and the search function does not search notes it will be hard to find info saved in notes if you cant search
__label__3 does not sync with google
__label__1 1 star for obligatory signup using google fb twitter
__label__3 worked great in beginning enjoy multiple lists sublists but now i have a task haunting me it won't let me delete it wrote developers we'll see using sg8
__label__1 i'm sure the dev is well intended just no for me ux is terrible
__label__3 some time it's not working not reminding me
__label__2 this does not work the same as wunderlist when i sort i cannot manually move items to in effect do a sort alphabetically within priority also when i prioritize items they don't automatically move to the top of the list with wunderlist going away i am going to have to search for a new app so disappointed
__label__3 wish i could track more than 5 habits without paying
__label__2 convoluted way of editing sub tasks and the undo button only works in te immediate moment after checking stats can't be reset all the little thingd take a long time to set up due to the way interface is handled it's also weird how 'done' can't be hidden
__label__3 reminder notification tone is very low in volume
__label__1 i couldn't figure out a way to sync with my google tasks and then now the app won't uninstall from my watch
__label__4 this is a good app with loads of potential it integrates really well with google calendar with the only slight disadvantage that you can't choose to hide or dismiss all day events the widget is great and the notifications seem to work well i look forward to seeing more updates
__label__1 play tune does not work on gionee
__label__5 simple allows you to manipulte lists sub catagories first one ive found that really works for me
__label__4 great app for setting up to do list and setting skills very similar to liferpg differing only in ui and the addition of achievements in my opinion stuck with the other one of the basis of not wanting to pay a subscription for an app would prefer one off payment to unlock features
__label__3 not fully developed this app could be great but in their rush to put it out the features are highly lacking no push notifications you cannot upload stickers no widget pretty buggy i really liked the idea of it but it needs improvement i will update to 5 stars if and when these features are added they did reach out to me to resolve my issues so i am updating to three stars
__label__3 great i just wish i can move it to another device with out having to by it again
__label__2 can't drag n reorder lists on widget which is a big issue for me google assistant integration poor at best very awkward it's easily confused doesnt move tasks and generally doesn't work for me
__label__3 i preferred wunderlist i wish ms kept more of its functionality
__label__3 great app but there are constant bugs in the widget cannot add tasks from the widget selecting the list to display in the widget is too sensitive and often redirects you back to the app instead of the list select drop down
__label__4 some functionality is not seamless there is no feature to order the tasks in a custom order or group tasks within a list
__label__5 this initially looks a bit confusing however this design actually functions extremely well the way it can act as both a clock date alarm and agenda widget at the same time is just incredibly efficient it also provides you with a very easy way to evaluate at which times of the day you have events and more importantly when you have breaks and how long they are all this at a glance compared to clunky agenda widgets where you have to sit and calculate it in your head well worth the money
__label__3 sometimes it shows wrong time make me confused most of the time
__label__3 1 apart from events how to import reminders from google calendar app 2 how to import the tasks from google tasks app
__label__2 it sorely needs and undo backup restore revert feature in case we accidentally touch swipe a circle bullet which then gets unintentionally deleted immediately which i find incredibly frustrating it also needs a flexible feature to import export other common text data formats like csv xml events to from calendar not just copy reminders to tasks if google fixes all that then i'd give it 5 stars
__label__4 thought one drive would be included in the cloud list
__label__1 to much cost
__label__5 i've been using it for a week now i like how i can break down a task into sub tasks very helpful
__label__3 dont try this they limting everythings for the premium
__label__4 in this last update there is a bug in a widget i enter the event and then i press the top left corner arrow to go into the main app it just exits update the latest update doesn't fix this
__label__5 best app
__label__4 i really like this app it helps me focus with my tasks and study but hope you get rid of the messenger pop ups i could still get notifications and able to view it without losing a plant but overall i love it
__label__1 too much confusion not able to understand
__label__5 this is the best to do list also growing your karma level is fun
__label__3 good but not fully free
__label__1 a subscription for an app that simple are you insane it should be a one time payment no more around 3 4 this is my advice to you you won't last long with this kind of strategy
__label__3 very nice
__label__1 hard to use if we could make some changes just by sliding the clock or smthn that would be awesome
__label__2 no adding option for the time
__label__1 took before the renewal date have not recieved my refund and canceled on the due date
__label__3 i'm still trying it out but so far it has helped a lot one would not waste time if they have this app in hand
__label__1 do not buy premium devs are not responsive and there is no way to reach them should you have any issues contacted them several times to transfer purchase to new phone nobody responded 10 wasted
__label__2 does this works on android 10 i tried installing it and tried to make a character but it seems it's bugging doesn't show my character from character making phase reinstalled it same thing occurred hopefully you guys can help me here cheers
__label__3 very nice
__label__3 it hard to use
__label__4 a great app but i miss a overview of week activity's the app get confusing to use after adding some tasks
__label__5 its great for people who get distracted easily
__label__2 keeps hanging even after you actually pay money for the premium version
__label__3 edit paid out good money last year to buy premium but you're still begging me to rate you well my original 5 stars becomes today's 3 stars leave me alone i rated 5 within minutes of buying old review i've purchased the premium version thank you the best in the play store edit i would appreciate it if next time you have a one day sale you make it abundantly clear in the actual app otherwise i'll never know thank you
__label__3 no option to set daily tasks as only monday to friday
__label__3 can add a reminder option withthe specified time
__label__4 great way to hold yourself accountable for setting goals
__label__2 i want to discontinue and it was monthly base they charge me yearly it's very sad pls help and refund
__label__3 this is really a great app i'm just finding difficult to put tasks in home widgets could you tell me how to do this
__label__1 dude don't we all want people to pay us for everything we come up with xxxxxxx hi thanks for the attentive reply though this app was not worth the payment or storage space for me i did find one that works nicely looking forward to more replies hopefully relevant or none at all
__label__2 stupid auto correct
__label__4 a very good rip off of liferpg taking all of the useful features of task management reward motivation and rpg style stat levels and making the ui simpler and more user friendly seems to be monetizing the idea though putting in ads and lots of in app purchases and requiring a recurring payment subscription rather than one time purchase to unlock features
__label__3 functional but not very stable
__label__4 you can add one thing when we'll touch on particular time period then the particular task should be displayed
__label__4 شكرا
"__label__3 it's well put together but the timer functionality doesn't really belong 
the controls are unintuitive and they have an arbitrary 5min minimum which 
ruined the use case i was going to use it for"
__label__5 amazing app i love how easy it is to use it automatically syncs with my calenders and the grocery list is such a plus
__label__3 so close to being perfect missing tags filters reports will definitely be keeping an eye out for these
__label__4 easy to use
__label__3 please can we go back to entering the time with numbers the clock thing is fiddly and pointless it seemd your developers don't have enough work also when i select this evening i have to select the date before messing with the time which makes no sense
__label__4 love ticktick it's almost perfect i'd love to see the following features added subtasks within subtasks like todoists option to assign repeating tasks to repeat after completion rather than due date i have an automatic cat feeder that lasts five days then i need to be reminded but if i postpone a day or two and then check it off it sets to repeat five days after the original due date instead of after i check off option to configure inbox behavior include tasks from other lists
__label__1 app has no images on s10 and is completely unusuable
__label__5 very good app but it would be nice if you add lasting tasks for an example a task that starts at 14 00 and finishes at 15 00 i hope you understood me p
__label__2 never tried it yet
__label__2 switching from one list to another stinks otherwise helpful
__label__2 le partage est tres nul cest juste un texte envoyé a l autre
__label__2 i just spent 30 minutes putting tasks into the app then went to sync the app with my google account and they all got erased
__label__3 they changed the priority colors so that instead of a gradient it now goes grey blue yellow red i don't think this is an improvement it is not immediately apparent to me which priority blue is at a glance they also took away the priority color strip on the left and replaced with a colored checkbox it looks worse to me i'm not sure this was necessary just so that the user could close out a task with a single click
__label__3 it's good to manage our time but why all event and riminder has done not delete automatically
__label__4 i really like the app i'm having an issue though where the widget doesn't populate when a new day starts i have to delete it and readd it or restart my phone
__label__4 so far it's been very helpful useful for simple lists like groceries things i need to remember to pick up for my daughter
__label__5 this app has really helped me organize my schedule and block out my routines that don't fit into other time blocks and have smaller increments of type that are hard to see in other calendar apps i would recommend using for morning and evening routines
__label__5 i am a project support officer and administrator calendars are one of my main tools every day and business calendar is definitely my favourite one neat visualisation of all information required when you juggle multiple calendars let's you add move sync colour code no functionality issues ever
__label__3 i really like the sophisticated display and the level of personalisation you can make it would get 5 stars but the default text colour for the month display widget is a dark grey that is too dark to read when using the dark theme i have to go through every entry to change them individually to a light grey so i can actually read it in the widget any help
__label__3 doesn't seem to alarm on notification you give it an alarm go back to it and it says no alarm set
__label__3 i really like this app makes life more fun foy adhd brain but sound making ads are a real pain i'm okay with the ads in general they don't pop up often enough to be annoying but can we get rid of the ones that make sound so i can stop embarrassing myself in a quiet class room after checking off an assignment
__label__3 the apss so far is the best to do apps i have use however the tag unable to sort alphabetically we hav to everytime sort manually not user friendly i will rate 5 star if can settle this problem
__label__1 can't use it without providing your email address immediate uninstall
__label__1 i have been a subscriber of the pro version for years when this new version came out i tried it and there were problems i tried it again and it seems to work well i tried running with one alarm and now it dosen't stop when i acknowledge it i'm going back to the old version i have removed pro 2 if the problem pesiststs i will have to find a new calendar very frustrated
__label__3 the feature that i liked in wunderlist is that you could move items around on your list manually this is missing from this app
__label__5 there is all in one combine i absolutely excited all function realized perfectly pomodoro tasks subtusks folders calendar availability to see all completed tasks in calendar stats formated description numerical lists bold headers etc all i need i have in this app i little bother about restrictions for free version monthly price is high enough for my using case but nowadays i don't need to buy full version app is brilliant i have checked a lot of todo dairy organizers
__label__3 i would give this app 5 stars but i am beyond frustrated with how slow it is to open i pay the subscription for premium and i love all the options in the app but it literally takes 5 to 10 minutes for the app to open unless there is a notification in my notification bar that i can open the app with this would be annoying even with a free app but to pay for a slow app that takes ages to open is ridiculous in the 2 or 3 years that i've used it this has never been fixed with any upgrade
"__label__4 this app would be so much more useful to me if i could order tasks by time 
hope you guys can fix this thank you great app good job"
__label__5 great way to keep track with voice prompts as reminders
__label__5 i love this app i've always had a hard time with planners because i just couldn't see the point but that allows me to plan and have fun i feel like i'm constantly playing a video game but the main character is me it has definitely improved my life thanks a ton developers
__label__1 bad
__label__4 great tool
__label__3 worse than wunderlist no optional add todos to top or bottom so it's pretty inconvenient for big lists
__label__3 it seems to be improved and noted no option to delete routines and need to go all the days and delete
__label__5 great app to organise all your to do tasks love it
__label__1 the last update was more than a year ago and things started to stop working the company that owns it seems to be a scam it was a great app i paid for it and got no support
__label__4 i love this app it really helps me stay focused
__label__1 very bad
__label__3 it's not syncing right with my gmail my recurring events are all messed up but are right on my gmail deciding whether to keep it or not
__label__2 despite logging out of all my google accounts and restaring my phone i still can't restore my premium account
__label__4 i love this app and has been using it for more than a year but lately it has bugs which changes the days when i opened it per days please fix it
__label__4 i liked it but is there a widget for the app
__label__4 good app
__label__4 prefering this over google calendar there is still an annoying bug where i cant edit delete events added to the calendar externally through a gym app for example pressing edit then it just goes back to the calendar view instead of to editing
__label__4 its a good app for everyday tasks it takes time to customize it and its normal because its an rpg type however i think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless you can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want this bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah
__label__3 i just started using it so i'm not sure how good it is yet i do really wish you could do bullet points like that you could check off it would be much easier in some cases than a separate sub list that is currently what i need
__label__4 i was looking for an organizer app which would provide statistics on my discipline and progress and this does it but it is missing one to me basic feature the tasks don't have a start time or duration period there is only a deadline it doesn't allow understanding easily whether the tasks overlap in time is this feature available in the premium version at least another missing feature is the location setting at least at a home work outdoors level any plans to incorporate the features
__label__3 app is slow and unresponsive makes using it a pain
__label__4 i think the app really helps you stay organized it really helped me out the only complaint i have it that you have to pay for the premium version but i mean how else are you supposed to be able to make money off of an app so
__label__3 how to equip those new purchased trees
__label__3 has trouble syncing google calendar not all events show up even after clicking sync now also tried hiding and un hiding calender but still doesn't sync
__label__3 i love the idea of it but i am having a hard time trying to get started as i am setting up my dailies anything that i set for weekly seemed like they are all linked together so if i change my days on one task it changes on something else i like what it trying to do but if this isn't corrected then i will have to find another app
__label__3 long time wunderlist user here what i feel that can definitely be improved is the snappiness with which each task list opens right now there's always a small loading delay when clicking on a given list
__label__2 did not enjoy the layout workflows rewards explanations a for the effort
__label__4 this app is so robust i love it however i would love a quick add button in the notifications
__label__1 i liked it at first even paid for it too but now it won't sync across my devices so i need to find something else that will
__label__5 it has made me more productive than ever
__label__5 i love it
__label__5 great concept but not quick to use creating events through google calendar takes time i would like to be able to use without syncing to any calendar perhaps add an option to store events locally instead of syncing to outside calendars and make that process quick and ease edit thank you i have found that option
__label__3 i had a 5 star on this but recent updates have made it far less simple to edit tasks 3x more taps first to open and then change then get out of the added window that opens also it is now impossible to select amd edit in bulk poor consideration of basic use cases on part of developers and testers
__label__4 good tool to manage one or more calendars in one view connects to gmail contacts phone google drive and more
__label__2 useful for organizing the activities of the day but don't have setting on sound to notify the time of activity
__label__3 i like it and to be honest for a free app it's pretty good my only gripe is that the home screen widget doesn't update however it's good enough for me to leave tick tick
__label__2 there ia no way to go back to the routine old interface new is ugly
__label__1 when you try to write a task and you want to set the reminder at the same time you have to make a reminder for each one and its wasting my time if i could i would rate this app 0 stars
__label__3 great concept the idea of this is great but theres a couple things that need work and i have a few ideas app is very slow or laggy sometimes it wont let me click on the sugested address also would be useful to be able to click address in planner and pull up directions in google map i would also like to be able to link a list to a event and or address would also like to be able to build my desired layout more themes and stickers
__label__3 i really like this app and find it useful for keeping me on track simple but effective i used the free version for almost 2 years at the end of the first year it reset and i lost all of my history so before the end of the second year i bought the premium version and promptly lost all of my history again i contacted support to see if they could help and got no response at all i still recommend it for tracking your habits but don't expect to keep the info long term or get help if you need it
__label__2 doesn't connect at all pls fix it
__label__5 it's one of the best time management app just love it
__label__4 it is a great app love the design and the possibilities but it really needs tk have a setting to change the hour configuration from a clock to keyboard so we can edit the event and routines in a split screen
__label__3 planner isnt saving all day events you can see an event is there in month view but when you open that day the event does not show
__label__3 why does it require access to photos and media
__label__2 i installed it and used it only once after tht i cant open it please help me i really want to use it bcs i've already purchase for premium and i dont want my money to go on waste
__label__3 minimum 3 stars no real problems so far nothing to compare it to but its bright and keeping me organized
"__label__3 there should be an option to undo last action for accidentally pressing 
the wrong button"
__label__3 i wanted to ask if we receive any coins if we plant trees for a long period of time because when i planted a tree for 2 hours i didn't receive any coins is this intentional or a bug
__label__3 why can't you add an attachment
__label__1 i've feel deceived by this app there's no assistant the whatsapp integration doesn't work also i contacted support and got no answer i'm cancelling my subscription
__label__2 ah yes wanna use an advanced calendar well turns out you must have an account for that what's that your eyes are burning under this bright theme well we have a solution just for you as you have seen in our tips you can change the theme oh w o p s no you can't how silly of us to not tell you in tips that buy our premium maybe it's just not what i was looking for
__label__4 its a neat app
__label__4 i like the way it separates lists sub lists horizontally and i can switch between them conveniently with swipes though i tend to accidentally delete tasks when trying to switch lists i value the convenience of swipe to delete the most being able to quick add tasks from the main screen removes one extra tap step being able to highlight important tasks but wish it would automatically pin them to the top feature i wish most for image attachments idea location based reminders
__label__5 i absolutely love this app i am a sorter at heart so being able to divide my list into the different sections of my life is very helpful i also love that i can add others people to my lists this helps me keep everyone on the same page thank you microsoft for helping me organize my life
__label__3 good start would love to see clean material design implemented personally i need the option of a full task list view in my task widget again good start
__label__1 i purchased the pro version in my motorola g5 plus than uninstalled it now i can't even get that purchase back i understand it happening between two different devices but i'm still using same device please help with it
__label__3 useless have to pay a subscription to be reminded no thank you honestly a once off fee is fair but a continued yearly fee i can see why these guys partnered with facebook and mark suckerberg to suck your wallet i gave it 3 stars because it is a well made app
__label__2 how to do so the link is not opening only
"__label__3 the widget is not getting updated until i go into the application the app 
is good but this is irritating please fix this i have already bought pro 
and widget pallete"
__label__1 when you try to write a task and you want to set the reminder at the same time you have to make a reminder for each one and its wasting my time if i could i would rate this app 0 stars
__label__2 the features that were used to convince me to install all require premium access will not buy something with so little real use testing
__label__5 this app was exactly what i expected to organise my time thanks
__label__3 disappointed had the app installed for a few weeks only i was enjoying it and improving my life and suddenly it stopped working i keep getting notifications saying that there's no connection i can't log anything and once i decided to reinstall again and again i can't even log in anymore the screen won't load and it never goes past the login register screen
__label__1 for years i use ticktick i love it so much i rated it 5 in play store but the recent several changes to the app are make the app getting worse and keep getting worse than before i incredibly sad and disappointed for years i rely on ticktick as my todolist app and now i have to find other alternative that can be as good as ticktick that i know before that's not an easy thing to do
__label__3 easy to use
__label__1 reminders are a premium feature enough said
__label__5 loving how this is organized
__label__5 i love this app fyi although it is a free to use app i dont remember seeing a single ad definietely reccomend
__label__3 this app was a life saver for me but its not working properly with my new oneplus 7 it doesn't gives reminders which i set for whatever time i get it once in a while but most of the time no reminder please provide a solution for this asap thanks edit 7 7 it started working now all i did was in the battery settings selected any do app n selected the option dont optimize in it
__label__5 love ticktick it's the perfect organization tool for me so well designed and has all the features i need well done
__label__3 it's a good time planner controller
__label__3 still testing
__label__5 if you use google calendar and like circular visualizations of your schedule this is a must have i paid the premium charge for the full set of features so i can see a 24 hour calendar view and i'm going to buy and wear os smartwatch to use this app's smartwatch sync feature to see my widget on both my watch and home screen perfect
__label__3 hello i recently shifted to a new phone i have a premium membership but i am unable to transfer my data to the new phone please help
__label__3 i accidently deleted an item then screen rotated and undo option did not appear developers please preserve state of the app between rotations
__label__4 it helped me a lot to stay ahead of my schedule a productive app but after some time some reminders don't work and i have to set them again
__label__5 edit nope changing it to 5 stars anyway it's great right now and will be brilliant when the web integration is implemented thank you stephen incredible work absolutely love this app and found it far more suited to my needs than any of the bigger to do apps looking forward to signing up for the paid version and giving 5 stars when the web integration is rolled out then it will be absolutely perfect
__label__4 hey guys the new update messed up the widget layout for me now everything is smaller and more difficult to read
__label__3 i went from touching the app once a day to once a week over the span of about 2 months would be better if notifications were functional could be enabled i like the concept of being a hero though i just always fail all my daily set tasks repeatedly back to level 0 hahaha i stick to my sticky notes app with reminders that i've been using for years edit 11 10 19 i see notifications on appear on my phone now thank you
__label__4 only been using couple days so far so good easy to get the hang of some functionality aspects could be enhanced but overall v glad to be with this app
__label__5 a fun way too self check your own habits smashing support staff help and guide you you can meet like minded people who are sharing connections and fun in this quaint yet challenging game app if nothing else i'm remembering my meds on time enjoy finding your fun habits see you in habitica the adventure is there for the taking
__label__3 very useful and simple nothing too fancy but still fun no complicated features i love the multiple lists options and sub category lists only glitch i find is returning to previous pages after typing often i have to just hit my home button and navigate all the way back to where i was but nothing too bad
__label__5 phew the transition from wunderlist went just fine everything is imported and after a bit of tweaking in the settings the app works like wunderlist did and the app icon is easy to find
__label__3 great concept
__label__2 too hard
__label__1 after few months it started not checking the task i mean i check and few hours later it is unchecked it should be cleared and the next date for the same task should be displayed example task 1 to date 01 jan 2019 and repeat task 1 to date 01 feb 2019 after checking the task for january the task for february should be displayed but after some time the task for january is unchecked
__label__3 great app but as someone else mentioned there's no calendar view which for me makes it pointless real shame the search goes on
__label__3 hi i change start day of week in the sitting but in the repeat option when i check the skip weekend the program skip saturday and sunday if first day of week is saturday then thursday and friday are weekend please fix it for 5 stars this is very important thanks
__label__3 i have enjoyed this calendar for 9mths so much so i paid to go pro now 3weeks on it no longer syncs events older than two weeks and i need to refer back further the app blames google for the limitations but i now have another calendar that syncs back 3yrs so nothing to do with google there used to be an option on bc to syncs all events past and future but this option is no longer available really disappointed as was a good app see how you get on but don't waste your money upgrading like i did
__label__4 удобный наглядный трекер привычек с подробной кастомизацией к сожалению не всегда корректно срабатывают напоминания во всплывающем окне не нажимаются кнопки приходится переходить в приложение чтобы отметить выполненное действие
__label__1 it's not working unfortunately at first it was reflecting then when i added more items it's no longer working it just keeps adding the data in the calendar but no graph is being created
__label__5 perfect time tune is simple customizable and incredibly useful i've been searching for an app like this for a very very long time thank you
__label__3 loved todoist but the new widget is a massive step backward for me can't multiselect and reschedule multiple tasks anymore
__label__5 really intuitive works great simplified my life highly recommended
__label__5 great app been wanting a routine type ap for awhile definitely nice to have for my schedual
__label__5 exactly what i was looking for to help establish routines i like that i can set it to place habits on certain days and don't manually have to readd them my only suggestion is to be able to manually sort items
__label__5 i truly literally honestly would not be able to keep track of my life without this app i have seven calendars and a task list synced to my device i'm able to color code each calendar and appointments within those calendars plus add emojis if i need an appointment to pop the android widget is fantastic mine is set as my home screen so i always see what's coming up cannot recommend this app more highly i would give 50 stars if the option was available
__label__3 best
__label__3 this app is a fantastic idea but man is it buggy i'm constantly having to restart the app or check it later because it's bugging out would be 5 stars otherwise
__label__2 kind of ha are to get the hang of maybe i'm just stupid idk but i never did figure it out
__label__1 updated to android 10 makes this app could allow me to go to other app pls fix this bug
__label__4 excellent calendar worth the upgrade
__label__3 i would've given it full cuz its an amazing app and i would recommend it but the down is that it takes too long to set a schedule otherwise it is an awesome app
__label__5 it's fun and easy to use
__label__5 this app is exceptionally great i wanted to shift on google tasks due to it's integration all over the place but this app is also cross platform compatible ticktick is 1 2 steps away of being the ultimate app for daily task habit management tool
__label__2 everything is under pro version
__label__2 it worked for the first week now i can't add a task without it crashing
__label__1 no use
__label__2 app works pretty well but if they want me to list out all events and plans in my life their privacy policy needs to get stronger and be better defined we collect your data here's a vague description of what we keep it as long as we've decided we need to and we won't tell you how long that is we also completely change this policy in a way that we're break the policy you may have originally agreed to but it's your responsibility as the user to make sure we don't break our end of the deal don't like this delete the app basically the privacy policy not exactly trust encouraging fix this in a privacy friendly way and i'll change my review
__label__3 i don't understand why the changes i make in this app don't sync with google calendar what am i missing
__label__3 only 24hr option no 12 would be cool if you could color code the circles in the calendar date to that calendar that has an event for that day
__label__1 does not integrate well across multiple cross platform devices more upsetting to discover this after paying for the app
__label__1 hi app states its free yet there is a charge after 7 days dont mislead people
__label__3 there is no way to edit repetetiveness through ui unless i know the smart commands
__label__3 looks cool but i do not find it actually helpful unless you write down everything you do every hour every day
__label__4 great app would be nice to be able to check the checklist items in todos
__label__2 great app but waaay to complicated deleted it and replaced with a different simpler app interface looks cool though
__label__2 after an update started showing really annoying full screen ads been using it for quite some time will uninstall
__label__4 make more advanced settings for paid subscription not the color of the theme
__label__2 the new update is awful i have to do so many extra clicks to perform basic operations like moving tasks to different days multi select doesn't work any more and the widget is totally broken rescheduling anything from the widget locks it up completely
__label__3 is the feature of different colours for different tasks available for the free version too i m actually not able to set it that way no sir i did the way u told me to do it is still not showing different colours
__label__1 the tutorial doesn't help and shows you nothing the app is very bad and isn't easy to understand i have given up after wasting time trying to figure this trash out i wouldn't recommend this to anyone
__label__4 great app but would be good if you could edit tasks after you've written them also would be good if it could have a daily 'things to do list'on calendar which could be ticked off alongside projects tasks
__label__5 really good app helps you focus
__label__1 can't even name my tasks
__label__5 honest great app to get you to do the things you wanna get done
__label__3 the concept is good but why the app is not notifying me about thr task even though i have turned the notification on this is very bad
__label__4 for those coming from wunderlist to transfer your data log on to a computer not a phone or tablet to transfer your data if you're having transfer trouble seems similar to the glory that was wunderlist but still not as good
__label__2 great idea but the appl has serious issues syncing so completely unusable migrated from wunderlist but i guess i'll stick with it because they fubar ed this to do app go figure microsoft still love the my day feature a shame
__label__5 great app if you want to get rid of bad habits or reinforce good ones the free version of it is not as restrictive as most free versions of apps so that is a big plus i honestly never really wrote a review on playstore before but this app legitimately helped me overcome a few of my most detrimental bad habits to the people that made the app thank you for taking the time to make an amazing app i hope that everyone has a wonderful day
__label__1 remainder app for free that s what i thought this app was please don t waste our time it is very disrespectful for you to get people you say it s for free the app and it s not for free please don t do that its not nice to delete apps because you say lies lies are not good and if you play with my trust and the world trust you are not helping the world to be a better place you are helping to continue destroy i don't want to open no more apps i don t trust what they say
__label__3 the app is good but the customer support is awful i tried them a few times asking to transfer my premium account i had on iphone to my samsung phone but got no reply whatsoever
__label__2 have used app for about 4 months now i can't get back into it keeps asking to sign in or create account won't let me do either time to dump it
__label__3 needed a standalone platform which does not connect to any of my calendars
__label__1 way to confusing to do something simple
__label__3 if you want something that syncs to your calendar you are in luck it really is beautiful and such a wonderful idea however my 3 star review comes from the fact you can't use it without syncing to your calendar and there by having it affect your calendar i was hoping to use this as an hourly time management tool much like a block system but i can't have it be that and have my calendar be a place for just appointments it makes the actual calendar look too full and messy basically in short can you please add an offline tool as well
__label__4 this is the best task keeping app out on the market it has a very easy interface and many useful features that are blended together well into a useful product
__label__4 i'm loving it so far it is clean user friendly and v simple to use not too much drama that i have to sort out i don't need background landscape pictures for example and i don't need graphs and charts to rate my productivity i just need to get stuff done thanks guys
__label__4 it's amazing
__label__3 i like this app and have been using it for a while but have started noticing appointments i put in the calendar don't sync to google and some how disappear out of my calendar so i have no idea when they are extremely frustrating since i don't always notice the appointment has disappeared
__label__4 great app i am using it for a while functionality wise it the best in the market it can get updated in terms of visuals and performance
__label__3 i don't understand why all the tags disappear once you start pay or join the trial the only tag showing is priority before i joined premium there were other options which disappeared
__label__1 another simple app with a subscription plan this is not the right strategy to attract more people this kind of app should be a one time payment no more whatever the number of apps with this strategy it doesn't make it a good one
__label__2 uninstalled when i saw the app wanted me to pay a subscription fee as ransom for my data i never will
__label__5 it has a really useful ability to add sub tasks to other sub tasks great to use for ordering tasks
__label__3 nice app
__label__3 it seems like it could be good but very disappointed that it's subscription based and that there's not a one time purchase option not sure if pro has this option but it also doesnt seem to have a history of completed tasks will need to keep looking
__label__3 nice app the only challenge have seen is that sometimes the notifcation alarm does not work
__label__5 very useful app colourful too
__label__2 it was pretty good on my old phone then when everything was ported to my new one the app came but not the lists i'd made what's the point of that i've deleted it
__label__3 the program is really awesome but i'm using the oppo f7 and it doesn't do any notification i followed a guide but it didn't help that's the programs only problem
__label__4 new user and i'm impressed a lot of neat features i've been looking for in apps like this it's obvious dev is active and listening and thats a great sign if i have an immediate suggestion it'd be for us to be able to add tab categories of traits besides the default characteristics skills for example to add things like personality lifestyle or however we want to organize our skillset categories so those 2 sections aren't cluttered a search option for icons too maybe keep it up
__label__5 i love this app somedays i just want to be lazy and do nothing but this app helps me stay on top of my game i use it dor monthly goals and everyday todo lists another good thing about this app is that you can set tiners for each thing to be completed definitly a 10 out of 10 app
__label__1 terrible app it didn't let me put my whole schedule in and it insisted me to buy the premium version which i'm not going to do 4 99 for an app that doesn't even work that well no thanks bye and it restarted my whole damn thing like wth bch
__label__4 helpful to keep track of to do's and can set reminders at various times
__label__1 the english used is very poor thus if the developed cannot master simple rules of grammar why should i trust them with such sensitive subject matter uninstalled
__label__1 please free the colour theme and tags and then i will give 5 stars
__label__5 really amazing and helped me sooo much just i hope that it can be sharable by more than one person for group planning one line and it will be world organizer or making groups thanx for developers
__label__4 i love this app i have always been a franklin covey planner gal and this is similar to the paper planner great search function
__label__2 super super buggy on my note 8 can't press anything on the character creation menu after registering justin the tip guy always comes up after pressing any of the menus super super annoying please fix a s a p
__label__3 would be better if it could hide declined events
__label__2 i like the options available but for some reason i can still go into other apps when i am planting only after i go back into the app does it give me the notification could i get some help
__label__1 need to make more convinient i just set 3 time alarm for the task but it didnt work
__label__3 no feedback and i want to arrange the tasks according to their priorities in the home screen widget and i want to repeat some tasks weekly
__label__1 won't even let me make a new account unusable
__label__2 i'm so confused and frustrated trying to figure this app out
__label__5 easy to use for quick list with reminders for daily or last minute reminders
__label__1 very good app that is perfect for how i think but it kept asking me to rate the app for months now and i've always pushed later i'm sick of it asking me to rate the app
__label__3 hard to use
__label__4 would be perfect if you could update cloned activities meaning if you changed one all of them would change too you could check off the activities like a to do list it works as a reward system you could scroll up in your timetable to see what you did that day things you missed because it only shows everything from that point in time forwards otherwise really love the design and layout and it makes me super organised
__label__2 new great concept but not for confidential data because it's not encrypted nor pw protected on phone or pc and one day any do company will get hacked all your stuff be be out there like equifax resolved app loses your work eg i created a new task started a notes section pasted it in some material and clicked save then i went to another app to get more material but when i returned to any do my notes were gone your save button is fraudulent if it does not save when clicked
__label__3 hello developers can you please help i put a passcode on the app and now it won't let me access the calender it keeps telling me that my passcode is incorrect when i know i put it in correctly please fix this
__label__1 used to be good now massive full screen adds with sound first time they ran without warning very embarrassing will give it a week to revise then will uninstall adds are ok but the full screen nature with sound isn't
__label__2 loading takes too long and reminders don't work
__label__3 the android app is pretty good but the web app is lacking i need both for a work flow that works for me things like clear colour coding on projects across all platforms is needed maybe this exists but i couldn't easily find it
__label__4 just installed this app it is easy to use and is quite beautiful i would love to have a vision board feature page that i can put pics and maybe a daily quote feature spiritual before jumping to premium please
__label__5 really cool app
__label__2 a little too confusing
__label__1 recurrent tasks don't work
__label__2 awesome tracker yet it seems overpriced in my country way more more than the typical range of 5 its about 10 for me with tax included also i don't appreciate the greyed out price being the same as the 33 claimed discounted price very deceiving lastly the lack of support for a fingerprint access method is subpart for 2019
__label__3 please fix the date format we're not all backward americans
__label__5 good app
"__label__3 okay thing is this app is almost gender biased the starting avatar it 
gave is already set in female and you'll have to earn something to get 
beard and mustache i thought it will be custom task set ups but it's 
already given lags a bit too"
__label__4 excellent overall very flexible with many useful features only suggestion i'd make for improvement is a feature that as the user if they really intend to complete a task that has been snoozed multiple times
__label__3 rather new to the app to rate it higher than a 3 at this time but i like the results it is helping me to achieve i expect improved time management as i get the app's feature set up to serve me best i sense i may rate it higher as i experience it benefits more i do like using it better then wunderlist
"__label__2 was excited for this app but the fact i can't change the notification 
alarm is a deal breaker"
__label__5 it is very useful and helps my day yield more
__label__2 so far the app is great would get 5 stars if it had a tabbing feature where you can side over to each task name instead of having to go to the menu button to switch
__label__3 new version of time tune is difficult to use please upgrade it
__label__1 so i forced myself to sit thu the first exercise and i want my 25 minutes back please is this a joke the devs must be sadomasochistic to develop an app that flashes conflicting phrases such as stay focused you can do it with don't look at me stop phubbing l had to look that one up put down the phone not that i was using a phone in the first place quite extraordinary
__label__2 i was going to give 4 stars but the app does something kinda sleazy where it asks you what you would rate it and only redirects you to google play if you said five stars so i lowered it to 2 stars
__label__3 it was ok
__label__4 it's a good app i like the encouraging reminders and memes each day i wish there were just a couple more openings for tracking but overall it's good it doesn't eat my battery like the last one i tried in fact i'm readjusting to use in the coming year
__label__1 has less features than wunderlist a more complicated ux and is tied to a microsoft account enjoy the crappy spyware folks
__label__3 still working on use
__label__3 when i goto monthly view press the date the event is on the previous date shows up sometimes i am able to scroll forward to the date i am looking for but mostly not for example i scroll april 24th and april 23rd shows up i like the design of the app would like to see yearly view i also can't see events i posted unless i rotate the phone but it works for tasks and notes tabs fine
__label__2 i work in a school and the schedule has times like 4 42 which this app doesnt do like it but absolutely useless to me
__label__3 awesome until i was trying this app out to see if it was possible to finally break ties with my paper calendar this app had some features that made it better than google calendars that is until you had to watch an ad to schedule an appointment now when i save an appointment have to sit through a full page ad i didn't get enough time in the app to figure out if it was worth it to pay for the full version but now the mandatory ads are a deal breaker
__label__3 incredibly useful service and thanks so much for creating it the app tends to be buggy but nothing that couldn't easily be worked around until the last update since the last update drag and drop sorting of to do and i suspect dailies as well subtasks checklists no longer works which is really frustrating at least the website works great as always it's just frustrating to have to run down to the computer to fix my lists
__label__2 please make it available as a widget
__label__2 only rated 2 stars because of the ability to sync with the calendar apps on the phone and the ability to cross out any tasks once finished however the app is fairly simple with tasks laid out like a shopping or to do list with the inability to edit the timings of tasks i had set an appointment for 1 30 but the app had automatically set it for 10 00 am and not allowing me to edit it also it would have been nice for the tasks to be laid out in calendar format with color coding options
__label__5 this application is the best for to do task i think it is more than you expect it will fulfill your all requirements it has most creative function that you haven't imagine thank you so much developers
__label__3 so far it's not flexible enough for me also there needs to be an option to remove 'general discussion ' from the dash board there seems to be a startling number of people with goals surrounding masturbation and porn and i just don't need to see that when i'm trying to inspire myself to play more music i'm going with the stars as a benefit of the doubt as i haven't given it much time but i can't see me using this
__label__3 routine maker is amazing but notifications are not coming when the phone is in lock mode so i uninstalled it
__label__5 beautiful graph calendar i love how beautiful and practical this is i love it
__label__4 i really like the app it's pretty cool how do i get the 24 hr clock on my android wear 5 stars if the 24hr face can is possible on the watch
__label__1 cool visual but doesn't work the way i thought it would i don't like organizing my hour by hour tasks through my calendar because it clutters it up and makes me miss my important events i wanted to use this app thinking that it would allow me to plan my dialy tasks just through the app but every time i want to plan an event it forces me to do it through my calendar which i don't like good concept but i don't see a reason to use it since it just wants me to use my calendar anyway
__label__5 i like this app
__label__3 does exactly one thing tracks habits but does it well and without pointless bloaty extras or ads clean interface sadly app seems to have been abandoned by developers and premium features like sync no longer work no way to transfer data
__label__4 i really liked this app however i have downloaded it yesterday and created tasks which repeats daily but it always shows tasks date 30 march it was just the date i created it it repeats daily so the dates should change too it feels as if i am checking undone tasks from the past even in the calander view these tasks are not added to 31 march it's annoying me please do something about it
__label__4 nice app but not able to use widget nokia 2 1 android pie
__label__3 used it in the past and wasn't too happy with it tried it again and now i have no idea why i didn't like it before i especially love the integration of the to do task list within the app i use the agenda view on the widget and couldn't be more pleased as the title says i love it several years later and still living it wouldn't think of changing it for anything rating dropped from 5 to 3 stars too many features removed with recent updates
__label__1 when i first downloaded the app it worked seamlessly but once i upgraded to the pro version it began to lag and slow down i can't access my timeline store or achievements anymore and it's slow run time is making the app so tedious to use it's becoming an awful app for me
__label__2 doesn't sync reliably and that's one of the most critical features for a calendar app
__label__1 i wanted to like it iinitially it looked great but it has such a limited window of time view it's no good for planning a few hours view and that's it scrolling hour by hour day by day useless its sole function appears to be to tell you what you've got coming up in the next few hours which frankly is not much use to anyone as far as i can see cloud cal uses similar circles with a view of the whole month which would be great but sadly the pro version doesn't work so no go there either
__label__5 works beyond my expectations
__label__4 smooth and simple ui devs could make setting an alarm for tasks even simpler with less taps since i use reminders at specific times for each task
__label__4 perfect except for one thing the 'i want to ' button at the bottom of my to do list sometimes blocks the bottom item on my list making it more difficult to cross off there is already an add item button on each list category so i think it should be removed or users should be given an option to remove it
__label__3 not great why can't you put the total number of days completed regardless of streak
__label__2 i liked the app and i purchased it but i can't sync any data from old phone and when logged out of the app there is no way to login again except reinstall the app so if anyone is fine with restart all the progress everytime you change phone this app is for you but since i like to keep my progress to the new phone i am stop using this app and find another one
__label__3 this app has a lot of potential but a few things could be added and tweaked i recommend adding a calender and more icon options
__label__1 this is a really smart way to keep you off your phone and motivated to work and i would love to use this app all day everyday but it needs a pause button desperately life is full of things that pop up out the blue and in its current state you loose all progress or get rewarded for doing nothing please please please add an optional pause button there are already a bunch of optional thing to tweak it please add this i would go pro in a heart beat and it would become my top app
__label__2 do not pay for upgrade if you upgrade it just messes the app up i have to manually change days every morning now if it weren't for that it'd be great please fix
__label__2 password reset is broken cannot transfer it to a new cell phone think twice before buying this app the habit related side is good however this is why i bought it
__label__4 great app easily share lists with others easy to add or check off items one enhancement request would be to make another default view option the list of all projects rather than having to choose one project to default view
__label__3 has good features although takes a very long time to figure out how the lists work
__label__4 todoist is really useful if you have a variety of tasks that you need to carry out but don't want to write it down on pen and paper
__label__4 i wish to buy the pro version and also encourage my friends and family to do the same but hope you can make some improvements to the app the ui looks very minimal which is a vanilla android template for an app development please make the ui a bit more appealing we would have also like to do routines that are repeated in intervals of more than 15 days present app doesn't allow me to set a monthly routine hope the icons can be more rich and appealing
__label__5 you receive satisfying rewards for staying off your phone building positive reinforcement for off screen time it has an adjustable time scale which corresponds to the reward you receive so it can be as convinient as you desire i love it it has really helped me so much with getting past hard work deadlines and just focusing on certain tasks in general 11 6 much recommended
__label__1 it keeps lagging and dificult to select the traits i want for my character ugh not worth it uninstall
__label__5 very nice app it helps me be more productive
__label__4 unmatched
__label__3 i love using forest as a timer when i study however there is the ethical issue that you can't plant real trees unless you have premium this really frustrates me because they took an opportunity to help the environment and turned it into an opportunity to make money i understand that they need the money from buying premium to plant the trees but it feels like they are making people feel guilty in order to sell premium to them thank you for the response i appreciate you taking the time
__label__1 app is completely broken can't even make an avatar none of the options show up also get an error message when trying to show a display name
"__label__2 this app sucks its slow and they make you pay to make checklists which is 
ridiculous"
__label__3 please also add the option to import few activities from any day instead of the whole day onto timeline of a routine further please add the feature of allowing a to start a routine custom routine using time interval instead of defining exact time because on some bad days due to unavoidable circumstances we are out of schedule and adding a fresh custom timetable for the day hurts a lot modifying timings for every activity for rest of its features it worth 5
__label__3 please make the widgets more customizable and make us able to change the background transparency edit looks like you didn't understand i'm talking about the background transparency of the widgets again if you didn't understand i'm talking about the ability to change the background transparency the blackish background which makes the contrast higher and isn't necessary on wallpapers which aren't too bright
__label__3 i wish it would sync so i could use it on all devices
__label__3 why doesn't this to do list app work with natural language in most others you can write 'at 12pm do x and y ' and you'll get a task added automatically
__label__5 really fun i'm new so far curious if there are bages awarded ect
__label__2 it's alright but like then it gets annoying bc you can't set the timer and if you need to check smt on internet it won't let you
__label__5 perfect to do app wish it integrated with chrome though would be nice to have it on my desktop
__label__5 amazing not only is this app cute to boot but it's so easy to use it doesn't largely focus on the character aspect which i like because i'm mostly here to organize my life everything is covered to do lists dailies scheduling its so extremely customizable and in such a simple platform that i dont have to pay extra for not only that there is the community aspect its about holding yourself accountable and this app is perfect thank you
__label__5 very simple interface definitely helps me be more productive with my time
__label__3 app is good but have some error it's no refresh automatically on widget home screen we have to open app to refresh apps hour line please fix tht error
__label__5 hi how can get premium
__label__1 wastage of time
"__label__1 i wanted a calendar app to keep track of business appointments separate 
from my personal appointments however this app automatically synced with 
my other calendar combining all appointments i have reached out to them 
for assistance but recieved no help very disappointed"
__label__5 amazing i love how it has a game element to it when i use it to keep me focused and of my phone it is a real help and i get all my school work done on time i can also get excited when i have enough coins to buy a new plant i am saving up for the dog one if anyone is in need of something to get them of their phone so they can concentrate on school i'd reccomend this app from amber
__label__3 there is no option for repeated activities is a few hours i will give 5 star and uninstall todoist if i can set 'every hour every 3 hour' so far this app is better than todoist
__label__3 the website is buggy but enjoyable the app however feel almost nonfunctional
__label__5 the best widget you can swap lists without ever leaving your home screen and they're all color coded yay i like that you can use it simple way or a complicated way depending on what you need but the complexity never gets in the way of the simple use thank you for this app
__label__4 best watch once you understand it it takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually get it but once you do it does exactly what it promises its sleek yet informative and by far the best at a glance app for your homescreen the watch addon is the cherry on the cake only improvement in my opinion would be to add multiple different widgets like give me the option for a small simple one on my home screen and a bigger more detailed one on my office screen for instance
__label__2 can't check of checklist items
__label__1 can't do anything unless you buy the pro version
__label__1 subscription based model for better features happy to pay 20 once off if i really like an app but not ongoing costs that can change any time
__label__3 nice app but i can not add any winget to my mobile screen
__label__4 this is the app which i use for almost a year there is one issue i have faced recently namely some tasks and events do not synchronize on multiple devices where i installed the app i'm using this app on my android smartphone as well as on ipad i would be very pleased if you fix it
__label__5 love this app really wanted something to block plan my day it is flexible you can make your own tags and events are automatically imported from calendar
__label__3 custom swipe options hidden in premium
__label__2 didn't get past not being able to use it in portrait mode i think i should be able to choose whether i need widespread view as in a spreadsheet or a portrait view to view a page of writing and this does not give me the option i may end up using it this is only the second app that i have tried for organizing by used to be hand ink written notebooks
__label__1 it does not seem possible to have a simple shopping list shared with another person nice app but useless
__label__3 its ok notifications dont work very often
__label__4 so far the best habit tracking app i've tried the only one i was able to actually stick to using if only full version would be more avaliable
__label__2 i would love this app only if the notifications work at all there were no alarms or notifications or pop ups showing in my oppo f5 i tried tinkering with the system like what was said in the troubleshooting page so may times yet nothing worked would give 5 if i do not have this issue
__label__5 really very very great useful and highly customised app above all it's free and developed by the world leader in customisation developer is so helpful to provide individual attention happy to have this great app
__label__3 showed promise but let down by an incredibly stupid copy function
__label__2 otherwise the app is good but i bought the full version and did i exepet to get customization fratures atleast give to feature to mark different sectors with different colours very disappointed you guys should consider making the user interface less complicated
__label__2 the app works great with wifi i love the feel of the app and desktop versions but a decent chunk of my day is spent with limited no wifi i can't recommend it for that
__label__1 online really register really there's two other apps in the suggested similar apps banner that are better than this they're free to use with out registration why for this type of app full offline again
__label__1 at the features are premium
__label__4 pretty good
__label__3 please make an google account login tired of microsoft auth shenanigans
__label__3 not sure yet still testing it
__label__4 love this app didn't think i could find something as good as wunderlist but this app is better just a couple of things would make it perfect option to change font size and option to add new items to top of list
__label__3 the app is laggy also it has a premium version so many important features you will have to buy i feel that the organisation of the can be more better today and tomorrow should be completely seperate and there also should be a slot of yesterday where you can see what you missed doing the day before
__label__3 the app idea is great on itself however there are too many options blocked behind the pro version which one would think are basic whitelist and exporting the progress changing phones makes all the progress be lost moreover although not essential some free achievements would also be nice even if they don't give any coins i'm willing to change my rating if i see any of those changes since like i said the app is quite good already free version feels like less than a free trial
__label__5 intelligent intuitive design this is how i would have designed one for myself
__label__1 updated and the only thing new is ads deleting after years of use over multiple phones
__label__1 could not get the app to save event time properly all i wanted was to put a due date between 11 50 p m and 11 59 p m on a certain day would not do it the app kept automatically changing my times that's annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on
__label__3 excellence app but now widget error on asus zenfone max 3
__label__2 it keeps bugging out whenever i try to do anything it wont stop doing ghe tutorial and wont ket me delete tast and stuff
__label__3 i wanted to play with it for a few minutes before putting in my payment info i realize i can cancel but would prefer to do a quick test first i
__label__3 great concept store doesn't open though it needs fixing
__label__2 it was okay but when i tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show that is extremely inconvenient and annoying i tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didn't work would have given five stars if it wasn't for this issue
__label__5 ok i've finally found something to replace my beloved cloudcal and cloudtasks which seem to have been abandoned as the dev is communicating nothing to customers ticktick has a similar not that steep learning curve but once you catch on it is fast flexible efficient and gorgeous i run the dark mode which is actively updated my new go to task manager and calendar great job devs
__label__4 we had some syncing issues with our shared lists that came in from wunderlist but once we had them syncing things have worked great
__label__3 good
__label__3 cant get demo to play its probably a great app
__label__3 so far it's a nice simple app that makes it easy to organise tasks i am a fan if the widget to let me see different lists but when i switch lists it often unchecks what has already been done which kind of defeats the purpose if this could be fixed i would increase the rating
__label__5 this app is amazing it helps me stay focused on my tasks and definitely away from my phone love it and highly recommend
__label__4 i really like the app but i don't know if i'm using it to its fullest potential has any on made a tutorial
__label__4 great app
__label__4 this is a great app the ability to track my habits and edit them as needed is really awesome there are just 2 things i'd really like to see that would make this a 5 star review for me 1 full editing options currently can't edit the frequency for my times per period items and 2 a help glossary feature i'm not sure exactly what the link icon means as it is 0 on items i've not done or done once but 1 on items that i've done twice or three times
__label__1 bruh i literally have no clue how this app works
__label__1 sync not working don't buy in app purchase
__label__1 i should be able to use the app when offline and the app should sync the changes whenever connected to the internet it shouldn't force me to connect with the internet for ticking a checkbox
__label__3 initially the app worked really well but now it is not opening and i dnt know what to do i also tried clearing the data bt the issue still remains
__label__3 poor completed tasks stay within the list dotted all around today shows items due tomorrow before thise due today tasks dragged from one list to another stay in original list not very useful i'm looking for an alternative
__label__5 great app i use it to keep track of work projects and my tasks for courses i take for my masters the free version is perfect enough for what i use it for
__label__5 amazing app beats the even best ones out there good work keep it up keep improving
__label__3 i just downloaded installed this app i was in search of an app that allows me to insert date and time stamp preferably using a button on the screen this way i can time stamp different sections in my notes and activities however i didn't find that feature would love to see that in this app as it needs quite a few of my requirements
__label__3 i love the idea of it but currently it's far too complicated for me to use i'd love it very much if all the setting rewards and gained skills was a little easier to do
__label__5 perfect i'm loving every element so far i love that i can at some point once it's all done use it like my paper planner and sync them with my phone i hate carrying my paper planner and also having to update my cell calendar i love and cant wait to see and use all the coming soons i'm so excited i'm hoping also a widget will be something to come soon as well so that i can have it open on my phone and not always have to open the app for quick reference keep it up
__label__1 blank screens when initially launching character creation screen missing most assets but still semi functional unable to begin oneplus 6t a10
__label__3 love this app but after not using it for a couple of months everything has disappeared anyone able to help thanks for the advice just done that waiting now for their feedback as said i live this app
__label__1 i bought the premium version and it will not sync i have snet numerous requests to support and have received no responses
__label__3 good enough for a to do list app a few additional features would make it even better though option to re arrange list rename edit an existing item add a note or comment on an item sync interval to save battery life
__label__2 i love that you can chose x amount of days a week to complete a habit other apps force you to commit to specific days the flexibility in this app helps me succeed what i hate about this app is it fails to get my habit completion for example i did my workout for the day but still receive repeated notices to do said workout for that day way to drain any joy out of an accomplishment habitbull
__label__3 perfect to temporarily forget my phone
__label__1 always freezing
__label__3 the widget is not updating automatically
__label__5 as a gamer this makes life fun you can make a long of lists of your daily life and gain xp and rewards you can hatch pets feed them ride mounts find a party to run with get cool gear and go on quests i can see where fun wise there could possibly in the future be expansions for more to come by all means but right now this really helps to keep on track and makes it so i actually enjoy some part of my life for the first time in a long time outside of my pets
__label__4 very good could have a little more utilities for the free version
__label__5 to me it is by far the best time planner for a daily schedule
__label__3 the app looked very promising but there were too many upgrade to premium notifications when initially clicking through the app from what i saw i probably would have paid for a year if i was able to try out the fill app first instead i got what felt like being kicked in the face by upgrade notifications for these reasons 3 stars and lost buisness
__label__2 not a fan of the new foundations update you promised so many new features and didn't deliver any of them the update to subtasks didn't fix some of the core issues with them
__label__3 app was great but now i cant set my work end times only starting due to it being restricted for premium only now after the new update bad timing guys uninstalling app
__label__3 the user interfaceis not good enough it is not that much understandable
__label__2 keeps me on top of things
__label__1 way to confusing to do something simple
__label__3 ok app
__label__2 eh it's mediocre and really doesn't do anything your calendar app on your phone doesn't already do i liked using the month widget until it just decided on jan 29 that the month of february no loger existed i tried to look ahead to the month of feb to see a preview from the widget but it kept going fron jan to march the only way to view feb in the widget was to change the date to feb in my phone just went back to my phone's calendar app uninstalling
__label__3 3 of 5 stars that's all
__label__2 great app but i constantly have sync issue and that's why i started to use todoist
__label__5 the app is great and i honestly love it until recently now when i want to plant a tree the app stops unless i'm connected to the internet also when i successfully plant a tree while using the app offline the tree doesn't save and the app stops please fix this as soon as possible and i will rate this 5 stars edit wow after the new update the app doesn't stop but you can't plant a tree online nor offline congrats edit it's fixed
__label__2 i regret buying the premium version a lot of money for only a minor update i wish i could get a refund do not buy the premium version from the app it doesn't worth your money
__label__1 how to use this help me please
__label__3 i don't get any notification on the tasks to be done neither do alarm work and so i am get frustrated pls do help me with this apart from that it is a good habit tracking app
__label__1 bad experience with the subscription they refuse to give back the months i haven't used after canceling just want the yearly subscription the mac app crashes gets stuck
__label__3 love this app i used to give it 5 stars but its so sliggish on the s8 and half the time the widget wont load
__label__2 useful as a to do list sets a real annoying plan your day popup reminder every morning how you disable it is non obvious uninstalled
__label__3 wish i am not able to edit anything in past for future events if i am crrating any habbit same day onwards i still can able to edit in past events
__label__3 i don't know why but it doesn't open i click on it then i wait and at the end it notifies that the app has stopped
__label__1 have been using wunderlist for years and it works perfectly well forget this your app rename wunderlist and continue with it simple
__label__4 the free option has all the features i need an alarm would be nice but since i don't have the premium i'll do without for now
__label__2 c'mon to have more than 10 lists i've to pay nope that's not gonna happen
__label__3 8 4 18 i'd give five stars if the weather showes in celsius other than that the app is absolutely great i ended up getting the paid version because i felt like the developers deserved it for making such a versatile scheduling tool 20 1 2020 the degree still does not change to c even if i change it on darksky fixing this would be very helpful especially that this has been noted almost 2 years ago
__label__3 repeating previous posts don't bother with the free version if you cannot pay the premium it's just a shell not worth the space it requires
__label__4 overall a good app but i would also like the option of switching from landscape view
__label__3 whitelist apps feature should be available without buying pro in todays world we necessarily need some apps while studying or working the app would be useless if we can't use those apps so i request you to make available whitelist apps feature to the non pro version i would have given 5 stars if the feature was available for non pro users
__label__5 wish you could enter info data in past i was trying to move from one app to another i had to take screenshots great app though especially reminder alarm update i can set past start date thank you
__label__5 best todo list organizational application i have found i have tried many different apps like this one before finding ticktick it's proven extremely useful for organizing my day to day tasks and chores
__label__5 nice
__label__3 beautiful
__label__3 loved it except that it wouldn't save and show me all of my events
__label__3 still trying figure it out
__label__5 so much fun to use and makes me feel better about doing everything i need to
__label__3 really like this app but wish i could see my whole calendar or at least have the option to search for a specific date that would make it perfect as i want to use it as my go to planner
__label__2 make a go back button
__label__3 confusing without a lot of explanation on what is what might be good when i figure it out but it's not a real intuitive app and has a figure it out curve
__label__2 came back to this after not using it for a while tonnes of updates has made it rubbish
__label__2 widget is not working completely it does not sync with the app plz solve this problem
"__label__3 it's great though you only get 100 habits in premium why not unlimited 
not a fan of a glass ceiling model whats more you cant remove this cap"
__label__3 lower rating until i use it more just started
__label__5 i love the concept i've always saw the parallel between reallife and an rrg in terms of skill growth and education
__label__5 this is really helping me manage my time and daily activities wonderful app
__label__4 this application which i used thoroughly and this application seriously deserves 5 stars i have given 4 stars because it don't have multiple user merged account in it which helps our 4 members of family to write their to do in a single place
__label__2 does this app truly have reminders it refused to remind me of my event
__label__2 i love ticktick and have returned after trying a few other task apps the problem is that it's all a it buggy emails sent to be added as tasks dissappear if sent automatically through gmail and my online web based tasks are different to those on the app maybe time to look again at other apps ticktick who should i email i'm also totally fed up as it no longer works with google assistant
__label__4 please add two factor authentication i couldn't post my request through app because i don't have a facebook account to log in
__label__3 it serves its purpose i have not used too many others to compare i wish i could set different reminder sounds i hate the ads after adding an appointment sometimes i have 2 things to add and have to wait which is not ok when coordinating with a doctor's office
__label__4 good app overall but still doesn't recognise the date of reminder from plain text this needs to improve
__label__3 good
__label__1 does not log in after 5 minites it's still trying to log itself in
__label__4 its really useful i really wish it had a way to add people so you could submit tasks for eachother or a way to access it on a computer or browser
__label__5 it's been helpful and very cute
__label__1 you can't even try it out they are automatically asking you to pick a subscriber plan before you can even see a calendar or anything
__label__1 why can't i buy stuff from the store and see the adds this is very annoying it is a good app but im not able to access so many features of this app it shows some error so just fix this
__label__4 3 5 cool idea but way too many adds opposite of making someone focus edit 4 5 5 after purchasing pro v pretty good i wish there was a way to adjust the time goal to be something else other than 25 min or instead of trees being different at 60 min 1 5 hrs etc some trees shld be diff at 40 min 50 min etc
__label__1 requires my email no thanks
__label__5 this is actually fun i get excited everytime i complete a task
__label__3 why cant i logged in _
__label__3 needs a setting to repeat the task
__label__3 great app for arranging schedules and activities easy tool to teach u good productivity
__label__4 great app and service the user base is amazing and the staff is awesome no notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks can't read the full text of challenge tasks before joining the health experience widget doesn't display any information
__label__4 it's a very good app just that sometimes it doesn't open like it's frozen i then have to go force it to stop then try again to open it
__label__4 fun and productive
__label__3 i like the app on how it organize your tasks you can customize how you will be reminded and prioritized unfortunately the alarm doesn't work it either late or not working at all i thought if i pay premium it will fix but it didn't so 3 5
__label__5 wow
__label__5 update thank you for the info it does what i want i have been using this app for about a month i was excited to see i can separate my to do list into today tomorrow someday etc as this feature i use to prioritise tasks which is what i really wanted from the app unfortunately it keeps moving all the tasks back into today which makes it kind of pointless to separate them in the first place please fix this or i'm on the hunt for another to do list organizer
__label__2 i love the idea of this app unfortunately it is not super user friendly i've been using it for over a month and it is not very obvious how to complete quests or anything else and yes i have gone through the faqs i finally figured out how to hatch eggs but that's all it's a pretty clunky app as a game but it does a pretty good job of keeping me accountable for things that's the only reason i haven't deleted it as a gamify your life app i'm not convinced hopefully it improves
__label__5 student
__label__3 i'm editing my review due to the new update dear todoist the new update made it nontrivial to change the project of a task on the app i have to click on the three dots then on move project this should be as simple as changing the label please be so kind to the users and fix this great app does exactly what i need it to do extremely simplistic and elegant yet functional design i would tweak one little thing or too but overall todoist is almost a perfect product
__label__3 seems nice i wish there was a way to just do notes and not only tasks also which there was a way to lock certain notes that may be private in case your phone is lost
__label__5 i love the fact it covers different and very specific areas i need for my productivity a daily task schedule with sub tasks a calender to plan my roadmap project lists for my work and to collaborate with my team even assign tasks to them and just recently the new daily log in the habits is really helping me form new habits i love the fact that most of the important features are free it makes it easier to work with my team without them using premium like i do and they learn it easily
__label__1 this app used to be great now it is garbage a few months ago it started doubling a few tasks no problem i just delete the extras now i get 5 to 10 copies of every task i delete it is worthless i can't forget the wait times to open the app up to 8 minutes of staring at a black screen oh and the fact that in the past week or two it started giving me ads even though i have been using the paid version for years already i let them know a couple weeks ago and got no response
__label__5 this is the best app i've ever used to boost my productivity and keep a good record of my completed and incomplete tasks i'm just a little sad that it's only compatible with android at the moment could you please make it compatible with ios too it'd be super helpful if you could
__label__3 jus started using so far i like it
__label__3 this app is really good but i have a major issue with it it helps you focus not to get distracted but sometimes i need to a calculator or google or a dictionary i can't because my tree will die so i need to exit the app the tree is still growing and then i can access google or what not please let the app access certain apps if possible
__label__3 i really loved the app but after using it once it does not launch and keeps crashing i have tried reinstalling but it only works the first time i open it then later i can't open it keeps crashing i use a samsung m30 if that helps
__label__5 as a teenager it is very crucial to manage time habits and tasks this is one app which allowed me to do so my saying for this app is that it would control what you do in a day by its limit
__label__1 this app has some major problems it seemed to work fine for the first day of running after the first day no reminders were executed any game armor or weapons could never be equipped it appeared you could equip them but once you left the screen they become unequipped and they never showed up on the avatar i mainly got this app for productivity and since the reminders do not work i'm not certain i'm going to continue using it unless these problems are fixed
__label__2 worked well for a few days and then just stopped sending reminders the reminders would pop up if i opened the app myself but that's obviously not the point of a reminder also froze a lot pretty much useless when it worked it was excellent
__label__5 the developers got back to me within minutes and helped me sort the problem out within a very short period thank you support widget was being blocked by battery optimizer previous review paid for premium however the feature to mark complete on the widget is not working will do 5 star if this can be resolved
__label__2 uninstalled after latest update and it blocked all my lists until i set up an account no thanks
__label__3 timeline keeps ignoring certain tasks and hardly ever actually notifies me good if i'm keeping an eye on it
__label__5 tick tick has been very easy to use and very handy i use it for both business and personal use and find it very easy to collaborate lists with other people and create lists
__label__1 free version only allows 9 lists lame
__label__2 i used to like this app been using it for a few years with tolerably okay results but it's been having too many problems with sync and with failing to load karma data not only that but if you miss checking a box but don't see that omission until the next day there's nothing you can do about it maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good i'd like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my android but apparently that can't be done and if i delete my online account i delete everything i think i just want to dump this flawed app and see if i can find a good app that does everything offline in one device with no registration required
__label__5 this is a very well designed app i especially love the ability to share lists with my wife and make comments back on forth on specific tasks
__label__4 good app easy to use i like the fact that it emails my daily to do list
__label__4 the app is good i am using the pro version since years it works well with google calendar now i want to use my outlook calendar as well but i can not find the possibility to add an outlook calendar there do you have any suggestions for it
__label__2 interface similar to wunderlist functionally not the same unfortunately as an example wunderlist allows manual sorting after sorting by one of the sort options alphabetical etc which can fine tune things beautifully microsoft to do does not allow manual sorting unless you deactivate the selected sort like deactivating alphabetical sort as an example this then reverts everything back to the same unsorted mess prior to the selected sort option very frustrating
__label__3 ehh it's just way too confusing for me to understand and do anything my health would probably go to 0 if i actually did know what i was doing anyways lmao
__label__5 great easy to use
__label__2 the new ''double reward feature is very upsetting and cheapening the whole point of this app is to help you focus and reduce phone distraction not barage you with ads for developer profit
__label__4 حلو جدا
__label__3 finally is working but i had to erase the data on my cellphone later i'm going to check what happened with the avatar until then the rating gonna stay still
__label__3 events disappear
__label__3 1 i didn't get the desktop icon 2 we tried sharing for shopping but it didn't sync
__label__2 notifications are not working properly it pop's up only when i open the app
__label__4 good easy to use
__label__3 the app crashes quite often recently but when it works it's really useful to manage events and meetings easy to use
__label__1 so many portions of the app we're not appearing on the screen from the get go including the first two screens entirely and even the avartar selections
__label__3 inspite of the event or task completed tasks being shown on the list as per the reminders and their timing auto arrangements of list is not there the first and most early created event is reflecting on the top rather than time based or priority based if an event created on my day if that was not completed its not getting carried over to next day as due
__label__2 free version does not allow you to view all your events in the monthly view i only see colored dots that indicate an event is scheduled i would like to see the event names i contacted support but sadly did not get a response
__label__3 didn't realize this synced to my outlook calendar started deleting work stuff and deleted two important appointments from my work calender i'm screwed on those was planning on using this for personal use only
__label__3 not sure bought the premium subscription for a year not sure though help pages are pretty good so i will keep working with this i like that it crosses my devices
__label__3 please keep a tab for accidentally deleted tasks if some 5 6 tasks gets accidentally deleted it gets very irritating to again set the tasks so it'd be a great idea to keep a recycle bin for the deleted tasks thanks
__label__4 prefering this over google calendar there is still an annoying bug where i cant edit delete events added to the calendar externally through a gym app for example pressing edit then it just goes back to the calendar view instead of to editing
__label__3 need notes option like wunderlist has get that and you'll get a 5 star i have the premium version and we want notes aswell as the chat please just like wunderlist
__label__5 it's a great up easy to use and very helpful if you want to create new habits and track your progress
__label__4 decent mate
__label__3 i couldn't find a way to link to google tasks that is my first priority so i have data backup and desktop list edits
__label__3 unnecessarily complex a simple one dimensional version would be fine
__label__3 great app however i was not able to sync with google calendar and it was a deal breaker for me uninstalling
__label__1 piece of poo
__label__3 generally i liked this app but i found it very frustrating that i couldn't view all my tasks in one area ie inbox or by by date i had to go through each list individually
__label__4 been using for about a year getting more and more useful every day works well across android ipad and windows 10
__label__2 please update the app i want to use the app but after a day alarm is not ringing i think this app have too much bugs and problems
__label__1 after the update all my completed sub tasks were deleted i set those up because i uncheck them every month when i need to use the same lists over and over really annoying especially since i don't think i'll be using the new features at all
__label__3 i like this app but recently it keep crashes i have already update to the latest version and it still keeps doing that i can't even open the app please help thank you
__label__3 used to be very good recently i'm experiencing disappearing of events and random switching of visible calendars
__label__3 i found that the several tabs was unnecessary and prevents me to be productive we have to pay for an app to get reminders i'll rather use an app with ads if the reminder function is gone
__label__4 i had a bad time with time management at work and at home now with my samsung and the routines i can get up this is the first app that wakes up in the morning giving me an opportunity to set up the day how i want and check them off as they're done
__label__3 worked great in beginning enjoy multiple lists sublists but now i have a task haunting me it won't let me delete it wrote developers we'll see using sg8
__label__4 love this app so far it just needs push notifications widgets and a habit tracker hut all in due time i'm sure
__label__1 good
__label__3 fairly awful followed all directions on how to cancel the yearly subscription within 2 days of starting my free 7 day trial charged on the 7th day anyway repeated requests to resolve the issue have been unanswered by the developer chose to go through google pay for refund thanks any do this will not be my last review i have much time on my hands now since your scheduler doesn't work
__label__1 absolutely do not upgrade to premium it does not work it does not sync the developer does not respond google play will not give a refund the frees app is flexible you can track yes no and count per day habits the count per day can be any criterion you want minutes calories quantity
__label__2 eh not great for a pay app
__label__1 wunderlist was awesome this replacement works slow with terrible ui and missing features from original app
__label__5 great better than keep i sorts out mess in your attic
__label__2 bought premium version didn't get upgrade sent proof of payment still no response not good
__label__3 i'm giving it three stars right now til i know how to properly use all the features but so far it's the best app i've used so far you can organize lists for home and work and other things so it's not confusing and easy to set dates
__label__5 awesome app
__label__5 it is absolutely amazing i can complete my tasks now very easily
__label__3 i hate the checkbox so much please make an option to remove them totally ruined the old nice swiping experience
__label__2 'it's free forever' but 'reminders are a premium feature ' hmm i'm dyspraxic without much money to waste and i'm looking for a to do list app to help with this without reminders this app is functionally useless to me disappointed that you've opted to content carve to this extent and i'd argue your claim of being free is misleading please reconsider which features to gatekeep because locking basic functions behind a paywall makes me less likely to support you financially
__label__2 got it primarily for reminders it has a lot of settings for how you want your alarms or notifications but those are pretty useless when they don't work didn't get a single notification to remind me of the stuff i set up
__label__3 sometimes the app will just stop working or the widgets won't work
__label__3 i couldn't find a way to link to google tasks that is my first priority so i have data backup and desktop list edits
__label__3 good app but sends too many notifications
__label__1 the app kept crashing when i tried to open it so i had to uninstall and reinstall the app please look into it for otherwise it's an awesome app
__label__4 reminders don't pop up if the app isn't open such as clearing all open tabs or if you haven't opened it at all in a day i think that's why the app should be for remind you because you may not have the time to it's a good app but pls i'd like that this be worked on i would also be nice if you can permit the option to pick alternating days or weeks as frequency of a task may not fall under weekly or daily e g tuesday thursdays and saturdays
__label__4 very happy with this app exactly what i needed just 1 issue if i put a repeating reminder for any task it works rings notifies only on the first day and nothing after that please fix this
__label__3 9am plan your day bothers a lot and i didn't find how to turn it off also reminders for events don't work and i relied on them a couple of times
__label__3 because it takes aiges to download
__label__4 it helped me alot and there is a bug if app is opened via notification message password will not be required no matter hope you fix this bug soon
__label__3 i think the app should request permission over other apps or if possible have it as a widget it keeps getting inactive when removed from recent files tab of the phone
__label__4 i'm using the app couple of years and i really nice it just really annoying when the reminder message pops up while you type a message or during the call while hanging up
__label__2 im sure the app is nice but i cannot add a routine or any activity nor i can delete anything
__label__1 purchased the full version which did nothing opted for a 24 hour face again nothing tried to add additional events in upcoming days did not show up at all
__label__5 great app love how you can easily attach it to your homescreen and interact with everything though the widget its completely changed how i've kept myself organized definitely the best one out there
__label__2 28 oct 2018 same problem repeating tasks do not update and advance to next due date when completed checks it as done and then unchecks sometime at night with previous due date 27 oct 2018 after hearing back from the author giving it another shot put two repeating tasks on it see how it goes 27 oct 2018 this app didn't work as well for me it would regularly uncheck tasks i'd completed or check tasks i'd not completed the repeating task function didn't work well either
__label__2 clunky complicated and confusing not streamlined ugly color choice for non pro just a disappointment
__label__5 this is awesome because the app helps you keep yourself on track it definetly helps when doing distance learning because of covid 19
__label__2 i was using this app just fine without problems for about 2 months but when my wife decided to get us both a subscription my account stopped working right whenever i check off a task i just get an error message and nothing gets counted i did everything the helpers told me clear cache reinstall the app restart phone and nothing worked its been about a week and i have yet to hear again from technical support
__label__3 quite boring app and can't add subtasks
__label__4 i love this app a lot but it keeps closing everytime i try to use it after a couple of inactive days it have to keep uninstalling and installing it please fix this problem soon i really enjoy this app
__label__1 i just bought premium and realized i made a mistake right away it told me to register to sync my data and i did sync option wouldn't do anything i wasn't able to set a username because of some unknown error all the time then half the screen was empty and i decided it was a glitch and reinstalled it and now all my data is gone so stupid i just paid 10 bucks to be able to create more than 5 habits and i lost everything don't recommend this app so disappointed
__label__5 great app with great notifications
__label__3 love this app i used to give it 5 stars but its so sliggish on the s8 and half the time the widget wont load
__label__3 app ui is really good i have tried almost all the top task list apps and like any do best however would like to have heisenberg matrix added to organise my tasks that is the one thing stoping me i want the quadrants features in this app and i would be absolute member of this app until forever
__label__3 please bring back the old ui for routine edits with horizontal stripes please or at least give the option to select a preference please thanks it makes it more editing a little more difficult and much less appealing please
__label__5 nothing better not sure how many years i have used this 5 years least i have tried everything out there but nothing works as well first it's easy second it's minimal i don't spend more time setting up organizing etc i spend my time doing what i need not taking time in the app third it's every where i need to access it is just easy and fast and i particularly love the reminder feature i used it free for awhile but have happily had premium for years
__label__1 used this app ages ago loved it got it back again last week but now i hate this app because it no longer works with my samsung gear fit2 pro deleting for good not happy
__label__3 this took quite a bit of setting up but now it is working again i like this calendar
__label__5 lite useful and great
__label__5 i am trying habits apps for more than 4 years this is the best at all
__label__1 if you pay for premium you won't actually get the premium services as other reviewers have noted troubleshooting steps from their site don't work and no one responds to the support email contact google and they'll reject your refund request
__label__3 love the app love the rewards but i wish that it showed you past dates and all you accomplished on days previous and i wish that the coloring of tasks wasn't so complicated when getting close to red or blue or whatever also certain things are hard to navigate but overall i absolutely love this app use it every day not so much for challenges or battles but for habit making and to do's
__label__2 the app does not sync our shared lists
__label__1 do not buy the premium if you need alexa and or outlook to integrate like they falsely claim this ap does or you need any support from todoist outlook integration has never been a synced integration it only forwards tasks one way only works with limited outlook paid platforms they have alexa issue notice seen only when you try to set it up no warning before buying believing you can integrate both no support response yet i want my money back such waste of hours i feel scammed
__label__1 didn't sync at all with current list
__label__5 very good and far better than most of the similar apps that i have tried so far it would be great if weekly schedule could be added for an specific habit so you could be reminded at different times during different days of the week which sounds more functional and reasonable as we usually don't have a fixed routine during the week needless to say what a big improvement a companion smart watch app would be
__label__2 notifiction is not working properly when i set a task reminder when it is near finish dead line app doesnot send me task notification about its deadline not working
__label__4 great for adhd
__label__2 there's no simple reminders or ability to add to do task everything has to be added via calendar which is irritating me app is useless right now
__label__3 this app would do better with a calculator tat adds subtracts shopping list columns with totals also tabs swipes for delete retrieve update 2 16 20 1 you can't edit actual item on a list like change it's name 2 and you can't see or do a running sub total add or subtract price totals what good is a list tat when u put the price of a item your task list can't be more helpful when creating a cost grocery list or whatever like hardware store items list so i deleted
__label__5 this app is the best i started leaving my games youtube social media and just organizing my life through this it started organising everything in my life from the grocery lists to my studying lists to my cleaning lists to the calender and all of these and i still didnt participate in the premium of this app it is amazing even without it though i think it would be better with it this application is thr best life organiser download it now for free for better life
__label__5 this is just great i saw my favorite youtuber using this and i was like what the hell is she using that enables you so much facilities like you are bound6to stay focused i literally searched for the name of this app and i finally found it i am using it for 1 month now and it's the best but sometimes it just don't notifies me when the time is over and sometimes just keeps counting the time even when i m watching youtube or instagram on my phone
__label__3 good in general but too many little bugs here and there
__label__5 love it
__label__4 i have found this app helps me stick to my daily schedule
__label__3 showed promise but let down by an incredibly stupid copy function
__label__1 the one thing that made this app better than the others was that it was ad free uninstalling
__label__3 i have been using this app ever since i switched to an android phone 5 6 years ago and i have liked it for the most part however the recent addition of the focus button in the pop up reminder bar is annoying focus is only available in the premium version and there's no way to turn it off time to shop for a new to do list app
__label__5 i like it because i can keep track of things i need to do i like the highlighted color it's a good sky blue and it's easy to make lists it feels good to complete a list that takes a long time to complete it's good for making for later and good for getting things done i give it 5 stars
__label__4 great app easy to use nice design motivating statistics and quotes thank you developers for this app only one remark from me if i change the number of repetitions per week of an activity it changes the whole statistics also for the previous period maybe there could be an option to apply this change only to further period e g when i start an activity twice a week it becomes a habit and i want to increase it to 3 times a week and i don't want to lose worsen previous statistics
__label__4 this is the only app that does what it does and i love the functionality the only problem is the app is quite buggy and i haven't seen or noticed any updates in years would also be nice if there was a website to go with it i am finally giving up and moving to day by day which leverages google calendar and google tasks if google would just incorporate tasks into its calendar better that would do it all
__label__2 3 a month to use most of the app na features are nice but disappointed i can't just buy the app
__label__2 you want me to pay 5 for the full version so i can set a task to repeat my phone's planner does that for free
__label__3 please provide a 'today' smart list that shows items due today it should not be necessary to manually add tasks to a today list that's a waste of everyone's time
__label__3 i paid for the pro version after playing with the app for a few minutes was hoping to use this to help manage my adhd but i have two big issues with the app 1 i can't find a way to edit routines after they've already been created without deleting the whole day i don't think there is 2 after i clear a day the app shuts down i can deal with the second issue until an update but i don't think i would have purchased the upgraded version if i would have been aware of the first issue still three stars because other than the glitch missing feature the app does exactly what it says it will
__label__5 bestestestestestest
__label__2 why do you have to give them your info when all i'm wanting is a grocery list and things to do ain't none of their business
"__label__3 it's to complicated to really be useful it's a great concept but i with 
the interface was simpler"
__label__3 its a cool app it really is but developers need to understand that a subscription based system is not for every app im fine paying a subscription fee to netflix or spotify because there is new content almost daily but i refuse to pay a subscription fee for a todo list app make a payed app ill buy it for 30 bucks what i wont is give you 3 bucks a month everymonth and add yet another subscription fee to my list
__label__3 absolutely love this app and have been using it for months different lists in different screens via the widget unfortunately the widgets have become unresponsive and now i'm looking for a new app will this be fixed using huawei p20 pro mate for reference edit i have reinstalled the app taken the app off battery saver mode when i reinstalled it is still the same clicking on the widget does nothing can't add tasks at all
__label__1 reminders are a premium feature
__label__3 reminders are premium kind of denotes the point of having a to do list
__label__4 superb concept but not able to sync outlook calendar with app rather it's picking events from local mobile oppo calendar want to sync outlook gmail calendars please help
__label__3 i must say ur reminder doesn't work at all i m not satisfied
__label__5 i chose this calendar for its widgets which are the best among all the apps i tried this combined with fine controls are the reasons i haven't looked back for several years now
__label__3 i would be happy to give the app a five star rating as i have reaped many benefits i directly relate to my usage of habitica but i am prevented from doing so by recent events i can only give you a three star rating because suddenly your application no longer functions with no warning or information as to why or how to fix it 500 characters is not enough to relay proper data on this issue to the dev team likely by design and for that i blame google play not the dev team of habitica
__label__1 not compatible with older samsung tablet what a crock it's a to do app explain why wunderlist can run but not this app
__label__3 still working on use
__label__5 the best todo app i've ever used 100 10 would recommend
__label__1 annoying obstructive ads got fed up after one had a fake x button that was designed to trick you into tapping on it
__label__5 best to do list app i've tried so many to do list app bit this is certainly the best
__label__3 new to the app so still learning
__label__5 i believe that this is by far the best app with helping ppl keep track of a lot of daily task and reminders it's easy to function understand it syncs with my google calendar which is an a in my book
__label__3 the user interfaceis not good enough it is not that much understandable
__label__1 useless
"__label__3 can you make the graph fully editable eg without importing from calendars 
i want to be able to add stuff without it having to access my calendar"
__label__4 would be great if all the features were free
__label__4 very helpful in getting me to do stuff but i wish reminders were free
__label__3 beautiful
__label__3 new
__label__3 doesn't save habit data when you switch to a new phone even using the same login information won't let me choose a start date for my habit either so it never shows 100 success like it should
__label__4 pretty good but it'd be better of there was some kind of mini game option where your avatar does stuff like fighting or studying along with you i dunno it'd just be fun to have that extra interaction and to give meaning to the points system
__label__3 needs fixes like the repetition is screwed also the generate habit looks like the developers don't use it themselves
__label__3 i really can't speak to the full experience because i do not have the premium version but so far the free version has helped me with keeping my projects and tasks in one place i am still getting the hang of prioritizing but that is more of a personal thing
__label__4 lot more easy and practical maintaining calendar is fun loved the widget
__label__2 i'm facing a problem that is reminders are not working properly device lenovo k3 note android 6 0
__label__4 hii and
__label__1 dont work the best it got was the vibration notification worked i can't get any sound at all from this app
__label__4 although it's very helpful but make a navbar of all the lists or try to show all the lists in list format when we open the app so that we can see which lists are there
__label__3 when i'm entering birthdays i have to enter on the day after or it shows up the day before i have one birthday permanently hooked to a holiday and i can't edit it fix this please
__label__4 becoming undispensable very fast
__label__2 it good and useful app
__label__3 would be great to have notes implement into the app that way it would be a bit more multifunctional
__label__3 so far im loving it but i could not find a setting to change first day of the week from sunday to monday which is very confusing please add this feature
__label__4 i like this app a lot one thing that stops me from buying pro version is that i desparately need it to export routines to my google calendar now i think that it is just possible from google calendar to timetune that is because the interface of timetune is much much better than google calendar interface and i need all my routines in google calendar in order to sync it with my google home speaker so it can read it out loud every time i ask and remind me even without my phone
__label__1 really frustrating experience the list sharing is incredibly frustrating my wife and i were on several lists together on wunderlist and when we transfered to this new app we had to text message the lists we shared she shared some of the same lists with me and now we have duplicate lists it's completely fubar we are abandoning the platform now to find something better
__label__5 i've tried many productivity hacks tools and methods this app is something that has stayed consistent throughout it has everything you need in one place no ads and the pro features are for things that are extra like for a company or team my favorite part is how much you can customize every to do list folder and sub folder to go with your personal style of working definitely worth downloading
__label__3 não consigo mudar a linguagem já fui nas opções e tudo mas sempre atualiza e fica no inglês
__label__4 i love this app and i definitely recommend just sad that the timer wont be available in the app anymore it was very useful
__label__3 i really miss some stuff what is available in wunderlist 1 all the tasks in different lists that is available in the general task list not only planned tasks 2 the option to show new task on top of list 3 option to move important tasks to the top 4 option to show task for the week bring that ib and you will definitly get a 5
__label__3 this app was very helpful up until the last update where they inexplicably took away the lock forest to stay in foreground feature as of right now it's basically useless but the support staff is great and said they were hoping to bring back the feature so other than that it would be 5 stars don't change the feature that keeps people off their phones
__label__5 love it it is a great app with a very beautiful yet minimalistic design i was looking for some watchface that showed my calendar events and this is perfect the homescreen widget for the phone is great too and all of that for free excluding some minor features like 24h time and in depth customization i can definetly recommend this app
__label__4 the app looks like it will be great but it has only picked up half of what is on my calendar
__label__3 doesn't offer too many options to notes and writing listing text fonts and sizes tools and resources are very simple and limited
__label__3 it's really cute and motivating but what i'm missing would be an option to set a tree to be planted at a specific time
__label__4 good app but it needs to have tasks accepted from google calender
__label__2 good app but don't bother with premium i bought premium for the powerful widgets and ability to track extra habits don't bother the widgets are nothing special and if you read the tips section the developer even says it's best to only track a few habits at a time after feeling ripped off i emailed the developer twice requesting a refund but have received no reply great free app but don't waste your money on premium
__label__4 very useful application thanks could you please add tags grouping because i have created multiple different tags and now it is really mess
__label__2 i m just very lazy enough to use this app plus this app is not based on concept of habit building let's see how habbit is built u do task u get reward but here for sake of reward u only get dots connected in pattern that's not motivating instead u can give some offers as reward
__label__2 with so many free calendar apps out there there's just nothing in the free version of this one to make you choose it the only feature that might set it apart from the competition is the project feature but you have to pay to use it sure you have the notes feature but there are ways to accomplish the same thing in pretty much any other calendar so i just can't see the point rather than pay for an upgrade to an app that's just ho hum the view isn't even very customizable i'll be uninstalling
__label__3 guys excellent app bad financial model prepared to pay reluctant about subscription model unfortunately uninstall
__label__5 great calendar for how i want my information displayed tried most of the calendar apps and this one was the only one i immediately liked and did not really need to learn for reference i use thunderbird as my computer email application
__label__4 works great most of the time however crashes when making my display size small google pixel recurring error
__label__3 how can i set a task to repeat daily or weekly
__label__2 time changing on widget is not responsive enough need bout 1 mins
__label__3 no experience with it install open goes to a login screen no thanks i do not want to login to use this i'd appreciate it if developers would say upfront that their app is not a standalone local private version too bad could have been just what i need otherwise sure looks good to dev thanks for the response i rechecked neither the images nor writeup specifies an account is mandatory can is different than must updated with extra star for prompt service thx
__label__5 i'm glad it's app have clear more
__label__4 fun for university students the only problem is they don't order the tasks by date do you have to be careful not to miss homework now that i think about it it's actually a big problem for students using the app it is fun overall and i do homework to keep my avatars alive think tamagotchi
__label__1 i'd like to give it a 5 star very much the app is very useful convenient and easy to use and what's even better is that it allows the user to modify the alarm sound icon etc as we please that makes it much easier to organize our schedule but the app no longer works after i've changed my phone i don't know if the issue is about my phone i used mi a1 before and oppo currently or the app i've read about the configuration to get the app back to work but to no avail please help ty
__label__1 broken from the start can't do anything
__label__5 i've used planner pro for 5 years or more now couldn't do without it
__label__3 nice one
__label__2 i was recommended this app by a friend who loves it i got the premium version as i expected it to have better features this app is very confusing to use i even went to the help section and was even more confused i'm very disappointed
__label__1 why do you say that you can disable permissions at any time but then the app doesn't work at all if you do why have an app on your phone that you will never use i have disabled the google app on my phone for a reason it's gone completely psycho generating up to three completely nonsensical events and associated 6 reminders every week the only way to stop it was to completely disable it why do you think i was looking for a calendar app to begin with why do you need another calendar app in
__label__2 nice looking ui but inability to disable popups is a deal breaker for me uninstalled
__label__4 updated review based on developer reply sadly not for me for example you can't 1 turn off vibration when reordering tasks 2 quickly select multiple tasks to assign labels 3 view a list sorted by label tag 4 add priority to tasks only labels which you cannot use for sorting the list
__label__5 it is the best app i ever downloaded to keep track of things that needs to be done im a proctastinator forgetful and know how hard it is to get things done but this app eliminates the hassle of forgetting tasks
__label__3 we are missing a chat feature and notification when a task is changed completed modified in shared lists any do is pretty good for my personal use but even though we are both premium we don't see any possibility of interaction with the kind of interaction wunderlist provides not just tiny notification within the app
__label__3 good but flawed the app does not support tasks from caldav such as icloud reminders
__label__3 i have the app on my phone and my ipad and they do not communicate everything that i input on my phone i have to re input on my ipad i'm signed into the same account on both it would be nice if they would communicate also i don't understand why the computer app is available separately and for a much more expensive price
__label__3 by how clean sleek it is only efficient and pretty planner out there but the task widget doesnt update at all
__label__3 this app is a fantastic idea but man is it buggy i'm constantly having to restart the app or check it later because it's bugging out would be 5 stars otherwise
__label__2 not remind me
__label__3 hell
__label__3 it's better to have biweekly schedule im using this app to manage my to do list unfortunately it doesnt have every other week schedule or biweekly schedule to be honest i have lot of things to do during that schedule because my oayout is every other week so i really need to have that kind of schedule olease add that up thank you
__label__3 super
__label__2 i really dislike the projects thing just let me make new lists i want a list for movies to watch another for gift ideas etc the best way to do that through this app is subitems which are a pain to deal with moving over to wunderlist
__label__5 great
__label__3 everything is premium lots of useful things are premium and you actually have to buy them everything except that is good
__label__3 great app needs a few things like task fail without consequences option mostly a full paid version without subscription or in app purchase not every one has everything connected to internet all the time
__label__1 doesnt work on all android wear os devices specifically doesnt work with the watch active2
__label__1 it was pretty hard to set up a task i wanted to set a task that would happen tommorow but i couldnt do it because it was 1 in the morning it also was very challenging to set up tasks in general i couldn't for instance make a task that repeated and set the time of the task it was also very hard to customize i usually learn how to use apps very easily it's like they went out of their way to make it as hard as possible don't waster your time with this
__label__4 working great for me simple to use relatively detailled free
"__label__3 i accidently swipe going to the right it erase task i have to write it 
again but everything else is ok"
__label__3 too complex as a game the time i spent tried to understanding how it work could have been spent actually working
__label__3 i love it compared to other apps like it but i do miss the features that epic win has that you can sort your to do s based on the day so you can set up to dos for the future while in habits it all shows in one list instead of being separated by date
__label__3 well it was good until it just kept crashing and i don't know why
__label__3 useful app
__label__2 cannot create new tags even deleted a few to test if it was because i had reached an undeclared quota
__label__1 great concept but executed poorly i added 2 events between 6 30am and 9 30 but when i tried adding one for 10 30am it would let me saying it overlapped with another event which it did not i even checked my calendar and nothing was there for that time it's now 11 42am i tried adding an event for 3 30pm and it said its saved but hasn't showed on the clock or anything so it's pretty useless at this point
__label__1 key functionalities of the app are hidden behind a subscription of 6 50 per month with the best deal simply shameless
__label__3 i loved using this app but now it is not working at all i can't sign in even after paying
__label__3 it works but i can't sync my goals with my tablet
__label__1 synchronization does not work since last update with chrome extension i think in year 2020 when there are services such as firebase this should be normal however it is not
__label__4 so far so good i love the reminders because they check in you throughout the day rather than just once a day this has definitely helped me develop a routine i may keep it on longer than the prescribed 66 days the app claims it takes that long to develop a lasting habit but the daily reminders help me best this app is good for that
__label__5 i use to do to track my college assignments and projects i had tried several other systems but none had the organizational power of to do i love that i can have a list for each class and attach a due date to each assignment it the built in planned list pulls all assignments from my different classes into one list and sorts them by due date i'm also planning to start using it for my getting things done system david allen which i currently have in evernote it's a huge win for me
__label__1 used it until simple backup was premiumized restore wont work between different versions unless you modi hack the file author would not tell you that you can do it though if you ask his help restore dont recognize my backup file at all so all my lists are basically inaccessible now will never install this again and i suggest anyone who values his data not to
__label__3 was working fine for couple years now 1 it creates duplicates of repeating events 2 while trying to change notification sounds it switched to silent with no way to restore 3 faq to allow single repeated event deletion says to sync to get 'only this event' but 'sync now' closes menu w o synching
__label__4 i like this app i only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience i hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved i would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough
__label__5 every customisable feature you could think of
__label__1 i wanted a to do list this is not such continually asking to name things unnecessarily complicated kiss
__label__3 the photos that described what the app was about made it seem like the whitelist was just part of the app edit what what kind of a responce is that
__label__2 can't use with vpn i practice information security and prefer to use a vpn whenever i can i use 2 norton nordvpn not of course at the same time in both usage cases when my vpn is activated it would say there is no connection i have even tried different servers is there a reason that vpns are a problem for your service how is your data management security does your company view people's data how do you keep others from being to steal others data because username passcodes
__label__3 routine module and programming is nice any plans to make it a tracker app log if the schedule event is accomplished completely partially or not accomplished for example drinking water few times a day exercising 1hr per day
__label__3 its serves a purpose
__label__3 why notifications do not work e i y day i put daily
__label__1 update only manual sync works down to 1 until you fix this best calendar out there love it it looks great works flawlesly erganomics ease of use is absolutely outstanding and i'm sure it tastes good as well if you could eat it
__label__3 good but repeat mode is not working properly i am looking for some other app
__label__5 such a great app i use it dozens of times each day
__label__4 i like this apps but i would like it better if it can show event description
__label__3 just new
__label__5 i've used planner pro for 5 years or more now couldn't do without it
__label__4 i like the app a lot but some features are a little annoying i have a few suggestions more ways to tweak what the widgets look like currently they take up a lot of space it would be nice to see the completed tasks together with active tasks instead of them disappearing task subcategories please biggest gripe because of the way the entire list item is like a button i keep accidentally checking tasks that weren't actually done bugged unchecking pls fix thanks
__label__5 just started but easy to use not accustom to all features but this app makes sense
__label__4 very helpful to keep me on task with work home life
__label__2 need wifi data for it i get that you can play with your friends but it would be nice if i could use it without wifi for data anyway i have a limited ammout of data and brain memory so by the time i get home after all day i've forgotten my habits and the point becomes mute only gave this an extra star because i love the 8 bit art
__label__3 it's easy and friendly simple and nice ui i think it can be better if we define time for doing and the app suggest day or devided to some part
__label__3 no sweet thanks
__label__2 tedious and annoying to use went back to using google keep
__label__5 xxx
__label__4 make it easier to understand when you're activating quests i didn't have anyone in my party by i was still somehow doing it and finished it by myself without realizing it make a design change renaming so that there's something labeled start quest still a fun and useful app growth is neverending
__label__3 good app
__label__1 don't lock reminders behind a pay wall or if you do make it a 1 time purchase
__label__3 implement collaborative lists please so crucial
__label__5 works great no ads no unnecessary complexity
__label__5 vb
__label__2 okayish
__label__1 can only put 5 tasks before having to pay
__label__5 best app for time management
__label__1 i loved this app until i paid for the premium version now it won't let me purchase any new trees and i don't have the option to earn double points this was so much better when it was free please fix the issues
__label__3 interrupting buzzing the app makes a buzzing noise while i use it first one long silence interrupted by a buzz short silence then buzz before a long silence
__label__1 guys where is the option to record a voice note like winderlist or add file oooh are you serious you forgot this significant option
__label__3 good start would love to see clean material design implemented personally i need the option of a full task list view in my task widget again good start
__label__2 i love nearly everything about this app but it eats up the battery on my phone like crazy because it is always running in the background
__label__1 no longer syncs
__label__5 i have always had problems when it comes to structure in my life this app was a beautiful addition to my transformation in life if i ever got slack or forgot to do something i will make up for it the next day or even do it on the same day seeing consistency visually has definitely helped me to maintain structure and positive repetition thank you to the creators of this amazing app goodluck to anyone who has attracted this app
__label__2 when i checklist today's note automatically overdue's note checked too what's wrong
__label__5 integrates google calendar well has a clean interface and easy to add one time and recurring events i've tried many and keep coming back to business calendar
__label__1 good
__label__3 a good app although disappointed that i can't repeat a reminder without paying
__label__5 i just love it it's so simple without so many colors that stun the brain i like
__label__5 wonderful app unique and very useful great design and functionality
__label__1 i give it one star because the main feature is broken for me i set pill reminders on daily cycle but it misses the notification sometimes i tried adding the app to not optimized battery but it still misses reminders
__label__3 please make offline version because most of studious people cannot afford online apps so if you want good ratting please make part 2 offline
__label__4 great app please fix alarm popup not autohides or show longer time ex 5 10min
__label__4 i like it it's quite easy to use would it be possible to sync data between devices that would be a lovely plus
__label__4 had written a bad review because i spent a week trying to make the app show two widgets with different calendars couldn't do it and wasted hours until i noticed a nearly invisible dot at least on my screen i'm using the iblue app near the widgets pressed it and discovered the widget menu they should really make it stick out or write clear instructions about it on the app i imagine they try to make it subtle in order to not affect how the app looks but it took a week to find it
__label__2 it just keep on showing only one event whereas there are more than one events
__label__2 this is far from what wunderlist made us use it you no longer have details section in a task where for example you could add a link to a picture or describe more the task in hand it seems it tried to be more of a daily scheduler than what actually the amazing wunderlist was
__label__2 the idea is amazing and it's useful except it stop working can't show its widget after update
__label__5 very nice widgets available
__label__3 it's got a steep learning curve and i don't think it's got good documentation help faqs
__label__4 easy to add habits and tasks you see everything for that dat
__label__3 passive but good
__label__2 it was good until the recent updates i installed this app because of its widget however the recent update destroyed everything that i have customised there are a lot of setting to make the widget looks good but the update limited the setttings i event went all out in purchasing the app thinking it could be like it used to be maybe i can change it back with unlimited setting but it's not as good as before im disappointed
__label__1 loaded the trial then emailed about cancelation but email bounced back ended up paying 36 for an app i didn't want no way to contact for refund be careful if you buy this if you try the trial you're stuck paying for it
__label__2 i love this app but recently the app keeps crashing everytime i enter plus the calendar is completely wrong
__label__3 this app is great but one thing that bugs me is that it doesnt have the option to attach images to the tasks you can comment images within a task but i just wish you could directly attach them so you could see it underneath a task rather than having to click on the task then go into comments
__label__3 ok i like it but know what the experience points keep expanding but not with health simultaneously you will be sent backward everytime you lose your health while to refill health you need to max up the exp point please fix this
__label__5 i really loved it i'm more organized 3
__label__1 very good app but in widget there is a no option in list wise select today tomorrow or all please update for this option then it will be far better please update example if there's a call list in widget it shows in call widget list all call today tomorrow other all day but it should option to select today tomorrow etc
__label__1 the app is broken right now downloaded today to try it out and the first two slides were blank character creation is all blank unfortunately deleted but was looking forward to trying this has been catalogued by others when its fixed i'll try again but so far it seems that this app is only really properly supported for iphone users i have a samsung s9
__label__4 good
__label__5 this app is just what i have been looking for it really feels like a paper planner
__label__3 please ad an option to turn off check boxes on the widget since it was added i'm constantly checking off items by mistske once you do this it is tedious to get the item back
__label__4 great app for planning the missing 5th star is because the reminders are restricted and not personalizable if you want to be reminded at a specific hour of the day you can't
__label__3 it did improve over time but still needs things like every other day 5th or last friday of the month every 3 months etc went back to tasks notes for office 365 much better i'd this gets that good i'll be back
__label__5 great app i joined a group chat and we all work together at the same time it's a lot more motivating than studying alone i love the idea that we can help plant real tress too what an excellent cause i love the idea of painting a virtual forest too
__label__1 bad the reminders not working many times trouble shooting
__label__3 it was really good for helping me to get motivated for a few days but when i shut my phone off the notifications stop coming until i open the app again and check off something
__label__3 has potential but i need it for the programer which costs money
__label__1 thanks for answering but nothing has changed i have tried everything but it just won't help me like it used to
__label__3 it seems to be improved and noted no option to delete routines and need to go all the days and delete
__label__3 habit syncing not working on paid version app is great but after phone resets and all my habits data of 2 months is lost and the app is showing i don't have a internet connection even though i am writing this review on same internet connection but other than that app works great the widget is great and i use it daily
__label__3 wants me to write a username but says username already taken even when i put nonsense in
__label__3 really like the app however it is multiplying my tasks on a daily basis and i cant delete them as fast as they appear frustraring not using it right now
__label__3 fine
__label__3 it's pretty neat i love the how everything pops out on the clock only thing is i tried scheduling things after 12 pm and it wouldn't pop up and i notice it only shows 12 hours at a time if you buy the pro version it comes with the 24 hour feature which i think is totally worth it seeing 24 hour option you can see everything from start to finish and not miss anything
__label__3 gotta be kidding me i don't mind paying premium but not for adding notes to a task no way this feature is free on every one of the 100 todo apps in play other things should be charged for
__label__3 pls add 24 hour view
__label__5 awesome creativity
__label__5 good concept would go for premium if price adjusted to be a bit more reasonable to give context other productivity apps created with a similar aim are around the 2 10 mark
__label__1 not bad
__label__2 had to switch from wunderlist to do lacks functions which make wunderlist so great importing worked well but sharing previously shared lists required me to make a new 'personal' account this wasn't an issue before all is set up now and the app feels limited still in themes and settings most of all why switch why not just rename wunderlist to say 'microsoft wunderlist'
__label__3 really great concept but not much useful and not even that beautifully eye catching thing
__label__1 app didn't sync at all i lost almost 6 months and it turned out all users had the same issue and requested a refund i need my money or solve it now this is cheating
__label__1 all i want is a calendar this app spams you so much 1 star
__label__3 it's amazing and it helps me so much when writing but these days it keeps crashing all the time
__label__1 it doesn't ring the alarm at the right time only when i open my phone it starts ringing useless for me because i want it to ring at the right time and remind me on my realme phone highly disappointed
__label__1
__label__3 useful easy to use and fulfil my needs but i still didn't experience it's use in sharing or groups
__label__4 i like the app i even paid premium for it but can you please make it connect in to the app when i press the widget
__label__3 not for me
__label__4 really like this app especially when i can categorise the different reminders
__label__4 i've used all of the popular and some of the lesser known to do list apps this is by far my favorite you don't have to have an account and has more options but you should for back up purposes the only problem i have is that when i miss a task it says due 10 minutes ago when it's been 2 hours my tasks do show up on time though the times vary but this issue started when i created an account
__label__4 new update made me little bitter in routine section kindly take it back and give the old one in the routine section first the app allowed me to edit the routine of daily easily and separately but now all the days are one by one and not side by side actually side by side is best and easy to edit thank you for your reply
__label__5 i have used several habit tracking apps and this one is the best it is easy to use and i like the way it gives my percentage success rate and my streaks a lot of the other apps wanted a monthly subscription fee i paid for the pro version after using the free version since it was a one time payment
__label__3 please please weekly plan
__label__4 this app is great and i'm sticking to it the only issue i have with it is the notification it doesn't work when the app is closed please fix that
__label__4 amazing application gamifying basic tasks really motivates me to complete them also naturally teaches about goal structuring comparatively not as good as the browser based version simple things like an in app pop up for completing a quest haven't been transcribed over looking forward to that optimization thanks for the great tool
__label__5 i've been using the app for more than a year and it's a real thing very functional and customizable in many different ways i simply can't use another calendar app since i started using it
__label__4 great motivator to keep a habit going also good for keeping track of habits you already have they have great insightful options that help you set your goal tried a similar highly rated app forgot its name and this one destroys it immediately uninstalled the other one there are a few quarks here and there they can improve but overall i really like this app and have recommended kt to friends and family
__label__2 it used to be a good app until they added the latest update which includes ridiculously annoying ads and frequent crashes
__label__4 would be perfect if you also have pomodoro timer to do each task
__label__4 good app but not what im looking for i'd like to be able to check items off my routine as i complete them but i cannot do that i do like that there are a variety of tags to choose from and that i can create my own tags i also like that you can clone a routine over several days
__label__5 i love this for lists currently i am using it to keep track if my school work while over this school break
__label__1 i bought pro version and paid twice still haven't been delivered the pro features
__label__5 honestly great simple effective 1 time purchase the ui has a sort of dated look but it's very quick and easy to use most of my daily habits vary alot based on which day it is my schedule varies so much i cant put them on a specifik time and i almost always do them in the same order therefore there should be an option to change the order of the habits manually yourself without any variables
__label__1 i found it odd that the app didn't have preset hourly reminders most people have habits that require them to do them on specific hours for example gyming twice or thrice a day the app should have a feature on where you can input the exact times in the day when it should remind you another example of this would be reminder on every thursdays at 7am and 8pm i should be reminded of insert habit instead it's jungle of toggles that seem to not make sense
__label__5 simple and neat
__label__3 routine maker is amazing but notifications are not coming when the phone is in lock mode so i uninstalled it
__label__3 have been having issues since last update when adding a to do it defaults to go to the inbox folder instead of going right to 'today' list so have been forgetting to do stuff because i didn't see it lol 5 stars otherwise once the issue is fixed edit sane thing happens when i am on today tab and have it set as homepage
__label__4 i really like it easy to use just wish it would remind me again after the time has elapsed without having to reset the time for the task other than that it's great
__label__5 i have enjoyed using the app i like that you can plan to do something and it's tossed into the void or tossed into a bucket for planning later i wish i could hide buttons related to premium features but once you get used to what is what you can avoid them
__label__4 wish you could set tasks to recur at regular times but it's a good app overall
__label__4 great app but is subscription based app
__label__1 i get it you want me to upgrade not even tried the app and you shove it in my face i don't like at all how it's all just promoting your pro version delete your account it wants your password for your gmail account this is a privacy breach also so many things wrong with this app and their ethos none of the integrations work unless you pay them totally money grab these guys as i've read elsewhere i've deleted it now it made me feel they have been so intrusive with what they are doing
__label__3 easy to use
__label__5 love that you can have several lists and sub lists and set reminders deadlines
__label__3 add option to upload to drive
__label__4 brilliant app
__label__4 great app too bad a lot of helpful features are for premium only i'd like to have a calendar layout of the week
__label__5 great app also worth it to get the premium for a small one time payment
__label__2 i don't know why they changed it but i hate the fact that you can't type in the time anymore you have to scroll like you're on wheel of fortune or something that is the biggest pain in the behind ever invented i don't mind it if there's a option but this doesn't appear to give you a choice anymore please change it back
__label__1 this app requires users to create an account with either fb or gmail to use it then you find yourself in a 7 day free trial in order to pay later not encouraging to even try it at least inform users that's it's not free before asking access to their fb or gmail accounts
__label__5 it is a very nice app it remixes you and you will never miss any task it reminds you with alarm or notification it really helped me
__label__5 sweet app super clean interface simple and straightforward me likey
__label__3 this app is great and it already helping me stay on track with some things it's surprising how much imaginary experience points can motivate but i am having a bug where dailies can't be set for a given day they just revert to all days being checked i want this app to keep me accountable for working out on certain days so this is a major flaw
__label__1 looked at it and it appears that the apps is signed as a subscription trying to find out if it is subscriped or not do not want the app
"__label__3 i'm liking the app so far but the widget does not sync with the app so 
renders that function useless suggestion to add a refresh button to the 
widgets so i don't have to open the app every time"
__label__5 this is a great app to manage schedule interface and otherthings are perfect but i wish that the on screen notification should be like the lock screen popup notification
__label__5 handy for me when i need to plan out everything that needs to be done
__label__4 a great way to keep myself focused i enjoy the different tree options and seeing the forests i grow every day good way to measure my producticity levels too
__label__2 could not get app to consistently stay connected to my google calendars
__label__3 true a unsnecessarypts at r
__label__4 not very intuitive sometimes but a useful app i use daily
__label__5 exceptional service
__label__4 nothing is ideal but this app helped me to write a song and make my own project it's funny that same time i grow a beautiful garden thanks
__label__4 it would be more useful if user can provide interdependence and correlation between various actions and lists
__label__5 just swapped from wunderlist to microsoft to do so far happy with it and not really noticing any difference or loss of functionality
__label__2 the moderation of the discussion bards in the app leaves something to be desired needs better moderation
__label__2 it's a great idea but it just doesn't work the pages never refresh for the next day and if i press the refresh button it just comes up with an unable to connect to server error or just stays with the loading symbol infinitely i went on it today after not going on it for a couple of days and i just find that im dead out of nowhere the refill health prompt kept repeatedly popping up and then when it stopped my health bar was still at zero also the add habit button isnt there always
__label__4 hi i love the app there's a bug that i want to share i created a daily task once a day but it doesn't go away after completing it from today's task what do i do thank you
__label__5 it's a good app
__label__2 not a movable app
__label__3 odd that it doesnt count beginning and end of month corrctly in monthly tally
__label__2 hi i really love this app so i bought the pro version however when i click on the button to sign up nothing shows up i was hoping someone could help me with this issue to correct it
__label__3 great app
"__label__3 as a taxi driver i do runs for two friends at all times of the day and 
night i've downloaded loads of these things trying to find one that i can 
simply put in a job with a simple title like 'bristol airport pickup' with 
the time i want to be reminded not the time i make the first pickup and 
one that i can add notes to for phone numbers first pickup address and 
fare most importantly it must sound the notification even if mute is on at 
night and early mornings when ai am asleep every one i tried did the first 
two none did the latter two this one it does let me add notes but sadly 
does not make the notification sound when the phone is on silent which is a 
big oversight so it is of no use to me apart from runs when i am awake 
please fix tbis and i will hapily buy it please also add a feature so i 
can choose what reminder sound i want instead of it using the default 
notification sound"
__label__4 hi i previously posted a review to this app and i was furious i gave it a single star because many choices are premium but when i started to use the app i learnt that this is app is really good for productivity and i am glad that i am using it i can't say it's perfect without you paying for the premium version but it's pretty good app
__label__5 this app is just perfect it helped me to manage my time so that i didn't waste any of my time i highly recommend it to others
__label__2 just uninstalled it it looks a great app but one its fundamental features reminder was available only in premium mode
__label__1 was really enjoying this then the notifications just stopped which is a big part of what i needed the app for annoying finding a new app for this now
__label__5 awesome increses productivity
__label__3 there's this weird bug now where the screen dims and keeps showing the loading sign but you can still use the buttons please fix it
__label__5 excellent the best to do app out there
__label__2 it's been really helpful for habit building but it's now bugging like crazy and crashing every time i open it so not wonderful
__label__3 displaying the contacts calendar of every google account cannot be deactivated in calendar tasks list it re activates immediately
__label__3 i was noticed that my phone memory is low and when i was checking which apps i can move to external memory sd card i found that i can't install move your app to the phone's sd card and use it from it but only on and from phone's internal memory as i see that is not an issue by many other apps with similar features and requirements so i suggest you to make this possible
__label__3 you can put tasks on
__label__3 not for me
__label__5 one word to describe this app is amazing ultimate app for to do and habit tracking after many years a single app has impressed me so much highly recommended
__label__5 it good
__label__3 im only doing this because it would not stop telling me give then a rating hence the lower score pretty good app and the best part is it has a widget and only a one time fee to have full access to app
__label__3 just ok
__label__4 real nice app i like links to google calendar for events reminders not sure about tasks have you guys thought about drag and drop between tasks and events it'd be perfect for time blocking or scheduling tasks right now i use a zapier that takes new tasks in a specific list and lists them as 5 am on today's calendar i'd like to drag them to certain times so my schedule doesn't fill up shows time blocks as busy in calendar thanks
__label__2 used to be a great app though the most recent update has made the widget unusable too small to see and there is no way to change the size you also can no longer select multiple tasks or pop out the widget to see multiple days i requested to go back to the previous version but didn't get much response so now i'm looking for a replacement
__label__1 want upgraded version even to set the duration pathetic app
__label__3 why notifications do not work e i y day i put daily
__label__3 phone computer sync could be improved also doesn't have a timer for your rest between pomodoros
__label__1 it's a to do list why do i have to buy the premium to get reminder
__label__2 let's be honest here if you need help with basic habit management you won't use this regularly enough to help and if you're organized and have a good routine you don't need it a pointless novelty at best
__label__3 the tasks may go missing
__label__3 the app is great but i really don't like new dark styles with orange details color please add the ability to change details color back to blue or some others
__label__5 this is a perfect app solution for as a hybrid between digital and paper calendars i love the extras to make is like my paper calendar in visual effects i also enjoy the ability to combine multiple digital calendars into one this is perfect
__label__3 okay i guess very happy with dev response to my previous review ty
__label__2 good app missing vital a feature it shows meetings not being attended i e going no that is an obvious feature that stops me from giving a good rating i must keep company meetings in the calendar that i'm not attending for posterity not unreasonable i think so this is a must
__label__4 great app except for one huge issue you cannot customize the snooze time you can only snooze up to an hour in specified increments fix this issue and the app would be nearly perfect
__label__2 how to use this app very bad experience please simplify the process nobody wants to take a extra tutorials to use your app to plan our day
__label__1 nothing work i have my calendar prepared for months and nothing come inside the sectograph even i added new one nothing appeared
__label__1 not advisable to anyone
__label__2 it just keep on showing only one event whereas there are more than one events
__label__3 i love this would be 5 stars but i have a few complaints first off i like that it syncs with google calendar i wish that it would sync with svoice too that away i can see my tasks list and notes for the day using svoice also it would be nice if i dont complete a task for that day that instead of having to delete it i could move it to another day those would be some great features thanks
__label__4 great app only complaint is that i'd like the amoled dark mode in the app to match the widget
__label__3 average app no worth
__label__5 amazing planner i've been using the desktop version linked with my google calendar and it was working great now with the app it's even better than i thought it would be i love having all of my appointments in one place and it's so easy to use i especially enjoy the extra feature of being able to add notes to my tasks it has helped me stay on task with work cleaning and everything else
__label__3 was nice using the app getting used to the interface
__label__4 my favorite aspect of this app is the visual organization of my daily events it's a great little widget for people who need to keep track of their life but literally always forget to open the calendar app i would like to see more color custom options
__label__5 by far the most streamlined and easy way to keep my tasks organized and clean all in one place i love the compatibility with google calendar it's so simple and not as complicated as some other reminder apps it just works
__label__4 beautiful
__label__4 this app has really helped me work on some habits i appreciate that it reminded me if i didn't enter information for a day i would have liked features like setting a time for those messages or cool sounds when i click that i've done something but for a free app this was good enough as it was
__label__4 it is good i like being able to add sub task lists for each task and categorise each i would really like if there was a pre made to do today tasks i want to focus on category that one comes up as soon as you open the app like a front page visible calendar 30 day layout one can schedule tasks to making it easier to plan out tasks systemically
__label__2 serviceable but not awesome by any means i've spent enough time trying to set up tasks in here that i feel like i can't bail even though i don't love it it's really tricky to figure out how to make tasks show up like i want and have only been able to really get things set up right by using the website in addition to the app nothing is intuitive or easy to figure out in this app
__label__1 one of the worst in the genre
__label__1 for years i use ticktick i love it so much i rated it 5 in play store but the recent several changes to the app are make the app getting worse and keep getting worse than before i incredibly sad and disappointed for years i rely on ticktick as my todolist app and now i have to find other alternative that can be as good as ticktick that i know before that's not an easy thing to do
__label__2 you basically can't do anything if you don't buy the full version
__label__3 not as good as wünderlist sadly
__label__5 i love this app i use it to gamify truly boring things like uploading my business receipts and putting dishes in the actual dishwasher vs the entire house
__label__3 it replaced wunderlist but actually the functionality was down graded sharing is done with a link instead of directly with a contact
__label__4 all to do lists should embrace habit monitoring also i like it when a pending task persists on the list until it's done or removed
__label__4 edit the 2 tap reminder set is back upgraded back to 4 stars
__label__4 i'm using the premium version a few days now i'm not getting any notifications for my reminders i checked the menu and everything is fine is there something you can do to help
__label__4 love it it works i would like to have had it transfer my habits to the new phone but the backup folder didn't work so i had to do them all over again overall love it though
__label__1 it slow down my flow when i turned on or click via home page widget there is a fade in effect or lagging please kindly help check thank you
__label__2 i really like how amazing it is on my phone but i'm so disappointed to see that it can't be downloaded or visualized on my new galaxy active watch
__label__4 i started using this app in 11th std i'm getting its benifit but the only thing is that it doesnt shows the tasks we have to complete in some monutes or if two tasks are to be completed simultaneously in a hour so i humbly request to make some more changes in this app so that everyone can use it more comfortably
__label__1 broken from the start can't do anything
__label__3 i have been using the app for some time i guess about 2 years the functionality is very good but here comes the tracker list adcolony applovin chartboost facebook ads flurry fyber google analytics inmobi ironsource mintegral moat tapjoy unity3s ads appgenix says only for the free version check with wireshark in progress
__label__4 i think it's really helpful but i want some more functions however i still dont know what exactly they will be make me surprised
__label__3 first i was using this app but when i downloaded it after a long time then strange problems occured such as the routines remainder are not coming although it's option is on also when i login back then a caption stating no authorisation provided to app is flashed please tell me how to resolve it
__label__1 doesn't sync
__label__2 some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing the options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date project category etc these have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps there is no sorting options or filters on views ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful too many clicks to edit tasks eg notes comments rescheduling
__label__5 tv
__label__1 in order to actually use the app as a planner you have to pay money very misleading and dissapointing
__label__4 extremely helpful app helps me be very organized i used to make paper lists but i would lose them this allows me to keep my to do lists in one place and is very easy to add tasks i would like to see a feature where you can populate it daily weekly monthly ex morning routine daily vacuum weekly mail out the electric bill monthly
"__label__3 loved the app but at some point it stopped letting me look at my tasks 
without instantly crashing so i'm not using it anymore i'll be sure to try 
it again and recommend it to friends if the issue isn't present next time"
__label__2 skips reminders until i pick up and check my phone then they go off
__label__3 looks good but doesn't have web version would be 5 stars if i was rating author's dedication functionality wise can't give more than 3 the app is inferior to any do or microsofts todo
__label__4 тарас это крутая идея и хорошая реализация доставляет кайф возможность разбивать дэйлики на подпункты будет чётко если добавишь возможность автозавершения после выполнения всех пунктов система ачивок вполне юзабельно но нужно устанавливать ачивки на habit generate по типу 30 дней без перерыва и при желании по возрастающей 3 месяца и т д nexus 5x lineages os 15 1 не работают reminders не готов брать подписку но если добавишь отдельный платный контент иконки или журнал квестов куплю
__label__3 nice
__label__2 not really interesting doesn't help if you don't have a discipline already in place
__label__5 excellent service
__label__4 doesn't really sync with my calendar as events are added edit user error with delay in google calendar
__label__4 i love this app alot theres just two things i would really love to see added it would be great if you allowed us to choose to have a habit set up for like 3 times out of the week without picking which days of the week i also really wish i could have more than 4 habits is there a way to do that it's a great app thanks so much
__label__3 this app works nice if you want to track daily or weekly tasks but it was impossible for me to schedule tasks that should happen at a certain interval for example every two weeks or every 5th of the month there is the option to schedule a task a certain amount of times per month but not to set specific intervals or dates for such occurrences this was unfortunately a dealbreaker
__label__2 its good for making lists but if you want reminders or other features you need to upgrade to premium its just not for me
__label__4 a very good rip off of liferpg taking all of the useful features of task management reward motivation and rpg style stat levels and making the ui simpler and more user friendly seems to be monetizing the idea though putting in ads and lots of in app purchases and requiring a recurring payment subscription rather than one time purchase to unlock features
__label__4 i like this app enough to have paid for a year's subscription but there are a couple quality of life improvements that would be nice i would love to see icons on the widget i would also like to pick icons as my avatar photo since there's some good ones
__label__5 if you are looking for a perfect organiser of your time this is the app for you love it and you will too if you are like me and want some organisation in your life perfect
__label__1 uninstalled once i realized there are ads and it wipes your current google calendar
__label__4 it's useful simple to use have lot of features but not complicated and disturbing maybe it's not number 1 but i'm sure it's one the best apps
__label__5 perfect
__label__2 i really like how amazing it is on my phone but i'm so disappointed to see that it can't be downloaded or visualized on my new galaxy active watch
__label__5 keeps you on track
__label__4 i love this app only thing that annoys me is how marking a task as complete in one device doesn't dismiss notifications on the others
__label__4 need compatible with apple for 5 star
__label__3 i like the idea how it shows my skills but i hate it when it organize the tasks in orders it sets up automatically wherever it wants manual task organizer should be available
__label__1 the app is not opening and displays message unfortunately forest has stopped working
__label__3 i would give this 5 stars if not for the misleading in app smartwatch settings extension purchase option i love the app but i purchased the extension to use it on my galaxy watch and i have been unable to connect it to my watch and use any of the settings for a wearable if this app can be used on the galaxy smartwatches i would love to know how
__label__5 it is really good and dies not have any ads also is really good for when tidying up
__label__5 good reminder app fir personal and professional use i used the free version and am happy with it takes a couple if days to get used to although the ui is quite simple
__label__4 hello your app is amazing my gf and me installed this app 2 days ago and started to planning task to each other but i really need a list functional like add a shopping list or some book list to add in this app are you going to add this sry for my english btw update and i really need a functional to add a checklist in tasks with possibility to mark it's completed thank you and your team again for this great app
__label__1 i was trying out to any do free version i had spent quite a bit of time making lists and suddenly one day they were entirely inaccessible look like they let me put in a lot of dataand then after a certain point decide to hold that data the hostage until i paid them i decided to not use any do because after i pay them and started making more list would they suddenly didn't demand that i paid them more per month in order to access all the information i had taking the time to put in
__label__2 it dont have alarm feature
__label__4 organized app
__label__2 yeah this is not user friendly there should be some kind of tutorial this is not the kind of app you can just jump in and start using which is what i was hoping for
__label__1 infested with ads now downloaded to specifically view one calendar and set it so but it automatically syncs my samsung and gmail calendars automatically every time i open it
__label__4 i wish there was an overnight option i would also like if there was something to grow on a larger scale like wonders of the world from sleepy town except it would be geared towards nature like growing the savannah or a swamp or a rainforest i think it gets old too quickly okay i grew four trees these past two hours again i think it could be bigger and better give me some themes give me a world to build
__label__5 overall it is a great app but i need to open the app everytime i need to check something i hope this app makes a widget to fit in the home screen
__label__5 a great no charge organizer
__label__3 how different it is from google calendar your idea is good and interesting i am a knd of person who try following this
__label__1 i have not installed it not sure if it was somehow installed by hacking
__label__1 from the terrible microsoft design to the fact of missing crucial features especially in comparison to wunderlist and the fact that microsoft only bought wunderlist to shut it down this piece of software actually had to overwhelm people to overcome the unfriendly microsoft strategy but here we are letting us all down go to ticktick or smth else microsoft does not deserve our attention on this one
__label__2 app is very good for what it is but the sync feature stopped working for me the faq says it's due to a rooted phone but this happened twice on non rooted phones habitbull offers no support to fix 2 stars bec it works standalone but if you need syncing know there's a risk of permanent failure
__label__3 a little shy on functionality but for the price it can't be beat i use it daily
__label__3 i do enjoy this app but it looks and functions terribly on anything but a mobile aspect ratio i'm attempting to use this for chromeos on a pixelbook but the app is unable to run in windowed mode or resize in landscape mode properly i am also a pro user but the app lacks pro functions there is no pause feature to be found on either the android or chrome extension and deleting records costs an additional 60 coins
__label__1 the is no default free tree there are trees for tokens but you gain tokens by succesfully growing trees but you can only have an initial growable tree by buying one
__label__3 i like this app always wanted a planner only problem is when i try to click on the tabs on the side its very sensitive takes me forever to click it it disappears
__label__3 not going to pay 3 99 for premium or whatever it is to have more than 5 habits tracked ill use you a pen and pad no problem
__label__4 beautiful design but i'd prefer a one time charge option for the pro version
__label__3 decent app very helpful to split things up visually but several issues over the past few months of usage tasks suddenly stop syncing up from a desktop pc to the app deletion of lists seem to work but then the lists re appear and most recently all the tasks that have been completed over a period of time are suddenly back in my list on a basic level this app is useful for anything more than that it's not the solution i was hoping for i am a little ocd but if you are too then look elsewhere
__label__3 love the app but it's almost useless on my galaxy view because the app switches back to portrait mode when adding a task for a tablet that sits stationary in landscape mode it just doesn't work love the app on my phone and the website is nice too
__label__3 it has a nice pop up widget for your to do list the problem with this app is when i want it to alert me always at 9 about it or remind me of my tasks it doesn't its just there i'm still using it but i feel google assistant does a better job of reminding me so i might delete it later not so satisfying
__label__3 great app
__label__3 ok its useful
__label__3 this planner app is pretty clear and simple i have the paid version and it works ok except today they had a glitch and i lost everything even when i reinstalled it was just so screwed up so if you don't mind losing all of your work when they update i guess it's survivable
__label__5 it's very good
"__label__5 this calendar is lovely to use minimalist asthetically pleasing and 
exactly the functions and view options i was looking for love it"
__label__3 sorry this is not a review but a question anything i enter in google calendar ends up in any do but not the other way around how do i do this have i missed something specifically i want my goggle home mini to be able to tell me what's on my any do tasks and calendars
__label__3 pro the functionality and ui are one of the best of these kinds of apps everything has a simple look to it but you can always go deep add a reminder here a folder there and do exactly what you want it to do con the feature i want the most more than 5 repeatable tasks habits is locked behind a subscription paywall and there is no reason for a subscription model i'd gladly drop a reasonable one time payment for it but not the asking price month after month i'm not rich and nether is my country all in all great if you can afford it frustratingly limited if you can't
__label__4 this is a nice app it does what i needed to do and it's there when i need to use it
__label__3 for 24 hour version need to buy app no free trials
__label__5 great since i always forget everything i highly recommend the premium it makes my life so much easier im sure it would make yours easier too
__label__2 1 create 80 000 events to several exchange calendars 2 sync it with bc 2 mobile app 3 and you will see how perfect bc2 works all the time anr thank you
__label__1 i used to love this calendar but now it has full screen ads videos that take over your phone can't do anything else while the pop up ad is running first one of these i saw uninstalled response the ads definitely come up more than twice per day and the calendar is definitely not functional while the ads are running you must wait for the commercial to end before you can open the calendar again i can understand bar ads at the top or bottom of a free app but full length commercials
__label__3 works well and syncs well with the chosen calenders
__label__3 great to do list the only issue is location based reminders seem to be sporadic also annoying that you can't set all day tasks hopefully an update soon no resolution and tech support slow a shame
__label__1 beware the trial period is a scam i've been using the free version for a while and decided to try the premium for 7 days per the trial ad after 5 days i realized it didn't quite organize my information how i best work so i wrote to cancel they informed me that i must have accidentally signed up for a non trial and by their strict terms cannot refund me so i wrote back nicely that my intention was to try it per the ad but they said it's not possible really
__label__3 i don't know if a google update has rendered this app useless for reminders but i no longer get reminders for important events i now have to go into the calendar app itself to view what is coming up i'm sick of apologising to people for missed appointments i use a note 4
__label__1 cannot access the app
__label__3 notifications do not show up thought i have enabled all permissions and to override dnd the notifications and reminders do not work
__label__4 great app ideal for planning ur day nice premium subscription
__label__1 requires being online to use which is a shame because it looks like a fun way to get motivated would use if it didn't require constant network or wifi connection i live and work in rural areas had to uninstall due to inability to use throughout the day
__label__5 the app i was using before was closing and changing into something else so i did some research and this was very popular rightly so as i prefer it to what i was using before great app
__label__1 i'm not going to even explain why one star
__label__3 needed sync tasks color code events and for goodness' sake speed up this is extremely slow
__label__3 nice app it's just i feel their is always space for improvement
__label__4 moving from the wonderful wunderlist to to do app was easy and now some other feature are added among which i like add to my day and tasks
__label__3 how do you email your tasks on it how do you sync it with the google calendar
__label__3 please at least put an option to use the previous theme i like the previous one with flat design minimalist if you could also put a feature to have other place a comment on our list that would be great kindly prioritize the option to use the minimalist flat design theme it is less distracting which makes me more productive i recommended this to my friends because of its design good thing my other device is not set to auto update i was able to retain the previous version
__label__2 please update the app i want to use the app but after a day alarm is not ringing i think this app have too much bugs and problems
__label__3 the new update remove the option to change only one event when it is on repeat now i need to copy and select and could have more colors paid version
__label__5 i can see my day at a glance with out screen beign cluttered
__label__4 greatly improved comment from me much better than a year ago most updated lead to improvement wish the ' want an annual subscription
__label__3 be nice to see all tasks by day instead of just 7 days out
__label__1 wunderlist is the best for me if you would like to change wunderlist to be microsoft to do please take all wunderlist's features in this app you don't take 3 features that important things for me 1 login using un microsoft account 2 all task menu 3 comment feature on each list this point so make me happy it used for list that i shared with another person and want to share the actual condition with a comment please enhance this app and i will change my rate to 5 star thank you
__label__1 nothing but connection error after connection error the concept is great but i can't even manage to use the service because any time i try to do anything that's all i'm getting
__label__3 great app gives me the motivation to do the work and have a little garden of my own but lately it doesnt want to start crashes as soon as i click on it please do something
__label__4 it's a good assistant for daily life but i don't like that in there's a premium upgrade for money
__label__1 worst app ever because there is no reminder bell things i think there is but it doesn't work i can't even remember that i have this app with reminder thing will be better i spent two hours to write my routine plan and i thought there is reminder it's not easy to use this app too i am deleting this useless app immediately alarm doesn't work at all how disappointing
__label__1 doesn't sync anymore i paid for the pro version
__label__4 complete a tip the task option directly reduces the characteristics rather than just the ability
__label__2 now when i get a reminder it wakes up the screen to display the notification there's no way to change this edit reminder pop ups is already switch off
__label__3 how to name the tree that ive plant
__label__3 gud way to keep in track of our habits
__label__4 the best app for to do lists it does have a couple of minor issues the widget can become unusable once in a while stuck forever on the loading screen it can also take a couple of seconds for an item to be removed after you check it off on the widget
__label__1 switched from wunderlist and the widget will occasionally not load the contents sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't very frustrating to use wunderlist never had any of these problems
__label__4 a good app if you know exactly what you want you'll need this app to get started but a lot of us don't know what we want to do we don't have a lifestyle coach to tell us how to improve our habits or how to be productive we seek it out in the charming articles on the internet so maybe populate the internet with this app's usability behind a healthy productive living theme idk just saying
__label__3 it's a good start i currently have a 1 month subscription needs more habit type features needs to track display and keep a record of current and longest streaks repeat option needs much more options like 1 a way to track a task that's done a certain number of times a day like 3 times a day 2 repeat week should also have the option to have the task done a certain amount of days not just on specific days 3 achievements should have an option for completing consecutive days
__label__3 just tested the pro version needs to be more stable sometimes my work starts at 12 am and it doesn't sync with my google calendar widget needs to be fine tuned not quite satisfied so 3 stars
__label__4 really nice app that is easy to use would be cool to see a feature where you can build things like building a village and materials for this are acquired through completing tasks habits
__label__1 you get one star because i don't like being constantly harassed with popups asking me to rate it in an app i am paying for stop forcing automatic correction this is changing what i am typing and changes my formating make this an option to turn off
__label__3 i really like this however i'm not able to stay with it for long periods of time this one and others i've tried and i just can't stay motivated
__label__3 its not a bad app at all but it could be better if you could keep track of how often you complete a task that would be better like if you checked off every time you shampooed your hair it would be nice to keep track so you can change how much you shampoo if needed also i feel like having a bar at the top to switch between lists makes more sense than the way it is now you should still give it a try if you need something like this because you might like it better than i did
__label__2 the app won't open anymore and before that i couldn't log into my account pls sort out one suggestion i would like to make is the option to arrange the trees and bushes the way we want it's a good app just struggling to get it to work
__label__1 when opening a sub task from any view the sub task window does not even show the main list task it is from
__label__2 office 365 integration doesn't work so it's basically useless as a business calendar as a private calendar i don't see any big improvement over google calendar but it's not worse either
__label__2 only 5 items on free version would be nice to have that clear so i don't have to waste my time and give out my email
__label__1 was really enjoying this then the notifications just stopped which is a big part of what i needed the app for annoying finding a new app for this now
__label__5 great application to organize a schedule especially procrastinators
__label__2 would be better if the inbox was not treated as a project but rather a scheduling location and that items could be created in the inbox and easily bulk moved to other projects but stay in the inbox to then be scheduled to daily or next week or whatever tracking would be easier and the app would get a higher rating and i may actually subscribe its a deal breaker for me
__label__1 how do i get a refund
__label__3 i love this app and use it with my watch but have been having a few problems firstly i purchased the pro version off of my main google account but the app is connecting to the other google account i have on my phone i dont want to purchase pro a second time and the only way that i have found to disconnect it from that second account is by removing that account from my phone secondly since daylight saving my events have been an hour off until i sync my events will change if probs are fixed
__label__1 one of the best apps i ever liked but i can't control my anger right now if there is a limitation of 5 real trees then why didn't you mention it on purchase page why nowhere you have mentioned that we can plant only 5 trees maximum if you are going to plant only 5 trees with the money we paid cant we use the same money to plant 5 in my neighbourhood worst app ever now false marketing by hiding about 5 tree limit update i understand but mention about the 5 tree limit on purchase page
__label__3 the app is ok it could be simpler to work i had to fiddle around a bit and some persons may not have the patience to do so
__label__5 amazing app perfect blend of features and polish one thing i gotta appreciate is that even to new users who haven't decided on subscription yet it's so clean no in the face buy me messages it's so clean and polite the subscription is totally worth it since it really does offer that much love it kudos to the team and community for making it what it is
__label__5 great
__label__3 it alright
__label__5 very awesome so far i really love how customizable this is it does so much it takes a while to learn how to utilize all the features but i am super happy hope it continues to be great with continued use
__label__3 great app but crazy there's no google calendar integration even tried setting this up with zapier but it only creates an entry with no link to any do task title for when the task is created and not when the task is scheduled will google calendar integration be coming to the app
__label__3 i purchased the pro version inside this app why can't i download the pro app in google store
__label__1 this is such a fantastic app but the time taken to solve out problem that i'm facing for last 10 15 days is leaving the counter effect instead of being focused i'm more distracted because i am unable to plant any tree and it crashes my phone every now and then reported so many times and uploaded every data they asked for but in vain 1 star is for that i purchased premium and now i've to go through all this
__label__4 nice app super helpful to plan anything recommend it however it would be nice if you could at a to do list function that way i could tick off the things i need to complete for one time only such as homework good work tho
__label__3 it's actually good but it doesn't have a feature where your task appears on your lockscreen that will remind you everytime you forgot something to do
__label__1 the app suddenly stops working on my phone
__label__5 ok i love the app it's great but the notifications just doesn't work they are broken and it's the main feature i'm looking for fix it in order to give you the five starts
__label__2 i like the app but for the past day i haven't got any notifications
__label__5 great for setting daily habits tasks and ads your google calendar events into the timeline
__label__1 i've used this calendar for years it has always been the best but now they've added ads unless those go away i'll be finding a new calendar
__label__4 this app is great overall i just wish there were categories for your inventory items and that the task list widget showed your profile icon also the profile icon has very bad quality when you choose your own
__label__3 give me the best observation time
__label__2 why does the app keep showing server connection lost even though there is no problem with my network or internet server i can't open the app and refresh it at all
__label__3 seems legit but i don't know i don't use it
__label__4 this app is just great it not only reminds me what i need to do it really motivates me to do stuff the only problem i'm facing whenever i try to mark a task as completed the task crashes and then it updates and actually shown as completed except this annoying bug i love it
__label__5 perfect overview of your day and what to come
__label__2 the app works great with wifi i love the feel of the app and desktop versions but a decent chunk of my day is spent with limited no wifi i can't recommend it for that
__label__4 wish it supported sharing but otherwise a fantastic simple to do list app
__label__3 seems like a good idea but the widget is invisible it is there i can see the edges when i try to move it but it's completely invisible i tried decreasing the widget transparency and deleting cache but to no avail devs any clues thank you
__label__2 i immediately encountered a problem when i began by misclicking on one of my habits there's no way to correct for that manually change the values yes but the xp and hp don't change to reflect that automatically secondly the settings page is broken on my s9 and the issue is difficult to describe the display freezes so if you scroll an instance of the text moves while the another is stuck below honestly the tutorial really needs work i could go on but space constraints
__label__3
__label__3 true a unsnecessarypts at r
__label__4 cool app can almost replace the other widgets i have on my home screen but missing one feature which is not the fault of the app but a shortcoming for my particular needs weather include weather and i can easily pay for this app still keeping as it is a good app
__label__3 everything is good but i would like to see more then a five slots for habits
__label__5 very nice app
__label__4 nice app but can update a function such as we can add in an attachment like photo into the task or etc will be better
__label__4 would have given it 5 stars but it doesn't seem to want to rotate when using my tablet
__label__3 really pretty good app but two problems 1 sometimes repeat weekly reminders don't work at all especially if you haven't ticked it the previous week 2 please allow multiple reminders for one event thanks it's really promising and useful otherwise
__label__2 from all possible options i've tried out this has most awkward and unintuitive interface
__label__5 great
__label__2 not so good
__label__3 is good standalone but outlook integration is confusing and ineffective i have to use onenote as my todo at work
__label__1 should have an option to add reminders it only displays events
__label__3 reminders are premium kind of denotes the point of having a to do list
__label__1 would not let me create a log in
__label__3 gave it a chance still quite raw no proper planning and no way to see all tasks at once please take some inspiration from any do win10 store application however is epic the best very bad that there is no tomorrow and incomplete tasks from my day disappear
__label__5 perfect widget for your home screen all your events in the same place on a clock
__label__2 doesn't sync with google calendar the one thing it's supposed to do and it failed
__label__1 i used to like even love this app it was great now though every time i add an event on my calendar an ad comes up and stays there until it is finished it's awful so far the ads have not been inappropriate just annoying i don't think that going to the pro version would fix this i don't even know how to find the pro version to purchase as it doesn't show up in the play store super frustrating i don't want to find another app i just want this one to work without the silly ads
__label__3 i prefer wunderlist since you can move around the tasks but app doesn't allow that flexibility only broad sorting features
__label__2 i cant set my times for events bc theres no am pm option it keeps changing my time not allowing me to put the right thing annoying
__label__1 i'm using one plus 7 android 10 alarm reminder doesn't work at all
__label__1 the app would be nice if it actually gave you a tutorial on how it should be used it seems almost like clickbait with one appealing look and then it's not what you expected or needed yes it's very organized and but nothing is explained
__label__3 i would have loved this app except for the fact that i need to pay to even use it as a widget
__label__3 it's good but everytime i mark a task as completed on the widget i have to open the app and tell it to sort my tasks by date again you guys should include a setting to choose how you want your tasks ordered and reorder them by that setting everytime cause it's annoying having them reorder themselves in a way i dislike constantly
__label__1 app has stopped opening
__label__2 still missing a bunch of essential features like send reminder to all users in a list and recurring reminders for certain time of the day too bad i really enjoyed the ui but those features are a must for me
__label__3 my wedget doesn't update weather help
__label__4 very reliable but not great at retaining future appointments over one year they seem to disappear
__label__3 i like this app but in the world of time schedule management you have to be multi platform i would recommend that your next step in development is a web interface as the majority of a professionals day is spent on a pc or laptop
__label__2 wunderlist was much better more user friendly for example there is no select of tasks due on the week
__label__5 i love habitica it's a habit tracker and to do list that actually motivates me to get things done via the gamification and fun social aspect the world of habitica feels like a supportive community of people holding each other accountable and helping each other accomplish their goals doing my daily chores is so much more fun when i turn it into a quest for magical potions and eggs
__label__5 brilliant app simple to use and does everything i need from a to do list
__label__2 i love this app but recently it has been freezing every time i add a new task it's updated and i even reinstalled it yet it is still happening
__label__5 kpai
__label__3 great but why i'm able to open and prolong operate any app immediately after assigning timer then after using 3 to 4 apps forest gets to know that i'm using other apps and reminds me about my distraction so late please fix this problem otherwise it's a great application for controling phone distraction
__label__3 the app is great except for being internet dependant and lacking an undo button or a button lock for unintended log entries i know there is an edit your character section but there is no record of past entries to use as reference
__label__5 habitica is the best it's so rewarding completing day to day tasks with this app your avatar can earn gold equipment pets experience by completing the tasks you choose joining a questing party is fun because you're with others holding each other accountable and encouraging one another participating in challenges is great because you work on specific aspects of your life like positive thinking exercising reading ect habitica has helped improve my life and i feel so much happier
__label__4 good app wish there were more customization
__label__1 too complicated trying to add items to a list it keeps trying to use the item names instead to make a new list or send the old list to this
__label__4 almost all the functionality of the franklin planner this is a great app
__label__1 are you kidding me i down load a planner callander app i go set it all up and link it and try to see the month so i know it's all right my it says i have to upgrade and pay for a month calender view ok annoying but i try 1 week same thing gotta pay calandar app with only 2 views for oveall use please don't say it's a free app or at least explain can see all these cool features i'll even let you go through and set up but you have to pay for all the feature
__label__1 it looked good but it doesn't work i scheduled simple tasks and it would change the timing i re corrected to make it right several times the navigation was difficult like i'd want to set a task but then i'd have to say the task was complete so wouldn't be sure it saved couldn't just back out to see the task was set correctly had to confirm the task was done then undo the task for later which might then change the time to something i never set
__label__5 an excellent application
__label__5 useful fast and complete with all the essential features of a todo app
__label__4 love the simplicity really works for setting core routines not for every tiny extra thing that you want to add beyond your core routine but great for setting new daily practices and keeping you mindful of over investment in certain tasks and procrastination
__label__4 app is great helps me keep track of my daily habits i like how the interface is simple and easy to use however i've been experiencing issues tracking my habits using the widget
__label__4 interesting concept still getting used to the functionality but this app is an effective way to gamify your to do and task lists before do it now rpg i had a list of chores now i have a quest list instead time to go unlock some achievements
__label__3 i love this app only issue is there is no check mark to check if you completed something of course in a perfect world we get it all done and don't forget but for those not so perfect people i wish there was a way to check off what you finished for the day
__label__1 impossible to use
__label__3 great for daily list used to use the grocery list used to had to turn it off due to spam if it continues i'll uninstall the app update clarify imo spam is getting items added to my grocery list that i don't want never buy it was the app telling me we've added xyz to your grocery list
__label__1 has so many bugs it's keep crashing
__label__5 this app is beautiful and has really helped me keep my business large family homeschool and church activities all in order no more chaos for this girl
__label__5 i never thought i could switch to a digital planner and yet here i am my husband is so happy to see everything that used to take him time sifting through my calendar we're all synced up on google calendar now and i have the beautiful version for me to see on artful agenda with the lists i need to run my box and family
__label__3 whilst most of he functionality is there i preferred the look and feel of wunderlist much more
__label__4 good simple app that works well it keeps my to do list synced between my android phone and web browser on my computer
__label__5 excellent app have it synced with about 8 calendars so i can get everything in one place it works i wish everything in the app world worked so well
__label__3 i've used todoist for years and it's a fantastic app but i won't give it more stars unless they show sub projects under the parent project again like it is on desktop edit i added one more star for having configurable swipe settings which i really appreciate this feature allows you to replace swipe to right to select with done which is far more useful
__label__3 experiência muito boa mas tem muito a ser feito
"__label__3 i would like it better if you could add days of the week that would be 
super helpful for example i only workout monday thru friday so if i could 
have it remind me monday thru friday that would be super helpful"
__label__5 using the free version and already i am hooked with how great it is
__label__3 i love lists and i really love this easy to use app however i also love making notes to myself of a lengthy nature usually when i'm trying to go to sleep like my thoughts on a subject or what id like to talk about to a friend it would be amazing if there was a blank note page or lined page without all the frills of dates and times and priority and complete to compete with my eyes i dislike having to have multiple apps for same basic function i'd chose this over all others
__label__3 i have appointments on the internal calendar that don't show on here this includes new ones and ones i made months ago no point in using this if i have to check another app to find all of my appointments
__label__1 does not work properly does not update wit hcalendar entries worst thing cannot aak my money back
__label__4 the app looks and feels good but it just doesn't work for me i wanted this app mainly for the widget but it is almost useless when you cross of an item it doesn't show up in the widget and when you edit the list in app it doesn't update on the widget according to the dev it's xiaomi's fault which i think is a possibility so be aware of this when you download it
__label__3 lobe this app but the only thing that is stopping me from getting premium is that i am unable to arrange the habits in order habits are also not arranged according to time and it makes it so hard to find them if you do fix it i will purchase this app
__label__3 if time tracking was added and the parser interface of the what would you like to do field was fixed this alone is making me want to switch back to amazing marvin i would rate 5 stars
__label__3 everything is good my only issue is that it doesn't send the message to you the exact moment you assigned it eg i set a reminder at 8pm the bot only whatsapped me 15mins later other than this everything else is good love the feature of a whatsapp reminder bot improve on this area and you'll earn 1 more loyal customer
__label__3 i like it so far
__label__2 syncing with alexa takes over 10 15 minutes which renders it unusable any do before you post your generic response yes i added the skill to my alexa and yes i logged into my accounts it syncs kind of so i can verify the two accounts are talking just not well at all when i use wunderlist or google tasks or just alexa by itself the changes are instantly viewable across all platforms the only reason i downloaded with app was to give me more control over my alexa lists which for some insane reason you cannot reorder the extremely lag in syncing any do with alexa renders this app useless the ui looks really nice and user friendly so i bumped it up to 2 stars
__label__3 great app
__label__4 i would really love to see a pomodoro timer habit tracker and a kanban board the subtasks management could be better as it is in ticktick i really love how todoist have 2 way google calendar sync
__label__3 it would be great if the notifications actually works i don't get notified by any task i put in at all
__label__2 would not load
"__label__3 i switched from loop to this app because it supports cloud sync 
unfortunately for some reason battery drain is excessive 24 on a mi a1 
using android 8 0"
__label__2 the widget has been broken for the last couple of weeks since an update please fix it
__label__2 passcode feature is messed up and locked me out had to uninstall yr
__label__1 despite working fine with the web version of the app this android version of ticktick throws a validation error on my email address when i try to sign in because according to carol a dev of the ticktick team with whom i spoke about this on their help forum my email address features hyphens tf since when are hyphens in address so uncommon that they're not worth supporting terrible imo ux both in app and for customer service
__label__5 helpful app
__label__3 dark mode done but why on earth in 2020 i still can't rearrange my sticky notes
__label__1 i've used this app for years and have loved it up until now now i get full page ads that sit there for 5 seconds and disrupt what i'm doing i don't mind a full page ad that i can back out of or scrolling ads at the bottom but to force me to watch a 5 second ad is not reasonable seems like they're forcing you to pay up or move on to another app if this continues i'll find another app
__label__3 edit reverted to old version or something and issues are back edit issue fixed and new update is great seems like you actually passed the issue along instead of making complaining subscriber have to repeat the complaint in email huge fan of habitica used it for years it was called habitrpg when i started only to do list app i have stuck to encourages you to build good habits in a fun way community built no ads worth subscribing to support the app
__label__5 after trying about 6 other similar apps i bought this one again had it for iphone now on android i like the option to prioritize my tasks
__label__4 i think that feature of changing theme should be addef and apart from that there should also be a option for showing task on thr facr of calender itselg
__label__2 i buy the platinum app but the reminders doesn't work please fix it it's a great app but the reminders are very important to me
__label__1 wants 2 99 per month to do things i can do for free with google
__label__1 you should probably let us view our monthly and yearly progress without premium
__label__4 very good app simple to use
__label__1 recent addition of very intrusive full screen video ads has crossed a line at first i thought my phone had been hacked i totally understand need for revenue for a great free app but this is too much i'm going elsewhere very soon without a change
__label__3 why aren't holidays showing up on my calendar
__label__4 very good just one point when listing coming up tasks it would be good to have bands of background semi transparent color to highlight today's events and next 3 days events for example to be distinguished from far future events all in one list with no distinction tends to be overlooked
__label__2 not as good as wunderlist supposed to verify before deleting but it doesn't lost entire list by accidentally touching and yes i have it turned on in settings at least with wunderlist you could see deleted items and undo going to find something better than this then uninstalling
__label__3 i love the idea of this app but it seems to have issues syncing i have the app integrated with my office 365 account and have it installed on my desktop as well when i update tasks on my phone app it doesn't consistantly sync to office same thing for my desktop app i end up having to adjust each platform separately not smart at all
__label__4 i'm coming from wunderlist and i feel quite comfortable with the feel of the app except that i miss the main view of one selected list's tems it'll be cool if you added an alternative to the home view
__label__4 hi can i have an option to choose between the new and old designs of the widget the previous version was able to have larger boxes to fit long description tasks while the new one just puts three dots and shortens the task descriptions to fit in one fixed width which disables full reading of the task bad also subtasks cannot be seen without clicking the main task which kinda defeats the purpose again of having a todoist widget where i should be seeing the overview of everything thanks
__label__3 i do have a few problems but the app is fairly easy and i can keep up with everything quite well
__label__3 small but significant issue for me i like to look ahead at the events and tasks or whatever i put into the calendar widget in advance but i wish there was a way to automatically go back like a button to today's date and events afterwards because i don't like having to manually click on the arrows to go back to today's date after i view my future months and events overall awesome app hopefully something like this gets added i really want to continue using this app thank you
__label__1 worst app
__label__4 please solve the problem with fast typing after i type in the date letters and numbers remain
__label__2 doesn't sync to my smartwatch
__label__4 my mother was saying your maximum time limit was two hours with the phone but i always did more this app allowed me to stay focused on something else really recommend it
__label__4 great app has a few bugs merging calanders and loosing input but otherwise excellent
__label__4 i really like this application it's super simple two things i want schedule upcoming tasks in my calendar and do meal planning as well in it
__label__3 it is useful but very user friendly
__label__1 this app is useless it works as a notepad with your tasks in it it does not notify you of tasks you suppose to do when the time reaches it's silent doesn't pop up even though settings have permitted it to pop up and alert even a simple alarm clock notified me of what to do this app doesn't work
__label__3 i think that this is a great idea but it s one better suited for a larger screen a lot of display real estate is utilized to beautifully display a very limited amount of information
__label__5 i have never seen a more beautifully designed calendar planner app easy on eyes strikes a great balance between functionality and simplicity google and microsoft calendar apps should take inspiration from this and just great when i start earning i'm definitely going to buy this app just to show gratitude
__label__5 i use this app as a recommendation from some writer in medium i've been using for a month and it's amazing i can plan and complete all my tasks
__label__1 why tick tick for windows is available for 15 days we can use free version of tick tick on android but on windows there is time period you should allow to use free version of tick tick on windows also without 15 days trial really bad experience with tick tick
__label__4 great app so far very user friendly would love an option to duplicate a hole list found an option to duplicate sub list only thanks
__label__4 can you please add the ability to hear a sample of the audio themes before you select them i tried another popular rpg checklist app and i didnt like it as much this app for me has been life changing literally its a great app for breaking bad habits building up good habits or having a videogame style quest checklist that gives you instant gratification for completing real world tasks theres some occasional glitches but nothing major they can be fixed by closing the app and restarting it
__label__5 fantastic absolutely best of it's kind no ads great system of to dos dailies and habits that you want to have and break plus the tavern guild challenge quest party system really keeps you motivated as does the in art or out of world reward system absolutely fantastic
__label__4 easy to use but it seems really basic
__label__3 i've only had this app for about a week but so far so good no ads as yet very easy to use
__label__2 the dailies and habits should reset everyday please let them reset
__label__5 simple best and optimum the best to do list notifier and noting app
__label__3 if you can't add subtasks everything else in the app is quite impressive except this i added a project and it disappeared from my projects tab and i couldn't add any subtasks to it so it is indistinguishable from a regular task
__label__4 great at 1st
__label__1 muito bom
__label__4 no bad habits to simply punish me just could make good habits
__label__3 things to do add a move task icon to the single selection toolbar it's currently in the menu annoying use the de facto android standard for multiple selection the long press gosh other than that 3 stars for the occasional bugs tasks are often slow to move as in i move a task then after 2s it goes back then moves again making it a mess tasks got sometimes lost in other subtasks because the drag and drop gesture is clumsy
__label__3 pomo timer is still glitchy
__label__2 its ok
__label__5 perfect app its make not depress
__label__2 tutorial did not explain much and too confusing to figure out the benefit of using this app
__label__1 app became unusable with 11 06 18 update now the app takes 30 45 to open up after i click it and then i'm get an annoying ad that plays that i can't close for another 5 10 seconds i'll be finding a new calendar app
__label__2 beautiful interface and design unfortunately most features are locked behind a subscription including some important features such as viewing completed daily tasks as is other top rated to do apps offer more features for absolutely no cost would consider paying a one time fee for it but the subscription is a deal breaker
__label__1 used to be 5 stars i've used this app for years the sudden addition of full page unskipable adds ruined it it looks like i'm not alone in my disappointment
__label__5 this app is awesome makes tasks fun
__label__1 this app would not let me start a new day it listed my tasks that i performed for one day as overdue for the next day just weird
"__label__3 pretty buggy still love habitica and really wish the app wasn't so painful 
to use many times the bottom half of the screen becomes numb to taps 
marking many teams done usually fails and means you have to unmark and then 
mark again some real polish is sorely needed"
__label__5 the best yet
__label__2 two bugs right at the beginning of registration first two images didn't load on the three slides intro then when registering my info it moved to the next screen but gave a name error and i couldn't make an avatar not a good first impression just deleted my account thru the website
__label__3 i like this app but the ads are getting aggravating especially the trump ads i'd prefer not to see him on my phone thank you very much
__label__4 great app the best time setting interface of anything only feature i don't like is if you change the start time of an event it proportionally changes the end time so you have to change the end back to where it was and if you change it enough to span the midnight hour now you have to change the days too
__label__2 now when i get a reminder it wakes up the screen to display the notification there's no way to change this edit reminder pop ups is already switch off
__label__3 like
__label__3 i like the app but why a habit is limited to once a day there's no habit twice a day or more i can't understand
__label__3 how to view statistics
__label__2 the app doesn't sync after making changes on my google calendar even after hitting the sync now on the app
__label__4 great app keeps me on track and efficient helps me stick to my new year's goals just wish we could add more habits
__label__2 i like the concept but the execution needs work in my experience the app was laggy non responsive at times which made the experience of creating and managing tasks tedious
__label__1 garbage the one time i can't remember if i checked the notification for taking my medication or not there was no way to go and see which days i checked it or not what's the point of that
__label__4 works well
__label__5 outstanding best to do list app i've ever used and i've tried a lot of them worth every penny
__label__3 great concept unfortunately sometimes a bit buggy implementation really weird back stack handling and syncs don't work quite often staying with it for now hoping on things to be fixed in the future
__label__5 great app it really helped me to be productive throughout the day
__label__5 no words this app is fantastic i keep my focus a lot more when i do my homework
__label__5 solid to do list app with very nice features such as karma points and 7 days ahead the best app in my opinion
__label__3 was great but the last update stop synking the outlook account try to re connect it but no luck
__label__1 worst
__label__2 the idea behind the app is nice but it isn't userfriendly finding and adding friends to use it together was so counter productive that it got us to waste time we could be actually doing our daily tasks
__label__2 it is not what i want
__label__3 okay but i wish it had options to increase exp and stays for example when you read a book gain x intuition when you run x times you gain x stamina etc etc and get rewards and level that way gives more motivation for doing those things
__label__3 this is so complicated it took me awhile to to figure all the stuff i would suggest add some tutorial on youtube so anyone can get used to it and the app is solid and will think about purchasing the pro version
__label__1 no good
__label__4 awesome app it helps me a lot to organize my life work and other stuffs the features are really amazing would recommend this to my friends and colleagues
__label__3 used it for 1 day then forgot to even open it as got into new habit it kept showing notifications and i kept ignoring it not much productive for me but app design is good
__label__4 loving this app so far my only concern is that it does not highlight the current date on the calender when i open the app if there are no tasks events for that day this can be confusing another concern is that the calender does not indicate whether there are tasks events for particular days by showing tiny dots next to the date
__label__3 i have the premium version i had been using wunderlist the most amazing todo app ever and very intuitive tick tick has worked well as wunderlist is no longer supported however some key things i truly miss push notifications when someone texts within the app notification that someone else has updated or completed a task or list copy and paste everything i need into a section as a single item in the list instead of everything becoming its own item in a list
__label__3 please make an google account login tired of microsoft auth shenanigans
__label__3 its good i like the little picture icons i wish for 2 things that you can share as a jpg file and not a txt file to email and that the length of the boxes represented the amount of time used for example snack time would be a short box sleep would be a long box thanks
__label__1 after latest update notifications not going away after pressing 1cup
__label__3 it's a pity that your tasks become overdue not according to your system time
__label__4 good replacement app for wunderlist perhaps even better i just got it a couple of weeks ago so we shall see it's easy to use and i like the look of it
__label__1 unskippable pop up video adds with sounds awful and completely inappropriate for 'business' as the name suggests i shall look forward to deleting this app and avoiding this developer from now on
__label__4 very helpful a bit hard to completely customize but much of that is due to how much flexibility there is
__label__3 add an offline check in feature
__label__2 it's just a skin for google calendar
__label__1 soooo disappointing had to find a substitute for my habit minder app when i moved to android habit tracker seemed the interface is great love the tracking graphs but its reminders don't work consistently at all which defeats the whole purpose really miss my habit minder and hope they make an android version soon
__label__5 this app is perfect for my personal task management you can make it as simple or complex as you want i like how easy it is to quick add tasks schedule and how i can integrate with gcal every idea i have to do anything goes in here i need reminders for everything i even use todoist to remind me to change the sheets
__label__3 having to find players to be able to do anything is a bit annoying it's really boring otherwise reminders don't work properly i set a bunch for last night that never happened and a bunch this morning that never happened it's not really built for proper daily routines including things you need to do twice per day so it's not really useful for me
__label__5 samsung note 8 surprisingly robust and easy to use the game aspect is a nice bonus but the core productivity elements are what make this app awesome
__label__2 i loved the app and purchased it to help my son keep up with studying i paid for the premium account which indicates you can log in on multiple devices both ios and android after setting it up on my phone which was easy but took some time when i tried logging onto my son's phone it didn't recognize the account i contacted customer service but didn't hear back it's a nice app really like the features so this was really disappointing i could set it up again on his phone but without me being able to monitor on my phone it's not helpful i still hope someone can help me fix this or i should get a refund for my purchase
__label__2 if the change log doesn't change why would there be another pushed update which causes the date of latest update available to change i don't understand why you wouldnt want to distinguish that part of the update is new and part is older as you say for instance 'ui improvements' and 'add another widget option' instead of having description basically unchanged
__label__5 really good app w nice interface and easy to learn layout lets u divide tasks by projects which i find really useful also gives subtasks which also helps a lot would recommend
__label__1 developer is non responsive for some reason when downloading the app from the play store it associates with the incorrect google account i have verified i am downloading the app with my intended account however it continually associates with the wrong account it's not really a big deal but i was planning to upgrade to premium with my play store credits the account this app associates to does not have any
__label__5 as someone who is obsessed with trendy planners with pops of color i can't get enough of artful agenda it combines the convenience of a digital calendar with the joy of having a fun planner to organize everything in and they ade always adding new features that are awesome
__label__3 the apss so far is the best to do apps i have use however the tag unable to sort alphabetically we hav to everytime sort manually not user friendly i will rate 5 star if can settle this problem
__label__4 very nice app and easy to use my only complaint is that i wish there was an option to have a weekly view in block format like a planner versus just the timeline but it is still very convient to use the routines
__label__5 a nice application with a interface designed to have the ability to give you a reminder heads up for coming events it seamlessly absorbed info from my calander alarm clock and prayers salah reminder keep up the good work
__label__3 the most important features needed 1 a multiple sort features like alphabetical then by priority date etc we are talking about very organized people using these lists 2 a data import and export feature to backup import lists csv files so the 500k people who used listmaster can transition to your app while keeping our info safe if our phone dies or is lost or stolen 3 a feature to attach files or pictures make all of these additional features for 1 month to get monthly income
__label__3 generally i liked this app but i found it very frustrating that i couldn't view all my tasks in one area ie inbox or by by date i had to go through each list individually
__label__2 useless no nesting
__label__1 poor interface
__label__3 ok
__label__1 i am unable to upgrade my account to premium i've tried multiple times but to no avail
__label__3 migrating from wunderlist couldn't have been more painful first i had to open microsoft account just for this app then importing from wunderlist messed up owners all lists that were shared to me ended up as mine i had to re share them to the original owner again anyone invited to the list must have ms accounts i had people leaving because of this and i don't get any notifications when people add new tasks it may look the same as wunderlist but the app is starting to annoy me
__label__1 reminders are a premium feature enough said
__label__1 looks good but it doesn't sync with events from existing calendars it only syncs the holiday calendar but not my personal calendar
__label__2 cannot sync what is going on
__label__5 really intuitive but also has loads of functionality looks great very responsive even on my low spec phone does much more than google equivalent worth moving to if you want your calendar to be separate from your to do lists i do that said i'm confident there would be some fairly easy way to do almost anything with this app never felt better about giving five stars to an app
__label__3 size should be more large nd alarm needed
__label__3 great but missing exchange tasks on widget please add
__label__3 no to do hstoryi tracking
__label__2 the premium version might be good but the free version is more restricted then other to do apps you can not even use the labels tags function without paying if you are looking for a free todo list this is probably not the app for you
__label__5 love love love the app i love the colors i love that i can change or edit my list i just found out i love that i can copy my list and make him into a sub list i love that it has easy swipe to delete them i love that i can have several lists under one sub list i have several different notes list apps and this one is by far number one the best
__label__3 widget doesn't work properly pls fix it mi a2 lite android one
__label__3 i'm liking it but it seems to have some bugs it's currently 01 13am but the widget and app are still showing yesterday's calendar sectors and event list
__label__3 i really liked the app but couldn't find a way to integrate it with my google tasks which is a most for me it is a very complete app i would even consider a premium subscription if it was a one time thing and not a yearly monthly system i will check this again in a couple of months to see if it has improved
__label__2 it doesn't sync up with google tasks not worth the change zapier does not work for android zapier only works if you pay the premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with google tasks it does not import current tasks previously created in google tasks there is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from google to anydo and i can't afford 72 00 right off the bat to do it
__label__2 it was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange and with new update you can't even open the app from the widget you have to create a seperate icon which is super super annoying probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon
__label__5 brilliant
__label__3 hi today the editing or deleting of events stoped working when selected to be edited the event opens in a window without it's name and if you choose edit the window closes and goes back to the calendar also by swiping your finger on the list it can not be deleted i really love the app it's has worked perfectly so far but like this it's useless please advise kind regards marta santos
__label__1 i'm sure this would be a great app if you could actually use it but it only allows you do add things from another calendar making it useless if you don't have one
__label__3 i can't type not because of my phone there must be some mistakes
__label__2 the app is good to use overall except as a number of other folks have said it does not sync and there is no response from the developer on this issue annoying to have paid for an app that claimed the sync feature when it doesn't actually work what that means is you lose all history every time you change the phone
__label__4 the essence and notion of this application is not just to define activities from day to day basis but to remind us that its really not about perfection its about progress this application teaches us not just to address holistically in our commitment and time management but also push drastically at the same time our attitude towards commitments senior project engineer here it really helps alot thank you
__label__1 won't sync with microsoft todo in the office which is what i most need
__label__3 too many long advertisements when i need my calendar
__label__1 why does this basic app need access to my contacts and refuse to work without give me a break you filthy parasites
__label__4 its a good app
__label__5 best habit app i have tried love the flexibility task list and look good job
__label__2 awesome app the only missing thing is that you can only set a date i would like to have buttons to remind me later on the day or on the next day or next week update no what i meant is that i want to say remind me today and not remind me at date today at specific time update i would then receive the notification at a specific time 5 hours later or something that can be altered in the settings and also i don't want to put in a date look at the app ticktick has exactly what i want
__label__5 always reliable great statistics for understanding
__label__4 doesn't really sync with my calendar as events are added edit user error with delay in google calendar
__label__2 the app itself is quite good but without offline mode it's useless for me
__label__4 ads have changed from a small bar at the bottom to a full page screen that you could close to a full screen video that you can't close until you watch the whole thing
__label__1 the pop up adverts are so loud terible
__label__5 i totally recommend this app it had help me on every possible way it's really helpful if you really want to develop a new habit i specialy like the easyness to configure the habits and the reminders the motivational notes that you can find around are just right but its true that is not a magic app please if you want to create a new habit you have to work for it you have to work to create something if you do that you'll see the true colors of this magnificent app be true to yourself
__label__5 very good
__label__5 this app is working really well for me definitely helping me stay on track with habits i'm working to build and stop
__label__1 the whole app is based on the system calendar app when adding showing tasks use apis but personnalize the design
__label__5 this app have everything from ui to features without costing much best in the market
__label__4 its good for me and it really helpful
__label__3 i dont like u use numbers instead of yes or no but it doesnt show any difference on the calendar eg color difference
__label__5 functional does everything i want it to do versatile and allows for both habits and one off tasks the only improvement i want to make is changing the colours of the completion status icons
__label__4 i love the look of it and how it helps me see my schedule i don't like that not all my events show up on the widget if it worked like it was supposed to it's a five star app
__label__1 this app is lacking any functionality i can use my google calendar and get better task organization that this weak app doesn't even show all of your tasks and if you change a time it won't changebit for all the recurring tasks
__label__4 easy to use effective and fun can't afford the premium though
__label__5 the best idea
__label__3 it's pretty good so far i'm still working on coordinating it with my other organisational apps
__label__3 love the experience will give 5 starts when there wont be any subscription for pro features one time purchse is what will make this app perfect
__label__3 every time you ask me to rate it my review goes down a star stop asking me to rate it i already have
__label__3 the feature of customization for repeating calendar event function has disappeared when attempting to modify it used to asked do you want to delete all calendar event in the series or delete this particular function except for grandfathered calendar functions the feature of attempting to delete a particular calendar function event no longer exists
__label__3 can't set times for when tasks need to be completed can't tick off tasks for the next day
__label__5 it does everything i need it to
__label__4 delete imformation i had typed in didn't understand why it kept taking me to my google calendar
__label__4 very good i love that flagged emails appear as tasks in this app i would love an option to bring all of the day before's task to today in one go instead of having to add them back to my day one by one i love the planned tasks feature too so i can see all of the tasks with due dates assigned to them lists can be added for different contexts subjects and people i would prefer a few more options than today tomorrow and next week this is a great app
__label__2 so it was good until yesterday whenever i tap on the store it keeps refreshing and never opens i can't unlock any tree or even check them out i sent a picture thank you for the quick response
__label__4 it's not as straight forward as others but i like the many color options i have a task that is a grocery list so it is lengthy in moving from list to list i have accidentally removed items i don't see an undo
__label__1 hides too much behind the subscription the day views are an example of this you'll need to pay each month for the ability to see your data displayed in month week 3 day etc the app feels broken with all of buttons you can press that nag you to pay monthly for features that should only be paid for once the features that aren't locked behind the subscription can be found in other to do apps i tried this app and ended up choosing a different one
__label__3 приложение хорошее но багов очень много и с каждым днём все больше и больше
__label__4 haven't come across a better app if it's type it's not a project management tool but you can have a list in your reminder it's probably a big leap but if i could share the task list with somebody without exporting that would be cool the notification repeat export control is brilliant really helps me organise my home tasks without being frustratingly intrusive and distracting i've tried a lot of applications this is second to none
__label__1 took before the renewal date have not recieved my refund and canceled on the due date
__label__2 it would be better if there are more options for customising the avatar and theme which is in purple you will need to spend money for a decent background the avatar is pixelated and doesn't look good getting a bit bored of it now
__label__4 i don't know it works good and i like that you can add notes to the task that is very helpful i just kind of would like to have a better weekly view but all in all it gets the job done
__label__2 it's very simple and it's interface is so beautiful why did i put 2 stars then because most of it features are limited to the paid edition even the important ones
__label__2 routines don't last forever any more
__label__5 this app helps motivate me to complete my personal goals love it
__label__3 can you add more than 2 hours
__label__3 there's a lot to be improved hope this app to get better with the time
__label__3 timer not working when screen locked
__label__1 i had really begun to depend on this app and was having fun then i downloaded the update i now have nothing not even the image of an avatar there's just nothing there i have no experience no level no coins nothing i was having a really awful day and this was just icing on the cake there was so much i put into this game how can i remember all of the tasks i scheduled for myself i am so so discouraged
__label__1 monthly payments for a todo app not gonna happen thank you
__label__3 i'm not able to sync events i add in this calendar with my google calendar even though i specifically pick the google calendar every time i add a event also i'm not getting any notifications prior to events you have to manually add reminders for each event you just can't set a setting to be reminded x minutes before any event turns out you need to have your phone default calendar enabled to sync your events and to get notifications from this app
__label__4 the idea is great i've used it many times to stay focused and stay on task i enjoy the fact that you can write lil bios of on your trees however the app would be tremendously more useful if i were able to restrict certain apps for a period of time rather than not using my phone at all i still want to use certain apps like music and reading apps rather than not having access to my phone at all
__label__2 in general i really like this app but every time it does an update or my phone restarts i have to go to redo the battery optimization settings because otherwise i don't receive notifications this is just ridiculous that it doesn't save my settings 3 months later and still have the same problem
__label__3 its only been one hour and it is working so far done one hour of work and did not touch my phone only time will tell lol
__label__5 great app i would like to have the option for purchasing a permanent full version i wouldn't mind paying 20 usd
__label__1 requires signing up which i only assume is to spy on me for profit
__label__3 excellent app with plenty of functionality for free users and worthy upgrades for paid users i love that it can be used across multiple platforms that being said it's super unreliable so i'd never upgrade repeated tasks sometimes get marked off and stay on the current day needing to be marked completed as many as 5 7x before moving to the next day sometimes when you add a task it'll disappear maybe related to server syncing but not always so you better remember defeats the purpose
__label__3 don't like it very much but i think it's just not for me it's very complex and deep with tasks and such i could even set the percentage of fear for a task what so i didn't get very far before i just said forget it my life is too busy for such complexity
__label__4 would love to be able to customize the app more need to add a dark theme and also add an agenda view
__label__4 so far i am enjoying this task app i am still learning new things but is definitely helping me stay organized
__label__4 this is my favorite daily schedule app it is so simple to use and super versatile i paid for the pro version just so i could do everything and it was well worth it
__label__4 haven't been using this app for long but it seems great so far i love that incompleted tasks roll over to the current day i just wish you could attach attach photos or files to your notes that would make this a 5 star review
__label__3 good app
__label__2 it is a good apps but i can't open it since the second times it showed it had frequently crashed i need to uninstall everytime
__label__4 great habit tracking tool the widget on the home screen is a great size so i can see quickly how well i'm doing and the options at set up are thorough i'm tracking all sorts of things and it's easy to see how i'm doing highly recommended only concern is i'm having trouble getting a response on a _potential_ issue i have not sure it's real yet but if it is i'm concerned otherwise five stars
__label__4 it s great
__label__5 why take down show more or less function on note after latest update version dec 17 2019 it's really useful
__label__4 i'm surprised this app actually works for me it helped me procrastinate less but i also realised it works only if i remind myself to check the app a lot i recommend it for those who have really bad procrastination problems like myself even if the game style of this app isn't your thing it's a great to do list app for habits daily reminders and general to do items only complaint is it's glitchy for me when i want to customise my avatar
__label__2 additionally having to manually go thru and re invite contacts for every task again is not customer friendly really disappointed
__label__3 better to improve the app features
__label__2 please add option to add voice notes
__label__3 pros i like the layout i like the ease of entering tasks i like the widget cons no check off when complete no accountability tracking it just didn't help at all with keeping me on task
__label__2 sync is not good
__label__2 useless and time consuming got pro version but no option for refund
__label__3 a very good but incomplete idea there is no way to track time spent on certain habits there is a big difference between doing 5 minutes of something and doing it for 1 hour besides the statistics are super limited and basic
__label__3 full screen ads
__label__3 very litle one
__label__4 goooood app helps to get in track
__label__2 can do better very complex to handle for newbies
__label__4 i like it also i would like like a wedget but for the block screen then you don't need to open the phone only activate the screen in order to see the next task in your calendar
__label__2 i want to love this app but lately after once i open this app then the second time i want to open it it just doesnt open i dont know why so i need to keep uninstall and reinstall back and it annoyed me
__label__3 best wunderlist replacement i can find expensive widget doesn't scroll which makes me really sad i can't keep wunderlist
__label__3 seems good but i would need admin approval to access my work outlook calendar so it's pretty unusable for me
__label__2 i love the idea but there are syncing issues events take forever to show on the graph regardless of whether i entered them in the sectograph app or my google calendar they show up in my google calender almost automatically regardless of the same also i think 12 hour clock makes it tricky to read since the switch from am to pm is in the middle of the day i have something starting at 12 30 and i cant see it on the sectograph but there is a little arrow at that start time with the first letter of that event and nothing else it's confusing
__label__1 the timer doesn't work while screen is off i do not get any notifications that timer is up
__label__1 an average task manager that asks 16gbp for the annual subscription no thanks and there are better free and paid alternatives that are better organised
__label__3 i purchased the paid version and i'm sort of disappointed every time i enter a task it adds the first letter of the first word over again so i have to change it each time i e it will autocorrect to eevery instead of every it is also kind of laggy it could be a great app but not as is
__label__5 i like this app it is an amazing tool however i couldn't find calendar and where i can track what i have done could you help me find it
__label__3 nice app overall it does what it promises i have two issues with this 1 the widget seem broken previously when i click on the task and mark as complete now it takes me to the task management page and there is no way to mark that as complete from there i have to open the app to do that 2 there is no way to sort tasks based on date as a user when i open a task list i should see all tasks that are coming up so i can plan accordingly i have to manually do that when i mark as complete
__label__3 not really an exciting app
__label__3 this habit tracker is fairly good in its own right but there are ways it can be improved a lot perhaps it can be more specific perhaps it can become more addictive with certain rewards for teaching certain goals
__label__1 this app is a total rip off i stupidly paid for the one time subscription of 35 00 had the app less than one hour the print was so tiny i could barely see it a lesson learned the hard way no more app subscriptions for me users beware forewarned is forarmed hang on to your wallets if you try out this app
__label__3 i'm still trying it out but so far it has helped a lot one would not waste time if they have this app in hand
__label__5 thanks for the quick work everything works now i really do like this app and use it on the daily so i'm glad it's working again
__label__2 love the app but it crashes often and then your trees don't grow
__label__3 great app but i can't scroll through all tasks when the app is open hope that you'll fix that bug
__label__5 there are options to give your avatar a wheelchair and there are a lot of colors to choose from as well as a skinnier body type or a larger one i don't use a wheelchair but i just loved this option so much because i have friends who do and it really means a lot to them so cute lol
__label__4 i first installed this app on an older tablet where the performance was an issue since i have installed it on my smartphone it has performed above average
__label__3 i have a moto e 1st gen and i updated forest app using google play result forest app gets a crash everytime i try to use it fix the bug it runs android kitkat
__label__3 i paid for the premium version and had expected it to work unfortunately i've been missing quite a few reminders because somehow they stopped working the notifications didn't show at all if this problem persists i want to cancel my monthly subscription
__label__5 excellent app i like how seamlessly it zaps to other apps
__label__3 this is a good app but the data analysis and visualization is fundamentally broken the score and success percentage function in that they record the success values for the end of each day and then add that to the database this means unfortunately that your success percentage never goes above your first day when if you did the thing you got 100 as such the visualizations are useless a better solution would be to include rolling means of success percentage by x number of day intervals
__label__3 irrespextive of having task completed there should be a way of having access to your do list as long as it is not deleted one might want to crosscheck a few sruffs they should fix that issue
__label__1 however i found it a helpful app helping me to stay focused on my projects i am disappointed how could you just double or even triple the price of the trees through an update that wasn't not fair
__label__3 jus started using so far i like it
__label__2 password reset is broken cannot transfer it to a new cell phone think twice before buying this app the habit related side is good however this is why i bought it
__label__4 make life easier to keep track of everything
__label__3 it allows me to leave the app i have a techno phone how do i fix this sleeptown works perfectly though
__label__4 we are using this as a group in my family and it honestly is helping us a lot with staying motivated i have a difficult time with my anxiety and depression but this app has helped me to feel a sense of accomplishment i am experiencing inspiration a little more often and i have been struggling for years with this there are some aspects i'm not entirely fond of that i hope will continue to be updated however i'm grateful to the developers for making and keeping up with this
__label__1 em app ra bai ardham ai sasthaledhu
__label__5 i just love how convenient all the settings are as someone who loves lists
__label__5 its a really good display of the day ahead exactly what i needed and it works great with the local calender
__label__3 smart looking calendar but is unusable for business my scheduled tasks are all forwarded to current day and wont show up in month view widgets don't agree or display the same info after managing my calendar accounts to only two app gives me five to choose from even deleted google calendars a waste of time i now use samsung calendar widget one click on task lists it brings up same beautiful translucent widget theme in month view that agrees in format and my appointments thank you
__label__4 love this app helps me a lot
__label__1 i don't know how i feel
__label__2 why you gotta pay for push notifications or reminders at a certain point you guys are just a company trying to get rich
__label__1 i can easily exit the app by clicking the home button and go anywhere i want to the purpose of the app is to stop us from navigating other apps which i don't see getting fulfilled i can even go to tabs that i opened and didn't exit without my tree being killed at first i didn't know that it was that easy to fool the app but after tad a bit of time i realized that it was pretty easy to open youtube while my tree was growing and still ensure that my forest is lush and green it's lame
__label__3 please make checkbox rectangle its wierd to have a circle checkbox feel like a bullet point but its not
__label__5 amazing app meets requirements and even excels them well done on this app and notifications notes and reminders are all taken care if and safely delivered to you on time
__label__2 subpar so far the difficult to me is syncing lists between family members this app tends to produce multiple lists of the same theme
__label__3 is it true that non premium version soon will loose any way for backup restore or transfer to another phone if not true please point to me what is the backup restore way that stays in app in the future thanks a lot if true that is really bad news backup is a basic necessity so non premium version will become practically useless on the long term in addition premium costs twice as much for a single year than let's say osmand for eternity and that is a much more complex app the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits tasks is a really nice app except that swichingt between sublists lists is unreasonably slow with some unique and essential features but this wracks it it will drive me away possibly others too not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that response to steven nottage's response that is fair enough except for one important detail all the people using your free app are now forced to decide if they want to have a meaningful app to pay or search for another app premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities if you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing people will buy it lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay i payed for a number of apps all cheaper than yours btw and actually my plan was to pay donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear because i thought the app is really useful and it deserves support this change is different i do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc just that you should not remove the free local backup or any other feature or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start best wishes response to steven nottage's second response actually you can clearly see from my review that i do not want everything for free my problem is different if we could not understand each other so far perhaps it's not worth trying any more so i won't comment on the rest of your answer all the best
__label__3 good
__label__2 the new widget does not allow me to open the app directly like it could before updates should never remove features knocking my review down rest of the app is still great
__label__1 you are replying its free app but in every option it shows you can get access to this tool after purchasing
__label__3 it'd be better if it allowed more than 5 habits to be listed
__label__2 would you quit directing me to the website if i want to join a party guild it should be done on the app it won't let me log in on the site at all why you people would choose to have it so if you use log in using google it resets and begins a whole new account without asking now i have two accounts on one email it won't even give me my password i tried resetting it several times how annoying bad design after i spent so much time on the app too all for it not to work
__label__4 great but can be annoying with notifications and also is not quite as customizable as i'd like definitely helps to track your habbita though
__label__3 i have been using forest since 2017 and had collected over 3000 coins unfortunately my phone got stolen and i had to buy a new one now when i reinstalled the app it's saying that i need to start collecting again and to log in i need a premium account which i have never had how can i get my points back thank you
__label__3 i used to love this app and recommend it to friends regularly the updates have made it harder to use i don't need anything fancy i just need a list i don't want to clear or uncheck all items on my grocery list i just want to go through it and untick the ones i need today i regret ever using the 'smart' grocery list bc now even though i have turned it off it won't revert to basic and my list is essentially useless
__label__1 i don't know why i can't seem to be able to adjust the hours correctly when i updated the time to wake up at 7 30 am but the app keep displaying i'm to wake up at 6 30am what's wrong wasted my time keep trying to update it this is good effort for developer to create this app but can pls fix all the issue may seem minor but to me it's confusing and thus rendering it less useful tq
__label__3 this is app is perfect just need a checklist and daily weekly and monthly tracker for each task had it been have all these i would have given all 5 stars you know sometimes we miss or intentionally ignore reminders and we need trackers for those for self development
__label__3 love it so far wish it had a widget for android though
__label__4 does what it promises tracks habits
__label__3 needs an in app guide to make the user understand how it works update i really appreciate you responding and working on it thanks
__label__3 was great but monetized and less useful as features are locked behind a subscription
__label__1 not user friendly
"__label__3 به حسگر اثرانگشت وصل نمیشه بک آپ نداره و برنامه حذف بشه اطلاعات پاک میشه 
 محیط کاربریش خوبه"
__label__2 nice app but i want to unlock the whitelist feature but it's not working please look to it as i want to unlock the whitelist feature for free
__label__3 generally pretty good but a lot of awkward design choices no compact mode inefficient use of colors for organization difficulty selecting and moving tasks lack of icon consistency preset snooze and reminder time options rather than being able to choose them yourself
__label__1 does not send notifications unless the app has been opened recently completely defeats the purpose of the reminders
__label__4 very easy to use plus best time route app available
__label__5 this app rocks goodness perfect for daily tasks and appts
__label__2 sadly the ui isn't adapted for the pixel 3 xl
__label__5 works very well on android phones does not have a steep learning curve
__label__2 i want to start my week with saturday and it is not available only can change between sunday monday
__label__3 very long time user latest updates are making things harder subtasks in recurring parent tasks are now automatically archived when completed and don't seem to reappear when parent task is due again example i have a weekly todo titled groceries with grocery items i need to buy as subtasks within that recurring parent task whereas before i could mark a subtask as complete and expect that same subtask to reappear next time when i go shopping again it's now completely gone
__label__1 i like wunderlist more the widget was more clear and date of not completed tasks had red color which was for me visually much better also i just choose to see on widget today and automatically everyday my chores were added from all lists ehhh why the good things must end not happy at all i hope my old wunderlist will work
__label__3 seems like i really great app but i just installed it and i couldn't get passed the avatar creation screen
__label__3 weather not accurate it would be nice task have options on bottom of calendar too
__label__2 migrated from wunderlist can't share my list with my spouse always gets errors todo list unusable without sharing working 1 for dark theme though
__label__4 paid experience is better than free but it will do since there are no ads ui and design can be made note clutter free
__label__2 i love this app but i don't know what's happened the notifications for reminders dont work whenever i try to set the time zone it's force stops
__label__3 don't have any options to manage daily expenses
__label__2 really 8 for a habit tracker there are other apps that do the same thing for far less money i don't mind paying for apps but this seems like price gouging oh and it's 10 if you want the ability to export your data
__label__2 the only thing that is missing is to open specified event after click on a widget for now i can give for stars i'll give more when this feature will be available edit after upgrade adding widget to homescreen only allocates place but is invisible when it finally showed up it doesn't have promissed functionality
__label__4 works well overall but recently won't add entry from widget on homescreen it would be great if items from the planned task categories with a due date would automatically be added to my day on said due date rather than having to open the planned task categories and adding to my day from there just a thought
__label__5 fantastic app it has so many options to adjust i love the widget on phone screen my husband has started to use it as well thank you
__label__5 perfect app for what it is made for i even purchased premium so i could add more habits and also get the dark mode option i am a music producer and if anybody does any form of creative art for a living then you will know how easy it is to get carried away and spend hours doing that this app has helped me to stay on top of other tasks such as eating healthy spending time with my pets and going to the gym everyday so thank you god bless and have a great day instagram av_theartist
__label__3 came highly recommended tried it hate that i can't see the subtasks in a project why even and apparently that's a recent update well no one seems to like this feature or at least there should be an option to either have subtasks or not so hope you guys bring it back will use it then another observation most of the top notch features are unavailable to non premium users and not many are willing to subscribe seems a bit unfair one time payment would be great will that change
__label__5 lovely app with good ui
__label__1 this app is a total rip off i stupidly paid for the one time subscription of 35 00 had the app less than one hour the print was so tiny i could barely see it a lesson learned the hard way no more app subscriptions for me users beware forewarned is forarmed hang on to your wallets if you try out this app
__label__3 generally very good i have a few problems when i use it for reminders working out what i need to write for a week of reminders in 10 days time is a bit challenging
__label__4 i love this app i would however like if you could add something more to make the app feel even more polished and more peaceful for instance animals that wonder around your forest and the healthier the forest the more animals come or you could move your trees and add rivers worth the 2 00 for premium very good for big groups to focus i love the store and the fact that you can buy different trees to grow get different sounds and music
__label__4 please add two factor authentication i couldn't post my request through app because i don't have a facebook account to log in
__label__2 have been using this app for years and have loved it however a recent update that includes full screen ads alsolutely kills it i do appreciate that the developer has kept the app clean and free for the last few years but with full screen ads no sorry
__label__4 great app keeps me on task and organized freezes a bit and didn't show all of my planned events i had to reprogram but other than that no issues at all
__label__3 app looks great ui is wonderful and the feature it have they all are useful only problem because of which i uninstalled the app was simple and basic features like recurring task creations are made premium switching to tick tick for the same reason
__label__1 why isn't this app getting downloaded there is some issue with the app it had been recommended to me by my buddy but this thing isn't getting installed on my phone
__label__3 i tried it since it had integrated many features from wunderlist it still falls short there is no option to view all to do's at once that was the main killer for me i'm sticking with wunderlist
__label__5 does what i need it to no account required
__label__5 it was great cool app the best for habit tracking
__label__1 for years we used wunderlist for work including employees without corporate accounts for family outside organisation and across continents todo failed from the get go but to be fair so do most other tasklist apps we tried many we finally moved to trello a bit different to wunderlist and not quite as intuitive but works across platforms across organisations it sadly seems ms loves to destroy good things wunderlist was such a good product we were really sad to see it go
__label__5 easy to use effective to create habits
__label__1 in basic app why can't even add comment its not even basic when it comes to free
__label__5 realizing wunderlist was going away was unfortunate but this app does a great job at replacing it i really like the graphics and the background image of the needle
__label__1 worked for 2 days now i can't enter anything i enter date time description hit save it says saved but nothing shows up on the lo k dial thingy too bad nice oncept tho
__label__2 the app is good but the differences between the premium and free version aren't mentioned at the beginning it is also not possible to start using the app without the free trial period as far as i have seen after the forced free trial period i now realize that the sync function which enables you to use pc and and app simultaneously is indeed a premium function this seems awful lot like the way evernote took i want to buy my apps because i appreciate the work not because i'm forced into
__label__3 it'd be better if it allowed more than 5 habits to be listed
__label__3 how about letting us pick from a custom color palette for each list the supplied ones are insipid and limited also sharing my wife and i keep getting this message when trying to share lists not all of them just some go figure unavailable list it looks like this list isn't available try contacting the person who invited you err okay then what bringing over shared lists from wunderlist is a disaster utterly out of sync
__label__2 i tested a few task apps and this one looked promising at first but very quickly i hit the paywall even for basic and essential features such as reminders and labels i'm going to use trello instead
__label__4 a great tool to see what's going on in your day i linked work and personal calendars into one the customisable buttons are a nice touch and allow you to make it work the way you want it to
__label__2 to do list apps like this one are not useful without the capability of using recurring tasks too bad because the interface is otherwise well done
__label__3 i used to like this app it is simple and easy to use but lately it keeps deleting subtasks or not saving correctly so i go back to do thing i needed help remembering it to find it gone it also could be a lot easier to add a reminder notification
__label__4 very good app the only thing is that the minimum time is ten minutes and a lot of times i want to concentrate for five minutes otherwise really cute and it works correctly
__label__3 i thought i finally found my reminder but this app lacks 2 important aspects 1 no possibility to sort tasks in chronological order why 2 no persistent sound like any other rekinder app i ve met why plus no subtasks
__label__3 finds all but my primary account on my phone therefore i'm unable to even try
__label__4 great
__label__3 constantly crashes if type too fast pointer disappears page bounces to another section then back again sometimes deleting text just entered went from a galaxy note to a galaxy j7 didn't have these issues with the note so to be fair not sure if its the app or my new device help update now app causes device to not work properly get this message system ui not responding app causes device to freeze uninstalled app device went back to normal
__label__3 there is an issue in this app where comments dont show up on mobile app but you can see it on desktop or web i have to logout from the app for the comments to appear this happens every now and then when it happens i just need to logout and login but i find that inconvenient pls fix
__label__1 every tiny feature of this app requires an 'upgrade' if you're planning to use a free version of this app don't bother the developers are hands down the most money hungry developers i've ever seen
__label__3 i needed a replacement for wunderlist which we relied on for task lists for our business employees with ticktick i had to manually type in each task for each list because the import feature only put them in my inbox there's no home screen hitting the return arrow exits the app not a biggie just an adjustment the real downer is having to pay to share the lists with more than one person collaboration was an important feature we needed using microsoft's to do for now
__label__3 this app needs a combined list of all accounts to make it usable
__label__5 i was skeptical at first but wow yes the req to have a microsoft account didn't thrill me but this has all the features wunderlist did and more you just need to find them you can move the order of tasks manually just do an extra long tap on the task and drag there is also a an inbox here it is just called tasks this app is much more flexible in terms of themes than wunderlist was and it makes it really easy to both delete tasks and steps within a task switching was easy too
__label__3 want to put a line through items but leave them visible don't know how to manipulate to keep certain items from week to week but cancel others no instructions but better than other apps that i've seen
__label__1 few years later i love this app because it is best for focus and i give 5star rating but now after update it stop working i can't plant facing many problem to place a plant i updated new version but the bug is still there and their is no option for backup my progress offline or in sd card storage
__label__4 it's a very good app just that sometimes it doesn't open like it's frozen i then have to go force it to stop then try again to open it
__label__3 good app easy to use but the reminders don't work no matter what the app says i should do please do fix that
__label__2 issues with notifications and reminders
__label__1 not really functional
__label__4 it's pretty nice all things considered but i have found a few problems with it mostly the fact that the notifications do not work and by that i mean no matter how many notify alarms i set none of them go off i've downloaded this app on several occasions in the past and i've had the same problems each time the second is that the widget will quite often display that i have no tasks when i in fact have about seven on any given day i'm not taking a star off because of the widget though
"__label__4 cool app seems to have all i need at this point my only 2c would be that 
the widget weekly view should have the option to see the 7 days ahead 
rather than the current week if it's a friday i don't really care what i 
did on monday i wanna know what's happening next monday"
__label__5 beautiful programme i can recommend it for all my friends
__label__4 it's simply the best for time allocation to activities and routines
__label__1 cool concept but sync doesn't work and the desktop add on is half baked i wish the developer would be responsive to my emails as well
__label__1 the first 2 slides are black and i can't see character in the character creation some message saying path 'profile' required habitica i hope this gets fix soon until then i i'll wait
__label__3 it it good but i couldn't do simple lists they would be in one big catagory then in a sub list and it just wasn't the format i wanted
__label__5 best free version todo list app
__label__5 really helpful to track project with simple interface and easy to use anyway it's not a variety of the feature but quite simple
__label__5 this app reminds me everytime i forget about something important and it's all organized i this app thank u so much for making this app
__label__5 great
__label__2 to many features locked behind premium
__label__1 seems broken cant complete the process of creating new tasks so i'm just stuck with a huge empty menu i cant change loved the idea but this is broken and unusable
__label__2 limited unless you buy the full version i spent time looking around trying to work with the app a lot of things i tried wanted me to upgrade which is why i found another i feel my review is fair sorry
__label__5 a great way for a visual person to outline and track their activities
__label__5 simply an excellent app in every way hassle free and very easy to use
__label__5 this is very well design app the calendar mixing of the tasks and events is very handy
__label__1 so disappointing i used to love this app bit over the last few months it is sooooooo glitchy i just spent an hour deleting and checking off tasks from my to do list and everytime i think im done they show back up in triplicate everything i changed is still there after an hour does that sound like a good time management program and no way to contact support because when i try to get to the menu it shows a black screen
__label__2 i like the concept but the execution needs work in my experience the app was laggy non responsive at times which made the experience of creating and managing tasks tedious
__label__1 ads ads ads
__label__2 loved this app until i updated updated it gibberish on every day now it is terrible like this on my phone and tablet how do i fix i depend on this planner
__label__1 can't contact support software erases or moves things without my wanting this no instructions no labels on controls it is more frustration than anything
__label__5 have been using this since 15 days a must have app those who focus on being productive everyday habit tracker is a big plus kudos to the team
__label__5 simple no b s habit tracking forming a habit is hard and it makes sense to track your progress for multiple reasons some apps and methods are almost as hard to use as the habit you are trying to create is to make not habitbull i've only been using the app for about a week now and it has been painlessly helping me work towards my goals and forge a better self
__label__2 widget does not sync refresh properly went back to wunderlist until at least the widget refresh sync issue is solved using android phone tablet and windows 10 the following items which are present in wunderlist should definitely be integrated 1 the option to choose that starred items be moved to top 2 the option to choose that new tasks be added to top 3 folder view in the widget 4 icons under a task on the widget showing that a task has subtasks and or notes in it
__label__5 best app i have downloaded thus far keeps all my task organized with a easy to use app and no annoying ads highly recommend
__label__3 handy
__label__3 there's a bug that makes the app crash in the newest update please fix this asap
__label__4 very nice app but who really needs to be reminded of and check off things we do all the time in daily life if something is important next week or whenever we normally remember it without fail or we write it down this app while very nice indeed typifies and feeds society's obsession with mobiles and tablets and it renders people even more stupidly 'dependent' upon help instead of what used to be 'common sense '
__label__5 excellent and terbaik
__label__2 doesn't let you choose specific calendar events to ignore no way to track how you actually spent your time if it didn't match your calendar
__label__3 great and powerful app except for one thing location doesn't work when entering addresses whenever i type an address with house numbers the location recommendation list never contains the house number
__label__2 it sucks
__label__4 i just need notification tone more than these and much more long
__label__3 i used to like this app it is simple and easy to use but lately it keeps deleting subtasks or not saving correctly so i go back to do thing i needed help remembering it to find it gone it also could be a lot easier to add a reminder notification
__label__4 i didn't understand how to add subtask in template i pressed save as template but it saved only the name of template i couldn't find any information about template in help centre please explain me how to add subtask in template
__label__5 exactly like wunderlist where i came from because that's being discontinued happy i have a viable replacement but sad to see wunderlist go
__label__2 not worth when i use other apps it keeps the timer on what's the reason behind it god knows i can't even get other species of plant as bcoz as soon as i try to do so it shows 'the forest app has stopped' and just after a second if i reopen the app then except for this function of get other species other every function i can perform
__label__2 it's just okay
__label__2 i don't want make an account before trying out the app give us a week trial before making us sign up please
__label__1 i need an app with free reminders i forget a lot of things so this is not fair i'm uninstalling
__label__3 i'm using the premium version recently it stop updating the total time focused by itself when comparing with other friends
__label__2 by default before the current update was rolled out tasks were set to the date 'today' now they are being set to feb 1 3880 how weird
__label__3 generally a useful app i've found using a visual reminder to stay focused has helped and working toward unlocking new plants was fun i found the recent increase in cost to unlock plants demotivating and i've been using the app less since it happened
__label__4 i love this app and the idea behind it with the weekly and daily routines i wish i could view my month or week at a glance however so i can see my weekly routine and how my non reoccurring events affect and lay out with my routine
__label__1 hate it the original app was perfect for my needs this is a complicated mess searching now for a different solution
__label__1 unable to see the widget on huawei honor play after adding the widget to my microsoft launcher it does not appear
__label__4 i like all the scheduling possibilities and tools i'm giving it 4 stars because the alarm i have set thru the app can't be turned off i had to uninstall it just to get it to turn off very annoying
__label__4 this app has helped me be productive with the amount of features it has the only negative i would say is that i would have liked to see the reminders feature included for free
__label__3 ummmm the app still runs even if i open another app
__label__4 keeps all meetings organized great app
__label__5 tag meee
__label__5 beautiful programme i can recommend it for all my friends
__label__5 i usually don't write reviews in fact this is my first but this app is worth a few words of appreciation it works well is easy to use and helps me keep track of my activities habits it reminds me to too in a non intrusive way if you are looking for an app to help build a habit this app is worth giving a try
__label__3 helps me stay organized
__label__1 costs money to make pixels darker
__label__5 easy to install very similar to wunderlist but much easier was a wunderlist user for over 5 years loved the app kept my finances on straight and narrow thank you for do this amazing list did not like the new microsoft office task list far to difficult to get let alone use i don't have time to fiddle around on phone and this takes me straight to my lists i also used wunderlist for shopping planning events loads i am looking forward to using this app
__label__5 the more i use this app the more i love it i've been looking for something like this for a long time one thing i'd like to be able to sort my routines chronologically rather than alphabetically
__label__3 have not fully tried this app yet but the images and graphical user interface is appealing to me hopefully this app would be able to meet my requirements in my daily life chores
__label__5 still the best by far and even better with online sync backup this is the first todo list i've ever paid for and been happy to do it i love the granular approach to organisation so you can get as complex as you like i use it every day for just about everything
__label__4 great app highly recommend it i just wish this app would show the sub tasks in the to do list
__label__1 extremely disappointed i had been a faithful user of this app and loved it then all of sudden everything changed there is no cloud support the tabs option is gone there is no interface with established tasks list i have tried and tried to use i contacted support and they replied that due to streamlining the app it has a completely new appearance i had uninstalled this app however i felt i needed to write thos review after i finish this uninstalling this app useless to me
__label__4 i love this app so much i've had it for almost a week and i've only found one bad thing about it it's absolutely adorable and it's helped me stay off my phone and make it fun to do so the problem i've had is that when i get video chat requests from instagram my trees die but i fixed it by muting video chat requests overall it's super fun
__label__5 best app truely no apps in playsore like this the app will progress in future add more things on this app and update as soon as possible tnx
__label__3 the widget in one line mode could shorten the time spans so they don't take as much space also it doesn't seem to sync well between multiple phones with tasks 10 22 2018 edit not sure how else to respond to the dev but it's task syncing not calendar syncing that's the issue 10 23 2018 edit both devices have task syncs active and are just the main google account
__label__1 i was looking forward to using this app but it wont even let me pick out an avatar things just go blank on the app and tells me i'm missing information when i clearly am not what a bummer
__label__5 i have never seen a more beautifully designed calendar planner app easy on eyes strikes a great balance between functionality and simplicity google and microsoft calendar apps should take inspiration from this and just great when i start earning i'm definitely going to buy this app just to show gratitude
__label__5 great
__label__4 repetition should not be a premium function
__label__5 nice
__label__3 eh it wasn't for me maybe it's because i was using the free version i didn't think this app was very intuitive at all first of all it's very annoying to not be able to set my own reminder times for tasks i had the option to either choose 9 in the morning or 6 in the evening what the heck secondly the reminder feature goes off a little too often only one reminder is needed i know i could have turned notifications off but i did want reminders for my tasks i should have been able to control the number of reminders also it was pretty lame that i couldn't make multiple lists i was just dissatisfied overall with my limited options i deleted and am using another to do list app
__label__5 its very helpful
__label__1 i was not planning to give a review but it left me no choice since its replacing wunderlist which is very useful app which my wife and i love especially for our grocery lists now this to do tries to replace it but can't even get it to work properly if i can give zero star i would
__label__1 inaccurate always says activity overlaps with another activity when it doesn't
__label__5 it really helps me stay organized and keep track of my goals
__label__5 i think its awesome
__label__3 i haven't been using this very long and it's not as user friendly as the calender that came on my last phone i wish instead of dots you can just see what you have entered for that day immediately without tapping on that day otherwise it is easy to use and functional
__label__3 great overall somewhat limited
__label__1 i used to love this app i've been using it for about two years but recently it's started to crash every time i click on the timer i tried an alternative that i didn't like and came back after a couple of months but still no improvement
__label__5 i have had this app for years now it is the best calendar app i have used i like how well it integrates with contacts and how i am now able to attach files definitely makes my life easier
__label__4 it is a very nice way to look at your schedule it also helps you determine productivity whether you are scheduling efficiently and are you allowing yourself some downtime it can use some improvements and i believe that they will happen
__label__2 not paying 3 a month for something my calendar can do
__label__5 helps me to organize my day when i don't have my physical planner at hand held me to remember important and vidal tasks that help sort out my family and daily routines while allowing to add onto my busy schedules throughout the week also able to sort out the important tasks by colour coordination thank you for the opportunity to have a great planner at my fingertips
__label__3 good application
__label__3 need ui refresh though widgets need to show text on a month view theming etc
__label__4 just the best this app has helped me improve at a time i was feeling very down and unable to do anything i only wish the notifications worked better
__label__3 need to increase some options of task editing
__label__4 can this please get a feature where i can add tasks when offline and it uploads to the server whenever i connect to the internet at the moment it simply deletes everything
__label__3 interesting and promising but not refined or intuitive chat function is one of the worst i've ever encountered
__label__1 crashes on android 4 4 miui 9
__label__4 it's good
__label__2 no longer the calendar i use since the intro of annoying ads and video ads uninstalled
__label__3 as great as this app is there is no way to turn off the annoying popups within it 'rate us' 'congrats 10 days in a row' really i can see the result please add an option to turn off all popups within the app
__label__3 hi the reminder feature is not working supporting in my phone also if possible please add support in your app to contact for bugs thank you
__label__5 i love this app it combined of my calendars and keeps me on task
__label__1 i loved this app so much after i downloaded it and used it for about 2 weeks because i loved it so much i decided to purchase the pro full version and payed 4 99 however it was not worth paying at all i would have rather used the free version with the ads i will recommend everyone to download the app and use the free version but dont get the 4 99 ad free version because it doesn't really give you anything extra i would recommend the creator of the app to add more features for payed
__label__5 so far so good i've used other reminder apps with add i have to have reminders of nothing would get done this one let's me snooze the stuff i want to procrastinate on or if i need to be annoyed by the reminder i can do that too all around good app
__label__4 the free option has all the features i need an alarm would be nice but since i don't have the premium i'll do without for now
__label__3 just fine for me i mean it has a smooth transition and everything but all the cool stuff is paid it's like there's nothing extra for freebies you can do the same in a normal calendar
__label__3 the last update caused annoying hesitation delays when working with tasks in task view
__label__3 i am still testing it out but so far do good i like that there is a possibility to organize tasks according to thier importance and nature
__label__2 i found developers lie about free features i just turned into day view i asked to login and then i asked to upgrade in description this option and several other options mentioned as free
__label__1 good app but i can't do anything since to days ago help me please your app je very usefull for me
__label__2 reminders should not be transfered in event section it was better before to figure out events and remiders separatly
__label__1 impossible to delete list or sub lists tabs regret v2 0 upgrade
__label__3 still missing some things from wunderlist notably email reminders which i really miss not always convenient to get reminders on my phone or install the app everywhere email item to inbox better sorting and as an added improvement please remember sorting by folder and add new task at top of list a bit early to be claiming you can now do everything you could as clearly you can't but hopefully getting there
__label__3 i'd mark it higher if the reminder alarm could tell the time the alerts pop up a good 15 45 minutes late
__label__2 this is by far the best out there but it is not reliable because if i get a new phone for whatever reason the data will not transfer to new phone data will be lost or i will not have time to set the settings and input previous data in new phone and that is only reason i cant trust this app i am very upset that one flaw kills a very good app anyone that uses a calender heavily knows the trouble of my example again by far it is a very very good calendar app
__label__4 good
__label__1 do not install you have to pay for everything all you can do is write notes waste of time and storage
__label__5 it cool an usefull
__label__1 don't buy premium you have to pay for an entire year upfront and if you change your mind about the app like i did due to its odd inconsistent behavior with reaccuring tasks and reminders you're given 48 hours after the 7 day trial to qualify for a refund after that you're screwed all most all of the issues started happening after that period ended they obviously know they have problems with the app just read their robotic responses to issues any do hides behind tos instead of helping
__label__3 juat started using this and although it seems to do most of what i need i think it has some basic things missing
__label__2 actually it is a good calendar app but on android 10 google calendars cannot be synched without the google calendar app installed on your device you have to sync your calendar by another calendar app or all your bc2 events will stay on your local device only so this means that another calendar app is required to use this calendar app which makes this app useless at the moment i am waiting for a fix
__label__5 its a great tasks app for me i really appreciate the ability to send a task to my calendar thank you
__label__2 i was keeping track of christmas gifts by checking then off once they were purchased and looking back by selecting show completed tasks until today when i went to check and they are all deleted kind of a bummer it was convenient that the purchased gifts were hidden and nobody could snoop on my phone unless they knew to select that option but now i have to go through my hidden gift stash which if you are a parent you know how immpossible that can be with kids around all the time
__label__3 just didnt use it
__label__1 not work in my tab lenovo yoga 3 bed experience
__label__2 as is typical for microsoft they took over a wonderful product in wunderlist screw it up and jam it down the throat of their customers the ms to do list is harder to use than wunderlist and lost some features that made it convenient to manage your tasks i am convinced ms programmers must never use their own products
__label__4 great app but voice quality sometimes poor
__label__3 i like the app and it's a pity that i won't keep on using it because of the absence of monthly overview for dailies which i need most from a habit tracker instead of useless strikes
__label__4 im using the free app enjoying it alot super easy to capture ideas and reminders when they pop into your head before you forget
__label__2 1 5 20 i have tried the updates since my original post and launch speed has slightly improved main landing page loads very slowly but at least didn't crash right away again almost froze when scrolling through habits i gave it more time to load then tried going to a different section of the app it crashed 11 9 19 would be an awesome app if it would load painfully slow startup and very laggy in app as a well android 9 moto g6 play please fix i will actually update my review
__label__3 not showing contact suggestions after the latest update i am using nokia 6 1 plus with android pie latest security patch
__label__1 got hold of the premium version with high expectations but was disappointed on getting to know that the habits created on a device is not appearing on another device with the same account going back to loop
__label__2 i don't understand why it's not letting me type in it it gets hanged everytime i meant that amake ora onek birokto kortese sorry i speak only bahamian
__label__2 well it is good and motivational but i don't get notifications for the reminder moreover you have to pay for the widget
__label__3 good but not as good as tick tick the weak sorting in todoist limits its effectiveness when managing multiple projects
__label__1 lazy tech support just can't be bothered took down my initial adverse review to give tech support a chance to sort things out they just couldn't be bothered i'm using nine email and having a problem sharing with todoist when i want to create a task using an email sometimes it works more often it doesn't however sharing with wunderlist works every time todoist tech support answer sort it out yourself with nine update after numerous emails to tech support they still haven't bothered
__label__3 so i did not get it does this app only import events from calendar can't i create my own daily routine within this app that would be way cooler to be honest as i barely use calendar
__label__2 it would be a great app if it had an option to use it without syncing it to your calendar like timetune i don't want all my tasks to show up on my calendar and their solution wasn't working
__label__4 good app
__label__2 since 2018 the app does not register some of the calander input apparrently due to poor internet connection now sitting next to the wifi router and entering all my appointments for january needless to say none were regesterred
__label__4 i enjoy the countdown to my next event very helpful
__label__5 a very useful app it helps timely completion of your tasks thanks a lot developers
__label__3 baf
__label__2 great app for your phone but if you need smartwatch functionality look to any do rather than this app in dialogues with the devs theyve stated they have no intentions of integrating even simple wearos apps like add task from watch uninstalled
__label__5 best app ever it keeps track of your habits and if you turn on reminders it also keeps you accountable of the goals you set simply genius
__label__5 first of all i am thrilled with the app if i know how it works is there a list of ready made tasks on the start screen there are some suggested ones when i press the plus button i actually expect a list with all possible tasks but instead of that i only have the possibility to create a new task at first i thought that i had to subscribe i have subscribed now but unfortunately it is still not possible now i have deleted all tasks from the start screen if i click on the plus there is still no list it comes again new task
__label__2 doesnt show you task in calendar only today tasks useless try trello
__label__5 it's all great i just love it it sets my schedule timetable reminders so perfectly fine we can adjust it however we want to
__label__2 changes and cancellations do not get updated on the widget secondly it is not possible to scroll between months easily
__label__3 very useful can't get the tasks to sync with outlook tasks though i only see local tasks would get 5 stars if this was working
__label__1 1 star for obligatory signup using google fb twitter
__label__5 increíble nueva forma de gestionar el calendario alternativa ideal para un widget rectangular aburrido
__label__3 nice but there seems to be no way to hide declined events that makes it much less useful would give 5 5 otherwise
__label__2 useful for organizing the activities of the day but don't have setting on sound to notify the time of activity
__label__3 great app but have a few suggestions that would make it the best app in the market trust me people are looking for this 1 the ability to add your schedule with a few clicks for example you can set reoccuring events but peoples schedules alternate would be great to be able to click the days you work group then at the same time and categorize them under work for reference look at the nursegrid app 2 add your spouse or family directly so everything is synced real time familywall
__label__4 well i like having an agenda where if needed i can be reminded of what i need to do however i am not liking how after 3 5 days of reminders it just stops doing it and i have to go in in order to refresh at this point a normal calendar app preinstalled would be better since i can set it to remind me every day could this be fixed
__label__4 i do like the straight forwardness of this system it does what it says on the tin needs to keep developing but in the theme it's in if it gets to clever like some systems it will loss it's position
__label__2 easy to use and understand i have an issue with the reminder settings if i set a time reminder then it drains my battery so i am not able to use this function otherwise i am happy
__label__3 i did like the app after i'm reinstalling the app what happens to my in app purchase i had purchased the app rt now which i'm using is it the paid one or free one do i need to pay for premium again
__label__2 couldn't change time zone its an hour ahead and no setting to select my time zone
__label__5 good app it helps me be motivated without hesitation nor procastination thank you habitnow your love aliff
__label__3 nice but am looking for something that can synchronize with google tasks
__label__4 i like this app because it's better than another app i found and is really good at reminding me to stick to schedule but i gave it four stars because even though i haven't had any issue with this yet it does have in app purchases wich i don't think are needed here but overall if you need to plan a day or routine use this app
__label__1 cant put in anything in app
__label__5 by far the best task management app
__label__1 i purchased the app to make full use of it and add many habits with a reminder for each but the reminder doesnt work at all initially for some habits it used to remind randomly but after a day of purchasing none of the reminders are working please solve my issue as i really wanted to use this app to its potential
__label__3 think its great but keeps going black and crashing all the time
__label__1 there are better and simple other apps which provide automatic online sync or backup feature like micr_oso_ft's to do and many other why people think this app easy it's not i donated on this app and wasted
__label__5 has helped me stay accountable and prioritize things that i really want to do
__label__5 great intuitive and easy to use
__label__3 decent app fun concept biggest issue right now is that some of the dailies that are supposed to be once per week are still showing up as an every day task which is very annoying sometimes the dailies will cross over into the to do list for an hour or so at a time too
__label__2 unable to open the app after a days of installing it i need to reinstall once again to make it work
__label__3 just tested the pro version needs to be more stable sometimes my work starts at 12 am and it doesn't sync with my google calendar widget needs to be fine tuned not quite satisfied so 3 stars
__label__3 the app keep crashing i reinstalled twice and still crash one day after installed it won't open
__label__3 functional nothing special
__label__1 it took 3 tries to get registered now it wont let me change anything in character creation i didnt even make it to setting up anything beyond skin tone before it wouldn't let me select anything awesome idea crappy execution womp womp
__label__3 ui needs to be improved
__label__5 great features easy to use and modify list details
__label__4 very good app simple to use
__label__5 im so need it
__label__4 pros it's fun lots of customisation all basic functionality are free inclined to habit generation than everyday to do list cons first time setup are quite challenging literally create your own system icons themes are limited minor inconvenience i was using liferpg which seems abandoned now so it helps with the learning curve i see devs made lots improvement here recommended
__label__3 good app however the notification has stopped working
__label__1 cannot use without existing calendar
__label__5 love this app this app had saved me so many stressful headaches the creator is always on top of it and so helpful with everyone's questions install this app you won't be sorry
__label__5 easy to use and customize
__label__3 app is good to use but it's premium so not using now
__label__2 not so great the user interface is not friendly making the to do list takes far too long and theres no way that i found to make a list that repeats daily i'll just stick to google keep
__label__4 so far so good app is great helps me mostly keep track of what i need to do not make sure i do it make it more aggressive wish it had a daily reminder that would just pop up to remind me of all my most recent tasks at the start of the day that i could dismiss just to remind me so i dont have to wait for each task to remind me on or before the due date also when a task is completed it seems to keep reminding me in pop up until i go to the task and scroll to the completed button
__label__4 good
__label__2 my data is now disappearing frequently or often is suddenly double or triple in my calendar
__label__3 it is a very good app for staying focused while studying but the problem i'm facing now is that the music keeps stopping at random intervals and i have to unlock the phone to keep the music playing please look into this otherwise it's a great app
__label__3 great but when you set a target date it doesnt remain as is and shifts to another day for that month
__label__3 events on calendar show's incorrect data and on clicking edit the window closes to home screen
__label__4 easy to use effective and fun can't afford the premium though
__label__3 cool app but still trying it out
__label__3 all awesome except widgets they randomly and annoyingly often stop working phone either needs to be restarted or widgets re added or both
__label__5 אחלה אפליקציה עובדת נהדר גם בעיברית
__label__1 app is no longer functional cant even start app without it malfunctioning cant change username or character it was fine before the update
__label__5 so far app has performed well has many more features that i need to explore recommend it for important reminders
__label__3 paid for it 2 times keeps wanting me to pay for it again
__label__1 too much setup i just want to write my notes not title subtitle everything on the plus side no permissions
__label__2 it's just a simple to do list why did you locked some tools
__label__3 feature request natural language support when typing 'today at 3 pm' or 'tomorrow at 10 am' it should understand and set the due dates accordingly as in wunderlist
__label__2 the minimum timer is 5 mins so useless for me i had hoped to use this as an exercise timer i need alternating time countdowns running consecutively e g 3m 30s 3m 1m 5m 1m plus a reminder for when my favorite combat sports are on tv i'll keep looking
__label__1 no outlook calendar support most business people use outlook
__label__3 i missed the old tiny tree that was at before for 10 minutes of focusing i truely missed it
__label__3 i like this app i really do however one caveat i feel is that it can only sync to a gmail or the native phones calendar outlook calendars are not supported as far as i can tell so for me i work with outlook thus any meetings etc cant be viewed seamlessly with respect to a current timeline plan
__label__3 the app is making me sign in to an account but won't let me sign in frustrated
__label__3 can we please have sub tasks placed under our main task the analytics are not so useful to be honest
__label__3 i m not getting daily reminders for my habits
__label__5 updating for 2020 still the most important app i use it's been life changing todoist is the most important app i use it's a tremendous way to keep track of professional and personal projects and tasks make lists weekly menu shopping lists collaborate at work and keep track of my kids' responsibilities doist is an ethical bootstrapped company with a customer centric vision and a regular release schedule if i could marry todoist you know i would
__label__5 highly motivating and helps to organize and track progress
__label__4 i love habitica however i m think the app misses a lot of functionality when compared with website for example the challenges in a guild is not displayed and the task detail in challenges are also not displayed i mainly used the web version but it would be great if there are not much differences between the website and this app
__label__4 i really like the concept of this app the style the features and it has done its part in motivating my studies and organizing my life however the app needs some serious redesigning the layout is difficult to navigate and the chat function is almost useless the way challenges are organized could also use improvement all in all i like using it make an account a month ago but the functionality needs to be improved
__label__3 resulta incómoda y da pereza usarla falta mucho por mejorar la actualización automática de mi día hace muchísima falta y básicamente uno se tiene que acostumbrar a la app en vez de que a uno le guste
__label__5 very flexible for now waiting for the long term results
__label__3 when i tried putting inmy class scheduel they kept vanishing when i add notes to a specific date it might work fine if you don't need many events but it's a pain if you have a lot to keep track of
__label__4 it's the perfect kind of list i've tried everything is great it could be better if we had a calendar view as well
__label__1 seriously just realised you made duration a premium feature why did people just start using it more all of a sudden
__label__3 i guess i am wanting the routines to have synched my calendar and not my timeline it is not clear how to keep track of my performance i am going to have to enter everything thing in my calendar into the routines bin
__label__4 very nice looking app for tracking habits and tasks have already replaced my old task app for habitnow glad you can purchase the premium version and not have to buy a subscription like many other apps are now doing i've been unable to figure out how to make tasks repeat and modify the schedule of existing habits if these capabilities don't exist would love to see these as improvements
__label__5 very useful for planning activity management of time thank u so much
__label__5 phenomenal experience it has everything i need including the ability to schedule recurring tasks which is something i was especially looking for in a to do app happily paying monthly for this it has really helped though there are other habit tracking apps that i really like right now i am also trying out their habit tracking feature
__label__5 i love this app i use it for motivation with my writing i custimized the skills characteristics achievements and my hero levels to reflect my writerly ways and it's been so fun to use watching my skills and levels increase is a blast i also appreciate the rewards options but wish i could create in app rewards for myself like potions or consumables that could increase a skill or boost xp earning for one day etc even without that though this app is amazing i highly recommend it
__label__4 overall it gets the job done but the notifications are confusing to set and are inconsistent when reminding you about your about some days i'm reminded and some i'm not so it's kinda been up to me to remind myself but the app itself is easy to use and effective at tracking
__label__2 to be honest it's a really good app it has everything simplicity system ui etc but seriously if this is really a productivity app it needs to have an offline mode does it really need to have an internet connection every time someone has to check their to do list
__label__3 we are missing a chat feature and notification when a task is changed completed modified in shared lists any do is pretty good for my personal use but even though we are both premium we don't see any possibility of interaction with the kind of interaction wunderlist provides not just tiny notification within the app
__label__2 i do not use it so i want to cancel the subscription but am unable jorte had unsubscribe within opening page unable to sign in
__label__3 have to subscribe to link to google calendars
__label__3 latest update broke google task can not synchronize try to log out and can not add google task again
__label__4 i bought the full version its a fun app to challenge yourself i would like to see an update gives you the choice to choose a pen or pencil icon or a book icon which seem to be missing that would be useful for example if you want to write a book it would be nice to have a book icon or pen icon or pencil icon update i seem them now thanks for responding and letting me know looks like i needed to scroll farther down to see them
__label__4 great idea but missing something and feels incomplete
__label__3 the new update causes forest to freeze leaving no choice but to exit the app but doing so erases the exited session please fix this asap
__label__4 i still feel like it's more complicated than necessary but it is good for special projects
__label__5 this has made my life so simpler and better amazing planner app sync across all the devices sub task can be added task can be allotted to your team this is superb they deserve much more appreciation then they get
__label__2 to be honest it's a really good app it has everything simplicity system ui etc but seriously if this is really a productivity app it needs to have an offline mode does it really need to have an internet connection every time someone has to check their to do list
__label__3 this task app is the only decent option i've found for combining tasks and calendar events into one scrollable widget tasks can be set to repeat from the date completed which is essential for things like haircuts and cleaning schedules unfortunately neither the app nor the widget which is especially important has many customization options one option i would like in particular is the ability to hide the widget's title bar obviously color and display options would be nice too
__label__3 my review might be a little skewed because i'm looking for something specific i want an app to create an hourly task today that doesn't require me to enter in a reminder for every hour in the day i don't really need a task manager because i have 3 built into other apps and i don't need a place to keep notes to be reminded about because i also have several apps that do that really i just want a flexible natural language reminder app
__label__4 well it's berfect to have so i can't miss any reminders
__label__2 while everything else about this app is good the process of scheduling a task is frustrating half of the time it fails to recognize what i'm trying to set you should just bring back the old scheduling layout from a few years ago that was easy
__label__3 something that bothered with the calendar widget is that tasks that span for multiple days are separated into blocks in contrast to a continuous line
__label__3 ok i like it but know what the experience points keep expanding but not with health simultaneously you will be sent backward everytime you lose your health while to refill health you need to max up the exp point please fix this
__label__2 it's okay
__label__5 so far so good just started using this app about a week ago it's working well and is pretty clear cut as to adding or editing the habits i like the option for reminders if it continues to work well in the next few weeks am thinking of buying premium at discounted launch price of 4 99 that describes widgets as an extra and i am just wondering what that means
__label__4 a good starter app 4 collecting the data you need to better your daily life limited flexibility in the free version but sufficient four basic tracking of self improvement efforts easy to get started and so i can do without cute reminder and encouragement features they are easy enough to toggle off
__label__1 i have wunderlist synced with my gmail account can someone explain me how to transfer my lists to this app without having to create or use a microsoft account or is simply that i'm forced to loose all my list
__label__1 приложение путает am и pm
__label__4 adding tasks from widget fails after last update when adding a task from widget goes directly to tasks list by default instedad of going to the list you are watching in the widget i prefered when the task was added to the list shown at the moment edited 2 2 2020 corrected
__label__2 technically a paid app pay for reminders ui not as attractive as related apps
__label__1 monthly payments for a todo app not gonna happen thank you
__label__3 different colors are not available for different tasks
__label__1 paid for the premium app last year now there is no history of my email address ever being registered despite me having the confirmation emails from them when i first paid for it lots of complaints on here get one of the open source habit trackers back it up yourself to cloud storage rather than spending money with devs who change the app name slightly try to charge again seen this happen so many times
__label__1 used to be my go to for my shopping list but 2 updates later it's become frustrating and wasteful as i'm going through my saved items in each category to add it back to my list the category just randomly closes and now i have to reopen it before i could just run down the list and click on what i needed to add
__label__1 i see no difference in this and google calendar
__label__3 still trying figure it out
__label__3 it's great i love it
__label__1 only 5 habits
__label__3 i wish more options be available to free version
__label__3 i'm shocked there isn't a free trial period for this app all the things that i'm looking for are premium features and aren't unlocked without a subscription as a rule i do not subscribe to anything unless i am confident it will add value a trial would help me make that assessment
__label__3 i have been using this app on my samsung for last 2 years i have found good in it it's a good app for reminders and to do list now i have changed to oppo a9 the only issue i am facing the reminders notifications which are not completed disappear from my screen in the night same day it's annoying for me because i have to find those incomplete reminders in the app one by one and set them again it would be fine if unfinished tasks should not disappear stars would be 5 thanks
__label__4 and this is definitely a good app for finding out your full day from start to finish in great detail it has some pretty nice visual effects too
__label__4 only the first event added to the calendar gets synced to the sectograph app instantly all other events takes quite a while to be synced to the app clicking manual update or relaunching the app doesn't solve the issue
__label__3 not being able to view my list of things to do or to get
__label__5 i've never been able to stick to using a to do list until now great interface and features
__label__3 after the latest update there seems to be some problem with this app sometimes when i try to press the button 'plant' nothing happens not even when i click on the 'three stripes' button then a notification will be sent telling me that the app has stopped working after reopening the app a few times the problem persisted plus after the update sometimes i can't write description about the tree that has been planted the sunflower i planted was shown in the notification but not in the app
__label__4 very good job would like option for completed habits to hide for the day and option to edit categories names icons and colours
__label__3 it is a good app
__label__4 nice tho i would like to be able to name a routine and give me a notification of the name
__label__3 the app is great but there is a one mistake there is no way to sing tasks as an unfinished tasks not deleted or compete it and the next task in repeated tasks never appear until i complete the overdue tasks
__label__4 the app is good but in the over view section even though i have focused for 45 minutes or some hour straight it always show the data as 2 different phases example 45minutes 21minute then 24 minute
__label__4 this app can save your life love how you can pin widgets to your home screen on android phones only suggestion is to add a calendar
__label__3 task repeat options are garbage for basic things it's ok but don't expect more than that
__label__3 app is good but have some error it's no refresh automatically on widget home screen we have to open app to refresh apps hour line please fix tht error
__label__3 why weekend just 2 days on sat sun but my weekend is on friday only
__label__2 ok concept but just takes way too much effort to make the core concept even work on a basic level kind of feels like this kind of an app needs some sort of ai with suggestions for every parameter and sync between different devices to get the basic functionality into usable state
__label__5 wonderful application
__label__2 this has helped me so much i love the app but i swear my coins disappear anyone else having this issue
__label__5 great list organizer i've used any do for several years and frankly i like the organization and features of microsoft to do better the only feature i miss is a total task count microsoft will likely add it in time
__label__5 absolutely love this app paid and unpaid versions worth the time
__label__3 awesome app but hate the new placement of the buttons when you use to create a task you clicked under the title to select when you wanted a reminder now it's halfway down the page i keep hitting share task and it takes forever to back out of that screen
__label__1 tried making a simple to do list was gone when i went back later
__label__2 the app is awesome but it made my phone drain 30 battery per day in the background which makes it useless
__label__2 the latest update is terrible i always organized everything by date of the reminder which is usually set on the day that it's due but now i can't even see the due date of each task i have to click on each task for the the date to appear in addition i usually organize each task by tags the date recurring if needed and other details there's no easy way to adjust all these details anymore you have to click on each separate icon to fix these to what you want i use the app begrudgingly
__label__2 several navigation options are inaccessible because they're underneath the home back tasks buttons at the bottom or within the notification notch area at the top making this app hard to use on my phone
__label__3 good app but it needs a web application
__label__2 ticktick please give us students a discount like todoist you lost a user
__label__4 good
__label__1 cancer notifications i denied the app permissions it asked for one time when trying to change the notification sound now it is impossible to change or mute the sound no matter what setting i change inside or outside the app and whether or not i give the app the permissions it wanted 4 stars when this is fixed
__label__4 good replacement app for wunderlist perhaps even better i just got it a couple of weeks ago so we shall see it's easy to use and i like the look of it
"__label__1 started my account with outlook and went to put it on my phone apparently 
forgot password so hit forgot password and it said i didn't have an account 
so i went back to my tablet and it told me the same thing i even put a pin 
in my phone and the pin was right but it had deleted everything all the 
same and told me again i didn't have an account after making another new 
one this app would be great if it didn't delete everything all the time i 
would have recommended it before all this happened but not any more"
__label__5 love it works very well and isn't inundated with ads i don't mind an ad here and there and this app has it perfected
__label__3 ok for free but limited there are better free apps i want to add details to my diy jobs such as prices links etc i want to easily share and i don't want the task to close every time i talk it trying to interact with it maybe just me but limited and a little frustrating but it's free so how can i complain
__label__3 nice app but after enabling it whenever i tried to open clock from taskbar this aap gets open instead which i don't what
__label__3 please keep a tab for accidentally deleted tasks if some 5 6 tasks gets accidentally deleted it gets very irritating to again set the tasks so it'd be a great idea to keep a recycle bin for the deleted tasks thanks
__label__1 would love this to work it says it is working ticks against my google calendars shows a few doesn't show most disappointing
__label__3 it ok gets boring after a while
__label__2 use google tasks instead
__label__5 best tasks app ever clean interface does the job perfectly
__label__4 all of the free features are really good and i am way more organized
__label__5 awesome
__label__3 there is no ability to comment like in wunderlist had to individually share all my synced lists with my husband and then he had to accept and delete all the doubles should have just been able to share links with another user
__label__5 i really like this app it pleasing on the eyes it's well designed has a lot of social features but remains simple so you can focus on your goals not running the app i would suggest to add an ability for gold that is currency only valuable to you so that your personal rewards aka don't work against playing with your avatar and currency of that kind should be able to be exchanged within party that way you and your friends can gift each other screen time or whatever
__label__2 great idea but does not give notifications for me which was really the thing i was looking for
__label__3 awesome app
__label__1 unable to open this damn thing
__label__1 too much ads appeared out of no where
__label__4 i've been using todoist premium for just over one year now i think i've tried nearly every todo app out there there has been some quirky behavior introduced over the last few months especially around rescheduled occurrences of recurring tasks and it's been a bit frustrating there but overall it's the best app for me and the team behind it seem like great people based on my interactions give it a shot
__label__5 like
__label__2 i've only just started using it and can already tell it has potential it has a simple ui but very confusing features with next to no instruction on how the features work i purchased the premium version with the hopes to organise my routines to suit my shift work but i can't find a way to automatically alternate my routine cycles if it's even possible starting the following routine cycle when the previous ends
__label__1 please make it work again the app is great but it is not working and says i'm not connected to the internet even though i have 2 available connections please fix it
__label__5 an awesome app i've never seen a daily planner like this the widget is great and its designed in such a creative and useful way easy to use excellent will keep using for daily life
__label__1 cool idea but it forces you to use google calendar
__label__5 an amazing app with a creative concept one of the best task managing apps out there
__label__2 i'm a student and was looking for something get myself very organized i have tried series of productivity apps before apparently this had one of the features i have always been looking for integration with other apps which i love two things i found disappointing features are extremely limited without premium it's almost impossible to use like that also very expensive i couldn't find statistics from totally hours and other reports
__label__4 clear and easy to use
__label__2 hard to read interface tiny font makes it such a strain no contrast option available either as far as i can tell reminder times are displayed in an even more unfriendly font not everyone has perfect vision disappointed that the creators of this app haven't thought this through
__label__4 awesome
__label__5 the greatest personal organization app i have used cool and simple user experience works on all major platforms so you can access your lists from virtually anywhere if you are looking for a way to get organized and productive this what you are looking for
__label__3 i prefer to use apps in portrait mode on my 7 inch phone tablet huawei mediapad x2 1920 1200 when the keyboard pops up while adding a task i can barely see what i'm typing because the screen height is greatly reduced in landscape
__label__4 it is a great app but still there is space for some improvement the calendar for example you have one to add more tasks other to see each specific task and the days that you did the job but note one to see the sum of all tasks you should create a resume calendar where i can see the percentage of jobs that i accomplished in each day
__label__4 figured out how to schedule reminders but it could be easier
__label__1 be aware if you purchase the paid version and then try to cancel within the 14 days trial you won't be able to they only reply once a day if you contact them and every time you contact them you have to explain that you want to cancel the service making the days passed by and after a while they just stop replying back using these shady tactics to make the 14 days goes by so you can't cancel after that this company is a joke
__label__5 i really like this app it is right there to write down reminders and if you need to write a more detailed description is easy to add addendum 3 25 2020 still happy with this app use it everyday every week right there when i need it
__label__3 first two slides doesn't load the character in character creation menu items are invisible pls fix
__label__2 having problems the app is not syncing anymore with my google calendar i double checked the settings gs and permissions and tried to force a sync still no good it is set to auto sync every 3 hours
__label__4 easy to organize
__label__2 its almost there but a bit buggy i used chrome os and chromebook the app does not handle recurring reminders properly when i mark the reminder as done it should automatically reschedule for the next occurance when i mark as 'done' the task goes away forever i contacted support and shared a video of the behavior they acknowledge a bug but that's been weeks ago i have no faith yet the recurring reminders are reliable proceed here with caution if you rely on strong reminders such as i do as you could be left hanging and missing an important task
__label__5 ever since the update to at a whitelist to allow me to use my phone apps such as google docs notepad duolingo etc it's been a lot more wonderful of an experience as someone who doesn't always have access to a laptop computer for homework love planting real trees but i do love the updates that come with more variety of our own forests so that i can have weekly themes can't wait to see more flowers as well my suggestion is a colorful bunch of lilies honeysuckles would be adorable too
__label__2 the best thing about this is that it is free no annoying ads but i get all the features some of the ux on here just isn't as good as other apps for example my day makes no sense why do i need to add everything into my day manually when it is already due today i need to click an extra button to see the tasks
__label__4 it's generally good but screen rotation doesn't work so i can't use this app upside down in galaxy tab10 if this problem isn't solved i won't pay for the next year it would be great if this problem is solved
__label__3 the app is excellent in it's working however it crashes frequently making me uninstall and reinstall it typically i think it happens if i open the app after a few days without closing it properly forcing it to go in the background
__label__2 i liked using this app but i recently noticed that important information i had saved in sub tasks has all been deleted its happened before and i thought i had made a mistake but no it's just this app malfunctioning
__label__4 for god sake change the default color this red is burning my eyes
__label__5 so much fun to use and makes me feel better about doing everything i need to
__label__3 alarms are singular and not like an alarm clock
__label__4 fantastic app but 4 stars every part has been a comfortable experience for me until i started trying to use it across devices i took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when i signed into my account for the app all the tasks i had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device it was partially my fault for the careless order that i signed in on the devices but perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if i wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again that said every other function provided is great and i would recommend
__label__4 nice
__label__5 keeps me on task and is helping me reach my goals one list at a time
__label__3 good
__label__4 awesome application
__label__5 amazing props for the design and organization tools i wouldnt change a single thing i wish there were more creator like u guys that really care and pay attention to users needs
__label__3 there's a bug preventing me to add names on tags please fix this
__label__5 going great so far
__label__5 this all is great i have downloaded and used it for 20 minutes then i bought premium for one year straight away because it worth so much things in this app and helps me alot 5 stars and reccomend it
__label__2 really 8 for a habit tracker there are other apps that do the same thing for far less money i don't mind paying for apps but this seems like price gouging oh and it's 10 if you want the ability to export your data
__label__2 dont this app have repeat task feature
__label__4 could be better if it was completely free
__label__1 too many ads and require to pay for applications that are commonly found in play store
__label__1 hey there is something wrong here the billing i signed up for was for about 2 and not 35 from my account that is my tuition upkeep fee i berely even use your app even please i need back my refund this isn't right i would file a report to google play store this is totally scammy please you guys should totally avoid this app please jesus christ i totally expected to be billed 2 all of a sudden its 35 no this is totally far frm being fair please
__label__2 reminders are kind of a core feature in a to do list app why should i have to pay for it the app is fine but i can't use the reminders
__label__1 kicks me out everytime i use it now i regret installing the new version i also don't want to uninstall as i don't think i have backup help
__label__3 i have been using it for years now but the windows version is still not as perfect as android version when i open the windows 10 version of todoist the app load takes too long
__label__2 please fix the widget it keeps failing to display tasks and asks to restart all the time
__label__2 app looks good but failed to import from wunderlist twice now forced to manually re enter several dozen tasks wunderlist works flawlessly so wondering why retire it
__label__5 i have buy pro version but it's not showing one time the yellow changes to red but after sometime it again changes to totally bad experience sorry but after few minutes only after mailing timetune they returned my money lots of love
__label__5 it very cute best app for me when i'm reading
__label__5 it is awesome definitely recommend
__label__5 i love it
__label__1 update after i read the reply i redownloaded this app waste of 4 25 it's not worth any amount of money not a lot of extras to charge money and it's only cute on a computer the lists are not very easy to make and i never did find the meal plan or journal parts the goal part is not on the app any do is free and a lot easier for lists with reminders and also includes a calendar not worth the cost yeah it's cute but not as easy to use as other free calendars pretty disappointed
__label__3 it needs to be online and the tasks are very limited response also are late
__label__3 i thought it was a really good app until today it started to crush and i couldn't do anything to backup i lost all of my options to do lists achievements don't know what should i do really disappointed auto back up should be offline too and must be selected when we start to use app or you should use your own database system to backup files not dropbox
__label__1 um you need to pay for the duration of the task no thanks i will just find a new app
__label__5 these guys rock i had to switch my rating to 5 stars since i pay for premium the app improved a lot i also tired other well known apps but i think this one is the best right now
__label__2 keep getting a pop up re authorisation failed even though my google account is already authorised on my account
__label__3 previously the best to do app by a million billion miles i have tried many other systems and this one beats all the others for sheer usability and adjustability excellent system 26 10 19 update this major update to your app is for me unfortunately counter intuitive poor and makes my life harder i like enhancements to apps but sometimes as in this case fiddling with something which was already very good is likely to make it worse many of the new features make the app worse
__label__3 would be great to have notes implement into the app that way it would be a bit more multifunctional
__label__3 not bad
__label__1 clicking the top bar on the day widget to open the standard view does not work anymore i have mine set to month and it just keeps bringing up the day everytime please fix or i will use another app
__label__5 this app is exactly what i need to to be it helps me keep track of the habits i'm trying to establish without being too intrusive i've already recommended it to a number of my friends
__label__1 demo demo not compatible with outlook
__label__1 5 up to 15 seconds are too much for staring at an add in an app that is listed under productivity already expecting the lame excuse given to all the comments please rethink if you want to go the standard way you mention or if a developer should try to give its best and attract users i'm in favour of ads in free app versions but this is too much
__label__5 colourful friendly and let me manage my homework
__label__3 great
__label__3 i love this app enough that i purchased the upgrade but it is not syncing my samsung devices to my dropbox account would be 5 stars if it did
__label__1 nice app great features good design however the pricepoint on the monthly fee is ridiculously high and is a must for core features that any to do app must do things like 'reminders' and 'labels' would try it out properly if the price was right like 1 12th of what it is now but for now it's a pass
__label__5 super useful app really nice visual way to keep track of what you're doing that you shouldn't be doing and what you're avoiding that you know you should be doing i'm using it to stop biting my nails which i've tried to stop doing for probably 15 years also keeping track of when in sticking to my sleep and diet schedule and a bunch of other habits i'm trying to establish it's important to have a way to hold yourself accountable and remember to be honest with yourself
__label__3 looks good but lack of dark mode kills it for my phone i can't stand any app that's mostly bright b white went with liferpg instead
__label__1 definitely i appropriate your hard work and this app different from all those big guys apps but question is if someone lost the phone or uninstalled the app what is the purpose this app so i'm just suggesting you can limit the how many task can be added by users without premium opt in ads for auto backup
__label__4 its a great app although it only allows me to connect to amazon alexa and not any other assistant
__label__1 this is awful bring back wunderlist you cant move your list around to the you want this is beyond frustrating not happy you are forcing us to stop wunderlist will have to investigate else where for a better list app
__label__3 i used to have 5 stars but then the layout changed and i find it incredibly difficult to organise i'll go so far as saying i hate it it's just soo much i want to have a separate view for each day not an endless scroll like some facebook timeline
__label__3 reminders should be available for all
__label__5 i love the organzation
__label__2 the idea is better than the execution buying things from the store requires you to create an account in their app rather than using the play store account creating an account requires you to enter a birthday which uses a horrible calendar form that requires you to arrow over every month in every year until you get to your birthday i'm not doing that the sound turns off randomly before the end of the session switching to another app doesn't trigger in session warning consistently
__label__5 love this app it's so easy to use it helps me be organized with the option of having multiple lists plus it's colorful
__label__2 i dislike the new update now when i have to update the time and date of a task editing and adding text doesn't work anymore i need to actually select things from the menu to change those things or even add a label the older interface was so much better that let me deal with everything by typing it out
__label__1 not user friendly at all they definitely need to work on the user experience
__label__3 can you guys implement a sound upon completing a task that'd trigger my dopamine production tremendously
__label__3 it's actually sleek beautiful well designed and exactly what i would want but without syncing it becomes much less helpful as soon as that feature is added i will reinstall this as my primary note app
__label__5 excellent app
__label__5 very good considering going premium
__label__1 the widget which is the whole reason i downloaded this app doesn't seem to be updating anymore even when i click the refresh button additionally there doesn't seem to be a way to mark a task as not completed once you've already marked it as completed
__label__3 3 app
__label__4 add notebook page
__label__3 i just started using it so i'm not sure how good it is yet i do really wish you could do bullet points like that you could check off it would be much easier in some cases than a separate sub list that is currently what i need
__label__3 the layout for the app is awesome but it would be better if non routine task can be added into the timeline with the same activity for routine task
__label__1 limited habits
__label__3 is there no way to have weekly rasks but only week days other apps have this option
__label__4 this app is very helpful but you need to control yourself to done schedule on time
__label__1 i don't get a notification or any alarm after i set the due date reminder at all i've already tried a couple of times how do i fix this my settings also allow notifications for the app also how do i set widget on home screen thanks
__label__5 to do list
__label__3 sound now works but when i have the phone's do not disturb feature on my wake up alarm task notifies but no sound i have it set to ignore do not disturb and have it set to alarm my other alarm app does sound off during this time but not as reliable as task so it's not my phone causing no sound issue what else could it be stephen you get it working and you get 4 stars restore still does not work gave up on that
__label__3 i bought this because it has a really design and features but i to uninstall it because it's slow loading it's lagging
__label__3 hi im using the paid one on my phone and ipad however i find that they do not sync well on both like i already marked 3cups of water on my phone then whem i open on ipad it's not marked but then both updated according to the ipad how do i make this better also can there be a way to skip a habit sometimes i missed it and i dont want them to keep appearing on the list
__label__2 i love this app but recently the app keeps crashing everytime i enter plus the calendar is completely wrong
__label__2 i dont liek it rlly
__label__5 this been really working well with me the community is great too it's very useful and the widget is great feature though how about costumizing the app theme like using different color theme instead of the default purple because it will look prettier for my widget d
__label__5 creative tool for getting stuff done
__label__5 love hate relationship the app is great it nags and nags and nags per your settings until you want to kill it dead and then again but it does its job the reminders are rude intrusive nagging annoying and constant but acheive your goal of reminding you to take care of things until you actually achieve items on your list i hate it but it's supreme for procrastinators busy people air heads and anyone else who needs a keeper to keep them on target phone setting dependent
__label__3 it is difficult to set an event or goal without a tutorial
__label__4 best task app i've found with reminders and a variety of tasks types keep up the good work
__label__1 does not import from wunderlist very disappointed with having to switch we've been using wunderlist for some time and it's been great and without issues now we're forced to switch over and when i follow the instructions keep getting the 'nothing to import message' this is very frustrating developers please fix asap
__label__2 after 6 years of using wunderlist the day has come to look for a new to do app microsoft to do is missing the most important feature of wl i e placing newly addly added and favourite items to the top of the to do list practically the app is useless if you have long lists with floating items i have sent them this feedback 6 months ago and they still did not change anything about this
__label__3 ticktick throws a lot of functions and features into the app almost the whole kitchen sink it has some very good and strong features specially related to reminders recurring reminders some ability to recognise natural language dates etc however it needs to improve much more in search abilites except for tags and list names search terms do not show up as you type search for tasks with multiple word combinations in the task title does not work robust solid search is still sorely lacking
__label__1 it shows you all the features very helpful and everything and as a final blow it will tell you that 24 hour widget is only available via in app purchase this is very very misleading for someone who have given their time signed in with google synced their events etc frustrated
__label__2 wunderlist was better now i have to push more buttons than before dont even know how to prioitize a task when i add it why not leave it the way it was and just brand it ms
__label__1 bought the pro version amount got deducted and programer version became accessible but after sometime its showing that i have to buy the pro version again kindly troubleshoot this problem
__label__1 when i share a list with someone over messenger or sms just the name of the list is shared not the actual list with an ability to collaborate
__label__3 good app but at present unable to add additional attendees to events as it causes the app to crash also it would be good to filter lists appearing on the calendar
__label__3 when i first downloaded this app i loved it i enjoyed being able to see my day at a glance and everything was working fine for some reason the widget will not open the app for me anymore and i have no idea how to fix it i tried to uninstall the app and install it again and it still doesn't work anybody has any suggestions i'm open to them i use an android just to clarify the app itself is still working the widget is not
__label__2 for the samsung note 9 newest os update customer service finally figured out the problem and it worked for about a month then samsung sent out a new os the reminders are firing even more randomly than before just emailed tech support again i have to say i do love the app tech support is good but response time is slow but unless developers can find away to keep it working no matter what update the phone developers come up with i may have to find a more google friendly app
__label__3 its ok notifications dont work very often
__label__5 perfect app for keeping all my tasks in order
__label__2 this app is not good if you don't buy the subscription
__label__3 try
__label__4 i came across from wunderlist and it does everything i need it to do except for one really annoying feature on wunderlist when you added a new item you had the option for it to go to the top or bottom of the list i always want my newest entries to go to the top especially in very long lists as they are the things i want to action first include a simple option to allow this and your app will do everything wunderlist did and i will be a happy man
__label__4 i love the app so i decided to install it again to keep up with school work it works amazing but my screen is very dark my phone brightness is all the way up but the app isnt bright but instead very dark this has never happened before how do i fix this
__label__4 one thing the widget sometimes doesn't update the today list and about the to do list i have to make 2 different widget for today and tommorow because when all tasks show cannot differentiate what today and tommorow so i was check list my today and tommorow task and it is kinda confusing how to uncheck again maybe this option to check and uncheck must be there and the reward will be given after all the task has done for today thank you hope this app improve
__label__2 terrible ui
__label__3 great app but tried backing up and restoring for a new phone and got a version mismatch error with no option to convert it no mention of this beforr backing up disappointing
__label__5 exactly what i was looking for needs improvement in terms of features
__label__2 premium version is too much expensive any do should provide an option in which we can select max 3 to 5 apps for integration in premium version pay accordingly
__label__5 awesome app for gamers who need motivation to get real life tasks done lol
__label__5 this is the closest app i've found since my last upgrade lost a similar app best thing about it it's very user friendly everythings right at my fingertips i'm still getting used to it but loving it so far i have only one change i'd like to see i love how i can change the arrangement in my lists could you make it so i can change the arrangement of my catagories as well thank you i hope i don't loose this one when it comes time to upgrade
__label__3 great app but as someone else mentioned there's no calendar view which for me makes it pointless real shame the search goes on
__label__4 i like this app because it's better than another app i found and is really good at reminding me to stick to schedule but i gave it four stars because even though i haven't had any issue with this yet it does have in app purchases wich i don't think are needed here but overall if you need to plan a day or routine use this app
__label__5 very helpful
__label__2 great features and easy to use but have uninstalled it as i get constant messages that it is using intensive amount of battery in the background which it is was battery life much improved with it gone such a shame
__label__2 i would've switched to ticktick but there is no option to change to a 12 hour setting from a 24 hour
__label__5 great it's a great game to motivate people to do big stuff who just keep sitting on the sofa and don't want to move thank you creaters of habitica
__label__3 on the phone it works perfectly but now that i've installed the app on the tablet i realise that it doesn't have the option to rotate the screen if the tablet is rotated please add this feature so that i can see better the tasks
__label__3 the app is excellent in it's working however it crashes frequently making me uninstall and reinstall it typically i think it happens if i open the app after a few days without closing it properly forcing it to go in the background
__label__2 syncs in seconds when using phone and desktop computer great for to do lists shopping procedures etc reminder alarm is unreliable sometimes early sometimes late and sometimes only works when phone is already awake
__label__1 this seems like a fun idea and was recommended to me as especially helpful for people with adhd so i was intrigued unfortunately i have encountered a bug where when i get to the screen where i choose my screen name and username i cannot press the next button after filling out the name and username then when i exit the app and go back to it it's the default character and i cannot customise it my account
__label__5 amazing app has everything i want from a time management app
__label__5 this app is really great the best part about it that it's connected to google calendar
__label__5 this is a great app i installed it two months ago and i use it everyday it keeps me awake to all my appointments and helps me to organize everything i recommend it to everyone
__label__3 wunderlist was more user friendly the application sticks on one screen and won't let you close out of a list i have to close out application completely
__label__3 enjoyed it's use while it lasted uninstalled now
__label__4 great app and service the user base is amazing and the staff is awesome no notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks can't read the full text of challenge tasks before joining the health experience widget doesn't display any information
__label__3 widget not working
__label__5 so far this app has been terrific with all its catagories that you can organize your tasks into it keeps it from getting cluttered and confusing so far all the alarms have been working and functioning as they are supposed to and it has been easy to use with a quick tutorial when you first open it up
__label__2 do not buy premium version app stopped synching 7 27 2019 and is no longer supported i got premium to sync to new phone since i've been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking 10 wasted very disappointing because basic version is great simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits good visuals and the ability to make notes premium tracking 5 habits and syncing across devices but no more would be 4 stars if still supported and worked
__label__4 very reliable but not great at retaining future appointments over one year they seem to disappear
__label__3 keeps either not loading the widget app and also occasionally deletes random dates impractical dunno why this is so highly rated to be honest
__label__4 so far i really like it when will the stickers and tablet features be ready
__label__3 on my s9 it's started giving notifications some minutes after the event it actually states it e g 4 minutes ago the time delay varies i hear the notifications announce on time on my huawei tablet
__label__2 every update have been a step backwards all the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so the last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly to default inbox project anymore now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project even though i just want to add quickly to the default inbox making the quick add widget useless now also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy monthly cost instead of one time
__label__5 one week of use i purchased a subscription i've used other similar apps i enjoy this the most there a few improvements needed so i need to add suggestions to the reddit page i spent time wrote out what i value in life what my aspirations are then i narrowed down a few simple goals to reach those aspirations then i added my goals to this app so far it's easy to keep track of my goals habits how i'm doing it's incredibly easy even fun to use thank you for this app
__label__1 after 3 years still does not sync with office 365 business accounts
__label__4 the apps are functioning well and recommended trying for rpg theme if you love rpg but there is a problem where sometimes when i added the task it does not appear at the task section and sometimes it becomes duplicate
__label__5 no what i mean is in the past it wasnt day 1 instead monday tuesday wednesday and etc but i'm fine with it being this way i can adapt to the problem quickly nice job this apps is worth the price been using it for 2 years
__label__5 loved the way to add due time of tasks
__label__1 no pomo time more than 1hr no whitelist available no feature for tracking task progress also add the feature to quit bad habits
__label__5 excellent app excellent widgets i use this with widget as my daily habit manager could do with an update and could have other features but what it does help maintain habit streaks it does better than any other app i've found i bought premium one off to use the apps its worth it for me don't usually buy subscriptions but a couple dollars once off worth it free to use though only widgets are premium
__label__3 works well for me and does its jobs and i never forget stuff anymore well done guys and thank you for this app jannov
__label__3 i can say this is a nice app i often see this app on so many study videos but i just start to use this app now and when i plant the tree i can still open other apps and the tree didn't die please help
__label__5 wow i really love this app such a great idea i first downloaded it for my youngest daughter to try help her with responsibility organization we connect daily on the app to check each other's progress i generally enjoy this game it is the only one have on my phone
__label__3 good but the widget glitches out atleast once a month and doesn't display the task list if that's resolved i could surely give it 5 stars
__label__3 i am not satisfied with this app because circles used for completing the habits look very dirty
__label__3 i bought the paid verison it does help us track the habits with simple yes or no questions and by answering with numbers but habits aren't as simple as it is we need other methods to track habits like options to enter time if i want to develop a habit of waking up by 7 it shouldn't be a yes or no question i should be able to enter the time track it over the month
__label__3 user friendly steps and groups are smart features options for repeat reminder are comprehensive love the colors suggestions 1 retain theme color for task so when opening planned easier to distunguish which tasks are under acads orgs etc 2 a better font style for tasks 3 planned please classify next week to specific days it will also be great if i will be able to move tasks from today to tuesday next week with a press hold and swipe automatically updates the due date
__label__3 very usable occasional technical freak outs some shortcomings in navigability and manageability
__label__3 for basic mode nothing much can set
__label__5 nice appp verry recommended make my life more organized
__label__5 this app is really unique it has made me interested again in being productive it's almost like adopting a lifestyle however the app is currently having a problem with task reminders it doesn't work most of the time and when it does the alert is usually delayed by approx 10 minutes also it would be nice if the developers provided the ability to make task lists even when offline other than that the app is perfect definitely recommend experiencing it
__label__5 best app
__label__2 this is ok for solo use but don't count on it to update between two devices my wife and i found out the hard way when i didn't get steaks at the store even manual refreshing doesn't help i googled the problem and it looks like ms todo has had similar problems for years on various platforms anyway i suggest finding another list app
__label__1 only paid one is good otherwise not so useful _
__label__2 please give us a way of disabling the red notification dot it serves no purpose if i can't tell what it's for get rid of it or make it more clear what it's indicating ux should never be an afterthought
"__label__3 it's okay application however it is not that practical reason is more 
often than not i have some event i'd like to add and shift around my 
routine this is not possible at the moment using programmer for 2 out of 
3 days is meticulous just so i can add 1 event it would be good to have 
the ability to move and split routine items with events in essence make 
programmer less of a hustle and more natural and quick to use"
__label__5 hi great app just a small thing i wish i could sync my outlook calendar but only gmail is present otherwise great
__label__1 demo demo not compatible with outlook
__label__1 used this calendar for years without any issue now ads will take over the entire screen after entering an appointment in the calendar and there is a delay before you can cancel them out terrible and disappointing choice on the part of the developers they've lost me as a user as i refuse to pay for a pro version for a simple calendar app do yourself a favor and stay away the ads suck and are annoying
__label__4 good app
__label__5 love the user experience makes it easy and fun to manage my todos
__label__2 great for neat month view unfortunately it has started notifying event reminders after the event not good
__label__1 don't use this unless you sync your tasks the backup and restore functionality from one device to the next is bad
__label__3 app is slow and unresponsive makes using it a pain
__label__2 the biggest downside of the app is that you now need a microsoft account google single sign on isn't possible
__label__1 the widget which is the whole reason i downloaded this app doesn't seem to be updating anymore even when i click the refresh button additionally there doesn't seem to be a way to mark a task as not completed once you've already marked it as completed
__label__5 although limited still useful
__label__3 overall decent functionality but clunky execution the premium version has good calendar functions but the notifications are spotty and don't work well with my phone which defeats the purpose for me the sub task feature is nice but organizing them is difficult
"__label__2 i got this thinking i could use it as a gear 2 watch face it's a cool idea 
but would be much better if i could use it on my gear 2"
__label__5 this app is just excellent a truly powerful task and project manager don't be filled by its apparent simplicity there are a lot of features and flexibility hidden in this little gem try it out what i would like added though is if the my day planning feature can be extended so i can plan for the next day not only the same day so i can populate my following day's my day view in the evening before going to bed instead of having to wait to plan on the morning only
__label__3 can you fix google fit integration use their movement points
__label__1 tells me it can't import all my data and to retry but when i retry it tells me everything is up to date and there's nothing to import of course the one list that's missing is the only one that's important i'll be trying another app thanks but no thanks
__label__2 for something that is supposed to comprehensive i am disappointed that the app lacks allowing you to set a start date end date and designate progress for tasks this app doesn't meet my needs as most of my tasks are not associated with a single date
__label__2 lots of emails notifications that you can not stop most of the features you need including seeing a completed task are all in the pro version needs payment edit after doist reply i mean the email notifications for the due jobs on the lists they keep filling my email every day and i could not stop them
__label__1 this basically is just a purple version of google calendar it has the almost exact same layout as google calendar without any extra features i wanted to use this as planner for school seperate from my calendar but there was no way to have it not sync with google don't bother getting this app just use calendar directly
__label__1 this app has started to give me full screen pop up ads
__label__3 good app
__label__2 it only works when linked to another calendar app and it's difficult to change the time from am to pm
__label__3 i had a 5 star on this but recent updates have made it far less simple to edit tasks 3x more taps first to open and then change then get out of the added window that opens also it is now impossible to select amd edit in bulk poor consideration of basic use cases on part of developers and testers
__label__1 worst app for premium only yearly pay of rs 990 no option for monthly payment bad app
__label__1 you get one star because i don't like being constantly harassed with popups asking me to rate it in an app i am paying for stop forcing automatic correction this is changing what i am typing and changes my formating make this an option to turn off
__label__3 good app and i like the setups that are already prepared for when u log in my problem with the app is that it's too overwhelming too many things to manage and for my easily distracted and anxious brain it's too much as constructive that can actually be applied please make it so the tasks actually leave the list ocne they are completed some are infinite and its difficult to focus on what needs to be done otherwise good job on this app it's well made
__label__1 if you created an account with gmail then try to sign in with google after neither of your accounts will work really
__label__1 update 2 okay i think i have figured it out the app doesn't sync with the servers on my wifi but works fine on my data connection weirdly enough the web version works on my laptop using the same wifi please fix update 1 reinstalled app apparently login with google is completely broken not working at all that's why maybe the data is not syncing original no data loads upon startup just a blank screen with 0 health 0 xp and 0 mana
__label__1 the app itself is great i used it quite regularly a few years back but when i tried to use it again it seems that the 'new' owners don't acknowledge their 'lifetime' subscription sure hope my emails get more results besides ignore kthnxbye sent an email they said they opened a ticket and then crickets nice thanks downgraded to
__label__2 a recent update broke existing home screen widgets it also made it impossible to create thin widgets the minimum width is now 4 units which basically takes up the whole screen
__label__4 i really love the app but i have one suggestion though i hope you make the trees animated so users can have a better experience and enjoy their forest more nevertheless this app is
__label__1 i had paid once for this app and had login to it now i have another mobile and want to use my acount on this device but this app asket to pay first before login should i pay each time i change my device
__label__3 decent app but not worthy of monthly fees what happened to 1x pro licenses
__label__5 it's helpful
__label__5 really helpful on the rocky journey to change your habits
__label__3 this app is awesome clean ui and great dark mode edit 6 months in and still happy mostly it would be nice to the the development team take a little more notice of the community no ifttt google assistant or wearos support wouldnt be so bad if there was an api but that doesnt exist either the developers have ignored these requests month after month for years very frustrating
__label__1 i don't know how i feel
__label__1 هذا التطبيق ما يسهلك التسجيل
__label__4 liked wunderlist better can't add more than one share i wanted family grocery list
__label__3 good app but only counts by day 5 stars if there was an option to count times a week as well
__label__4 great idea and i'm enjoying it so far chores and errands are much more fun my one gripe so far is that it seems like most items quests cost gems which are pay to play i'm afraid i'll pretty quickly run out of free items quests to strive for and then the app will lose its effectiveness it'd be helpful if their were other ways to unlock gems outside of paying for them like reaching extra high levels of productivity habit building etc
__label__3 this was the absolute best calendar app out there for anyone placing productivity at the top of the list downgrading because recently the location autofill function is not working very well i've had to rely on other calendar apps to add appointment meetings and events
__label__3 cool app but still trying it out
__label__2 i love nearly everything about this app but it eats up the battery on my phone like crazy because it is always running in the background
__label__5 this app is amazing i've always liked to create schedules to better plan my day but using other apps haven't worked out for me this app however is absolutely fantastic i love the fact that you can create your own tags for each subject and set events with reminders good work
__label__1 i remember the days when you bought an app and owned it now every developer wants to lock you into a lifetime subscription process where they can charge you for eternity i simply refuse to rent my own notepad
__label__4 alarm not working at all i have checked all settings in my phone they all are on could you please assist me on same
__label__3 very useful great clock widget with my schedule it is better if can open calendar app by touched widget
__label__3 it s a great app and works great helps me keep track of whether or not i took pills or did excercises or not however it lacks the feature of multiple times a day so if for instance a person was trying to create a habit to do something twice in one day this app won't help since you can only click that you did it once does anybody know if thier is an app that has this feature
__label__3 pls my dudes minimize number of clicks to set edit delete task's reminder time i feel like all i do is tap tap tap tap
__label__1 downloaded ticktick thought it seemed cool so signed in with google account and tried to sign up for monthly subscription kept getting error messages and it wouldn't let me start the process or even add a card waste of time
__label__2 some features widely requested and very useful are missing task with due date should automatically appear on 'my day' forward email to microsoft todo address and automatically add a task sort task by modification date the ideia is to have on top the oldest task that i've updated very important feature comments ability to make comment on the task with timestamp tags must have tags to more easily search and filter please improved microsoft todo with this features
__label__4 clever stuff great concept that is already working on me especially like the widgets they made it really functional only 4 star as the walkthrough wasnt close toenough to get to grips with the game fully i still dont actually know why my health resets or how to increase health dispite adding healthy eating and exercise it seems like there is some mechanic somewhere to battle with your guy but not explained anywhere adding in some kind of quests or mini game would be the icing on the cake
__label__3 google should make an app like this it's calendar app is not intuitive like this giving this app low partly becuz of no integration
__label__4 best productivity app i've found goal progress tracking hierarchical task management and progress reports would make it even better
__label__2 the idea behind the app is nice but it isn't userfriendly finding and adding friends to use it together was so counter productive that it got us to waste time we could be actually doing our daily tasks
__label__4 it's the perfect kind of list i've tried everything is great it could be better if we had a calendar view as well
__label__4 it is all for me about habits i wasn't able to work on it but in this one it is so helpful just i have one issue i don't know if didn't find it or it is not at the program that if u need to remind your self more than one time in the day i just remind my self once a day i don't know if it in the app or not
__label__5 cool planner visualization tool
__label__1 super cool if you're a dude and want one of the multitude of dude avatars if you're a woman i hope you want to be a nun a woman holding an umbrella over a puppy or part of a couple not even kidding definitely a guy created this app and had an all guy panel of betas
__label__5 love this app been using it for a few years i have my personal business and family calendars all in one view the widget is great for quickly viewing my agenda
__label__3 right after installing i noticed that whitelisting apps is such an important and basic feature which you made available only for premium users this is such a ridiculous decision for a google play editor's choice app that im not even gonna bother trying your app any more than 1 minute update no it's unacceptable that your development team didn't predict the flow of new installations and didn't include any kind of trial period but fine i'll up my rating to 3 neutral
__label__2 mixed great app but don't by premium won't work without play services and developer unresponsive
__label__2 as is typical for microsoft they took over a wonderful product in wunderlist screw it up and jam it down the throat of their customers the ms to do list is harder to use than wunderlist and lost some features that made it convenient to manage your tasks i am convinced ms programmers must never use their own products
__label__3 it's really motivating and would be perfect but it doesn't notif if your phone is locked you'll only know that the time is done when you check the app only then does it vibrate and notify you i've followed all the instructions but it still doesn't properly notif when locked have to look for a new app
__label__5 in my opinion it is the best app for reminders and to do i use it every day to plan and organize my day some features i constantly use are google calendar integration focus mode and priority tags the interface is also very clean great work any do team
__label__4 the percentage calculation and the number of days successful in a week month seems confusing otherwise it's a really good app
__label__4 great app i like recording tasks verbally
__label__5 awesome app very helpful for forming habbits thank you for this wonderful app
__label__4 very good app it's simple yet you can add layers to your tasks my only issue is that you need to pay for some features that are important for executing your tasks
__label__3 i really like the app but i would enjoy it more if there was the ability to manually order tasks through simple drag and drop like in liferpg also if there was a quicker way to edit like in life rpg that would be great i would be willing to pay as a way of supporting you guys but right now liferpg is more practical and they'll get my money until you catch up love the decreasing skills btw
__label__4 working excellent and it is very helpful
__label__3 keeps either not loading the widget app and also occasionally deletes random dates impractical dunno why this is so highly rated to be honest
__label__4 so close to being the perfect app 2 things needed before i switch to using it 1 add ability to edit and change habit status for previous days sometimes i don't have time or forget to update my habits on the day of 2 ability to set first day of week for calendar i prefer monday
__label__2 it's been a couple of weeks and still have not been able to share lists keep getting an error that says it's not you it's us already wrote to customer support and have not heard from them
__label__1 not easy to use horrible design
__label__2 i was about to jump wholeheartedly into using this app its integration with google calendar being exactly what i'm looking for but now i see that it has no search feature on android worse still android search has been on their roadmap since 2015 and it's still not done 2015 in the meantime other apps can build smart lists it out of tags status and free text seriously behind the curve guys
__label__2 can't drag n reorder lists on widget which is a big issue for me google assistant integration poor at best very awkward it's easily confused doesnt move tasks and generally doesn't work for me
__label__4 this app is so good it organized my life but the reminder does not work
__label__3 it show the full day events on next day actual which is incorrect otherwise it's good there should be option for alert tone
__label__5 i enjoyed using this app to stay focus the sense of achievement for getting the trees planted keeps me motivated
__label__1 worst app it crashes everytime u click on it what to do all my seeds will be gone if i uninstall it but this isn't my prob so why should i pay for it fix it i want my forest back
__label__1 only just discovered there's a bit of a sub didn't make that clear before sign up no chance its a cheek doing it sneekly you should be ashamed deleted
__label__3 this app is going in the right direction just switched from todoist i think they have to concentrate on adding more what should be standard features before adding things like hobbies etc it's ok but far from amazing in my opinion
__label__4 great honestly great way to keep track of daily tasks to stay organized one thing they should add is overall goals and tasks leading to those goals
__label__2 i couldn't restore any of my previous planted trees as the app got uninstalled due to an android technical problem very frustrating that i lost those records please advise how to restore the history
__label__2 laggiest experience ever icons were missing everywhere it seemed really cool but quite unplayable for me
__label__4 i am liking it the subscription model is a bit steep and harsh especially for the full buy out at 50 dollars a suggestion i'd like to see two categories under the skills one that says increasing and one that says decreasing i am trying to set up a daily grind negative skill that decreases will power and motivation while increasing submission and routine i've noticed the dev team is really good at responding so i am hopeful for a response thanks
__label__3 nice
__label__3 no notifications and tasks are not arranged in time orders
__label__3 nice app i just cannot work out what these random numbers are within the pieces of the pie 35 30 7 35 30 8 35 30 8 35 it is clearly a countdown of some sort but bears no relevance to anything obvious how can i remove these update to reply thank you but i am seeing 7x this info around the pie and personally it serves little use can this function be disabled
__label__4 excellent and useful i wish i had a smart watch to put it on but it's good on my phone too occasionally the widget can glitch and turn invisible but it will come back the outside clock face numbers are only black can't see them on my background and can't figure out how to change them the widget palette is great but i can imagine customization with background images of clock faces different hand shapes and or color gradients to make it look really impressive
__label__3 the guide to take the notifications off literally just shows for vivo oppo i don't even know what these are huawei and xiaomi phones there's no guide for simply android or iphone
__label__4 nice app nice design but i don't understand what is a point of notice cuz if i want to see it i need to be into the app notice need to come with notification
__label__2 too much fluff difficult to see the actual progress
__label__4 great very usefull please add fitur search to find an old note
__label__4 would be 5 stars if the list sorting had more functionality could sort by more than one criteria simultaneously but apart from that it is a very user friendly and effective tool which i use multiple times per day
__label__1 i can't get a refund and the app doesn't work google play is zero help and i can't reach a developer i've been robbed
__label__5 this app haas hekped me changed my life i definitely recommend
__label__5 i needed some help but the friendly team were quick to assist thank you guys i am really amazed at this feature rich free version this is a great quality app supplying you with a wealth of options to choose from all the power is in your hands kudos to this passionate team ten stars
__label__3 best app to mannage your time
__label__5 this aponit the best i think it's great i love how you can set tasks and reminders
__label__1 couldn't even create a log in
__label__3 okay but i wish it had options to increase exp and stays for example when you read a book gain x intuition when you run x times you gain x stamina etc etc and get rewards and level that way gives more motivation for doing those things
__label__2 can we have the lists back at the top of the page like wunderlist i don't need any of the options that take up the top half of my screen
__label__4 works pretty good to help you remember to do certain things and make them a habit encouraging to see the streak when you accomplish what you set out to do would have been a 5 but sometimes it attaches circles when a day didn't get done
__label__4 okay i think it's kinda working now but the only one suggestion i'm not sure if it's like this on every phone or just mine but i remember the old version used to automatically bring you back to the growing tree as soon as you attempt to open an app but now it only send notification preview to the notification bar instead if the developer did change it i wish they would bring the old style back i need a bit of forcing lol
__label__1 it's not working
__label__3 it's good app but it's not free if you want to add more than 5 habit
__label__5 easy to use and cross platform synching makes this app one of the best for managing to do activities
__label__3 good app that does it's supposed to wish it had some improvements to make it great suggestions in the in app forum
__label__3 hey i was very glad to use calendar 30 until now i can not edit anything if i want to delete something is reappear every time i can't move or delete if is not working i want my money back i will change the review if you solve this problem edit i will edit the review after you ll solve this problem i send it an email also
__label__3 unlock
__label__2 is a pretty good app but it's got a pretty big issue which is how is it going to keep track of how many things i've done every day if it counts the current activity as if it was done the last corresponding day
__label__2 should have choice of adding new items at top or bottom of list should have small vertical scrollbar appear when scrolling to know how long a list is like wunderlist would be nice to an option to pop an item to top or bottom of a list
__label__2 it is a good idea but it's not really easy to use in fact it's quite complicated i bought premium because they advertised i could set schedules per day and i can but not how i had hoped i recommend to make it simpler by allowing the user to toggle days per schedule in the routine editor and additionally make any small changes in each individual day
__label__1 paid premium it doesn't sync at all costumer service unresponsive for a long time don't spend money on premium this app is dead the last update was in 2018
__label__4 great app but only 5 habit is free
__label__3 the app is absolutely amazing but with the loss of the whitelist feature i can't set apps to be allowed to switch to i do not want to pay extra for a feature that used to be free especially since i use my phone for most tasks through the day and i like having the ability to allow those apps to be opened workout killing the tree also the tree dies when you get a call now or when replying to notifications which i used to be able to fix with the whitelist but i'm just left with a ton of withered trees now
__label__2 essential app i have ever installed but i couldn't set customised ringtone for notifications why
__label__3 it would be good if it had alot of tasks that are given by the app accordingly to your interest and even recommend books etc also if there was a competitive mode where you can see what level other players are and that to level up you have to do certain things that can be verified somehow for example read book requires a picture of a book with your face or run requires a tracking through the gps to actually verify yoy ran in this way it can even be competitive
__label__3 i didn't use yet
__label__3 awesome helps me to stay focused and doesn't let me to open any other app while studying but after using sometimes i can't open the app only i even restart my phone but it is not working
__label__1 it'hs just too complicate to use for me
__label__1 the pop up adverts are so loud terible
__label__3 great concept
__label__1 somehow bought it's own subscription then i had trouble cancelling was enjoying til it stole my money i never saw any payment authorization window
__label__3 i actually loooooove the app and use it to organise my life but it has now stopped updating as a widget if i make changes to my lists on the app it will not change on the widget
__label__3 can't put a recurring every x weeks on a certain day not to monday no matter what i set and save no matter if i try to modify one it is always only monday if i choose two days the second can be any other day please fix this also i can't seem to be able to modify a recurring every 2nd day of month tipe of event chain
__label__4 i still really miss being able to synch important to do's i e exams with my calendar app as i believe wunderlist was able to do besides that i'm very happy with the ease of use and functionality of this app helps me everyday
__label__4 love this app it makes viewing all my google calendars in one apot easy my only issue is entering locations because i live in a rural area and it recommends places in large cities all the time
__label__3 is not simple difficult to use try to make easyyyyyy
__label__5 needed a replacement for wunderlist looked at several disappointing options before finding ticktick it has everything i liked about wunderlist plus it has nice extras like formatting in task notes and it lacks some of wunderlist's annoying behaviors it also did the best job importing from wunderlist the best alternative to wunderlist period
__label__1 need to register immediately deleted
__label__3 clunky inflexible but does the job
__label__1 i tried adding the pro for 7 99 because i thought you could set daily reminders by just marking repeat daily it doesn't do that or any of the things i was hoping for i have had it less than 24 hours and would like a refund i have sent emails asking for help and haven't received anything back so i just want my money back and this app gone
__label__1 requires registration
__label__5 there are options to give your avatar a wheelchair and there are a lot of colors to choose from as well as a skinnier body type or a larger one i don't use a wheelchair but i just loved this option so much because i have friends who do and it really means a lot to them so cute lol
__label__3 the app works with the exception of showing all events on the app the widget show 12 9 hours ahead and 3 hours passed so when one views tomorrow's schedule in the evening the app does not show tomorrow mornings event or anything prior to 3 hours before the current time the next day a bit of a mouthful but those with full schedule will know what i mean
__label__3 good
__label__3 need ui refresh though widgets need to show text on a month view theming etc
__label__2 nothing special just a calendar app not worth the time it takes to set up clunky at best poor layout minimal instructions not intuitive to use
__label__4 extremely easy user interface helpsnin using the app more and note the goals
__label__5 this app allows me to unplug and focus on whatever else i may have going on
__label__3 overall the app does what it's supposed to do but a few quality of life features would go a long way for one a list for later this week would be nice as would the ability to nest lists more than one deep however the achilles' heel of the system is definitely its sync syncing frequently fails or takes forever and is often too slow between devices to make the most of the other capabilities of the app honestly if a better option came out i'd jump ship in a heartbeat
__label__3 hi there i am facing reminder notification issue in infinix 4 hot pro 7 0 basically i love all features of app but without reminder notification its worthless isn't it really don't wants to uninstall it so waiting for update to solve the issue
__label__4 it is a good app really ok but i don't like that you oblige me to rate this is a no go
__label__3 im only doing this because it would not stop telling me give then a rating hence the lower score pretty good app and the best part is it has a widget and only a one time fee to have full access to app
__label__3 pro version and it still won't handle the recurring tasks smoothly please fix it i've restarted my phone several times and still nothing
__label__5 wildly impressed at how much this has helped me to continue to get more organized in life as a whole not personally and at work its inexpensive for the subscription and can do so many things most of which i have yet to tap in to i feel so much more in control as this keeps everything in front of me and i k ow what i have to do and when
__label__5 i wondered about arranging the main tasks and just found the solution just needed to scroll to the bottom while in tasks i cannot say enough about how very helpful this app is i have found so many different uses for this app i am wondering about the amount of information that can be stored etc what would an upgrade include and how much would it cost
__label__3 actually a great app i'm migrating from wunderlist and i love the option to add tasks from other lists to my day and focus on just those the 3 stars are from glitches that i'm experiencing that just make it troublesome for smooth working first is the from today tray that keeps coming up endlessly needing me to force quit the app only to have it happen repeatedly secondly the widget that doesn't update either tasks i've added or tasks i've marked as completed in the app
__label__1 no hourly reminder
__label__5 simple and intuitive best to do app i've ever used
__label__1 bakwas app
__label__4 it's a lot of fun good personalization i have to make time to explore the app called more fully i think a tutorial would be amazing and pre developed lists that could be tweaked
__label__3 works great on the phone but had trouble multi tasking on my tablet the tablet version doesn't let me open a language learning app or similar apps for that matter without sending a warning message and killing my tree not fun to use when you can't do what you set out to do such a shame edit thanks for the response i reinstalled it and tried again but the app whitelist is now only with premium in the current version
__label__4 i like the app it is very practical and quick to apply but you have to purchase more targets if you want and there is no inspiring pictures i think i should pay for it too
__label__4 the apps are functioning well and recommended trying for rpg theme if you love rpg but there is a problem where sometimes when i added the task it does not appear at the task section and sometimes it becomes duplicate
__label__4 i can't sign in neither with my google account nor with gmail should i do something to be able to do that or it's just a bug
__label__1 abandoned by the devs hasn't been updated in over a year sync doesn't work at all which was its main advantage over rival apps don't waste your time
"__label__2 it sounded good so i installed it my first task is an annual subscription 
reminder this app doesn't offer an annual reminder so yet again i'd have 
to use two different apps for tasks why can't anyone get this right"
__label__3 working great so far until my nokia 8 1 was forced to upgrade to android 10 lately after the upgrade reminders no longer show in pop ups though they still appear in notifications please advise how to enable pop up reminders again thanks in advance
__label__5 it's really a good apps help me with study and stay focused
"__label__3 i'm looking for a suitable alternative to any do but this isn't it i'd 
like to be able to add tasks for tomorrow upcoming and so on 
otherwise i will have to either add each task daily or have 1 large 
overwhelming list having the option to see my tasks day by day is a huge 
stress reliever for me so unfortunately i can't choose tasks over any do 
at this time the rest of the app is great with color coding and so on i 
just really need a daily option"
__label__4 good enough
__label__3 in this free version we can add 5 habits only
"__label__3 nice app i wrote the developer and was able to get a prompt response 
unfortunately for me the backup and restore process did not work at all 
and i will be unable to actually use it i may look for another update and 
try at a later time but for now this just is not smooth enough between 
different devices for me"
__label__5 helps keep my habits in check it's nice to go back and see how i performed in months past it's kind of confusing how they display the stats but just now after a few months of use it's starting to make more sense
__label__2 it is better if don't have buy pro version hoping an app free offline soon
"__label__3 not able to sync with outlook cannot create goals with a goal tracker or 
export calendar events tasks or notes and only accessible through phone 
and tablet much improvements needed for such a high subscription rate"
__label__3 how to integrate toodledo tasks any help would be appreciated
__label__3 i liked it nic one thanks
__label__1 thee planting reminders aren't working for me for some reason i have them set and on but i don't get notifications also my trees don't wither when i go into an app that's not on my whitelist they have an advanced detection mode but sorry i don't want forest to be able to collect data on what i'm typing it includes everything but passwords even credit card numbers
__label__5 i like being able to look at my goals each day review how i am doing focus in the most important one for this month i'm seeing improvement
__label__2 just not the same open feel as wunderlist don't like it
__label__3 it is really good but the instructions are very simple i couldn't use the app to its full potential because i didn't know how
__label__3 very useful but needs dark night mode am sure that aint to hard to create
__label__2 it's too confusing
__label__5 as a teenager it is very crucial to manage time habits and tasks this is one app which allowed me to do so my saying for this app is that it would control what you do in a day by its limit
__label__4 add alarms to notification in events or tasks and allow to add ringtone on it love it
__label__5 this app is so simple yet effective i've been using it on and off for five years now and i always seem to come back to it when i really need to focus there are a couple of hiccups with the app but i've still given it five stars as these don't really take away from how great it is
__label__3 after 4 years ui seems dated
__label__5 pretty good so far it does just what i need widgets attachments small line below the main description i just miss the undo feature the free version had
__label__1 the free version has horrible ads other than that the app is marginally better than google's free calendar app that had no ads it was an easy decision to uninstall and go back to google calendar
__label__3 don't have option for windows surface pro
__label__3 it's a good start i currently have a 1 month subscription needs more habit type features needs to track display and keep a record of current and longest streaks repeat option needs much more options like 1 a way to track a task that's done a certain number of times a day like 3 times a day 2 repeat week should also have the option to have the task done a certain amount of days not just on specific days 3 achievements should have an option for completing consecutive days
__label__3 fine
__label__3 it seems like a good app but i haven't found a way to enable a permanent notification for quick task adding is it only possible edit no i mean a permanent notification that works like your widget allowing to quickly add new tasks without opening the app splendo and any do have this feature for instance
__label__4 i like this app i only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience i hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved i would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough
__label__1 subscription only no outright purchase too bad seems like a nice app
__label__5 i am loving this and plan to buy it do you intend to add a widget for phones and tablets
__label__3 i have an issue of widget stretching are there any debugs
__label__3 i was like great wit it until it erased all my schedules then like magic gave em back 4 that month
__label__1 was great at first but a new bug makes it so that every time i unlock my phone i have to press the home button twice to be able to use my phone at all i know that it is this app causing the problem as when i click on the recently used apps tab after the bug occurs this app is always the only one shown i will have to uninstall now because of this
__label__3 i liked the app well enough to pay for it so i could get my recurring items in order with it but when i set a task as recurring it only shows up on the day that i started with
__label__5 best app for reminders great interface
__label__5 i had heard good thing so i looked at it and it was so easy to store all of my plans due to the fact that i have such a busy week
__label__4 helpful
__label__2 questionable experience upgraded to premium but whatsapp integration is not working seems a little confusing
__label__2 it crashes upon opening after i updated it
__label__3 appearance good sometimes lags and don't update the time even after an hour
__label__2 app cannot keep track of an atypical everytime i set the day one it just resets after day 5 back to day one instead of skipping two days and then 2 day 1 like a normal week would work i'm deleting this app for sure
__label__1 the most complicated routine managing app ever stay away from this one
__label__2 not very intuitive i couldn't find a way to switch between week day or month views
"__label__3 it's a good app but it always need to be online to use the app most of the 
items are in app purchase"
__label__2 it was working fine until recently i bought new bush but when i have successfully planted it told me it was successful i saw it planted the last tree i had chosen on previous study session and 4 out of 7 trees were dead even tho it said i planted 7 successful trees the notification also doesn't work
__label__5 amazing app now i can easily remember every single shopping items but i can't afford premium thank you so much sir
__label__4 i bought the premium version of this app it is easy to use and i love the reminders sent to my galaxy watch to keep me on track i would like bolder colour coding to differentiate the goals being tracked and success failure indicators overall a great purchase
__label__5 i love artful agenda it is the beauty and organization of a paper planner with the convenience of being online and on my phone love the new featured that keep rolling out
__label__5 i love this app i really struggle to concentrate when i have a pile of papers to mark or some other boring stack of work and forest helps me to stay off my phone for reasonable stretches of time like i really care about my virtual forest and don't want to kill any trees so scrolling insta is just not worth it
__label__3 used to love this app but the new widget is ugly unreadable and too easy to accidentally check something i'll be looking for a replacement if this hasn't been fixed by the time my subscription runs out
__label__1 i can't get a refund and the app doesn't work google play is zero help and i can't reach a developer i've been robbed
__label__2 i like this app but it's always saying it has stopped on my phone
__label__4 very interesting application just to complicated for me
__label__3 i have peoples birthdays showing up in my phone who i don't and have never known nor have in my contacts
__label__3 as i am a regular user of this app this app needs some update like the calendar based listing method people will go to date and list the task another problem is so many color for list it's annoying who don't like colors they can select one color for every task list that is all
__label__2 it's an interesting idea but this app missed some extremely important features namely a landscape mode as well as a custom notification sound why those are extremely easy features to add my use case is placing my phone on a stand in landscape mode so i can charge it while at work i want a custom notification sound at work and i want to be able to watch the timer go down without the screen stuck in portrait also i keep the screen on and the app disses me because i have the app open
__label__4 i love this app very much but i've been having trouble recently with it after a single use it keeps shutting off by itself apparently it shows me an error that i've not downloaded the latest version of it even though i have and even after deleting and reinstalling it back it keeps glitching i don't know what to do d
__label__2 this app is an excellent idea if only it worked i have been unable to move off the home screen without it crashing its a shame as it has a lot of potential
__label__4 been using the app for half a year now it ha helped me focus on my dailies and tasks and organize myself and replace my bad habits with good ones
__label__5 its actually improved how i do things and caused me to be more active i love this app
__label__2 does not sync if i enter an item in the agenda it does not sync with the widget sometimes it takes a whole day before it is visable in the widget in the widget only 2 items are visable the rest keep saying loading for days now even if i manually sync
__label__3 it's ok but i wish i could move activities around in a routine instead of having to manually change the time one by one e g if i have yoga 9 10 then study 10 12 and want to swap them i can't just move around the blocks i have to delete study change the time of yoga then add study with the new time it's time consuming and not practical would also be good to be able to change settings of a routine e g from 4 days to 2 instead of deleting the entire routine and start over
__label__5 i have always been a paper planner girl but now that i've tried artful agenda i will never go back i love the custom covers adorable stickers and the ability to link multiple calendars together in one place it's extremely functional and i am obsessed with the fact that i can access it straight from my phone and computer too no more anxiety about losing my paper planner loving this beautiful digital way to organize
__label__4 i love this app what i liked is the alarm feature for individual list items
__label__4 the images with quotes wont change good app tho
__label__3 it would help me to better schedule my tasks if the feature to repeat a task could be made to be more fluid i e instead of only allowing users to key in every week every day etc it would be better if it allows aug 28 oct 5 nov 11
__label__1 the app has a very bad support service pretty good application however if you encounter a problem then the support will fix it very long
__label__3 was nice using the app getting used to the interface
__label__4 if only the authors would fix the issue with the wrong person displayed after clicking on the birthday box i would consider paying for the premium version
__label__4 good app but need to something more
__label__3 i'm considering uninstalling this previously wonderful app since the last update the widget has gone completely unresponsive
__label__4 i love the dynamic add button now that it's finally here in the android version
__label__5 please extend the beta program with more seats
__label__2 i love the feature where you can type the timing in the name of the task this app has great features but one thing doesnt seem to work its the reminders i'm neverrrrr of my tasks i never get the notifications i tried everything that was wriiten in the reminders not working but it still has not been fixed could u please look into it asap
"__label__3 would be great but the layout doesn't actually let you succeed in adding 
habits thus useless"
__label__3 i would continue using this app if only i was able to add attachment to the calendar from google drive ex picture or doc file
__label__3 there is a glitch in which it do not keeps track of your hours of study my target is 5 he's and if i studied for 1 hours than i add it and poof next day it shows 8930 hours
__label__5 lovely and motivate me to study
__label__5 super cute
__label__3 i used this app for a long time but now i don't know what happened the alarm doesn't ring and the notification bar isn't working the reminders don't work as well i don't know why but this app is working worst everyday
__label__3 to much time consuming and confusing features
__label__3 seems like it may be a good app but i uninstalled as soon as i found out you have to pay a monthly fee for recurring reminders which is developed once and costs nothing to maintain
__label__2 it seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all i spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and i could mark it done i try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing the icons are also not intuitive at all
__label__3 as great as this app is there is no way to turn off the annoying popups within it 'rate us' 'congrats 10 days in a row' really i can see the result please add an option to turn off all popups within the app
__label__5 does what you want exceptionally well plus the paid version enables deeper customization well worth it the free version is very useful and i do not regret paying for the premium features love it
__label__5 i have been using this app for years i can make different lists add reminders and it's very easy to use love it
__label__4 i've been using this app for about a year now i think i love keeping myself accountable and tracking what i'm doing and what i'm not each day lately i've been getting push notifications for every single message that members of my party are sending in chat none of which mention me i've switched off push notifications completely but they're still coming through all the time this is the only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars
__label__3 i've been using this app for a long time and i love it however recently it has been weirdly buggy and my trees die from things like samsung health as well as snapchat notifications even when i don't even look at them the notifications kill the tree
__label__3 too many bugs
__label__4 i liked this app i would like to recommend one more thing please add the schedule to calendar as well as right now it is getting all calendar events but it will be great if all the schedule will also get saved at calendar
__label__4 do you have plans to support office 365 and outlook calendars directly currently i am syncing my calendars to google but it's not a pleasant experience as the sync keeps failing on one or other calendar due to this reason i am stopping sectograph and moving to outlook widget for those who are on google calendar it's an excellent app and the developer support is awesome i'm rating 4 only for the dependency on google calendar
__label__3 the ui looks great love the dark theme problem is i downloaded this app because it was advertising watch compatibility in the pictures but the app is nowhere to be found on my galaxy watch active which was the only reason i chose this specific app
__label__3 took more than 3 years but they've finally managed to get bc2 to a similar perhaps even better level than the original 3 10 2019 update unfortunately usability is severely compromised busy calendars are almost unreadable unless in day view tap to create appointment can drop you in very strange time slots 10 05 or 14 40 clock to set times is backward step from bc1 which is by far the best way to set times on a calendar i like the auto link to contacts in bc2 2 line favorites bar pls
__label__3 really don't like that they changed the empty time slots back to the way they were whenever you delete an activity the activity gets replaced with an empty block separate from the empty blocks before or after it i find it to be extremely unnecessary but the new feature of increasing or decreasing an activity in 1 5 or 15 minute chunks is great and the programmer feature works well as always particularly good for planning out studies and work
__label__5 any do does it right light where it needs to be light strong where it needs to be strong a delight to use
__label__4 very nice app for productivity my favorite feature is that tasks and dailies that are finished can he hidden however it requires connection too much wouldn't mind syncing from time to time but i'd really hope there could be a way to tick off tasks even offline also would love to see weeklies or something that doesn't reset everyday for goals like go to gym 3x this week or walk dogs 5x this week integration of calendar events would also be nice
__label__2 the most recent update just made it harder to move times around
__label__3 there wasn't a synchronization between the app and outlook mail calendar
__label__5 i love this app so much it has really helped me get into a morning and night time routine before i found this app i was always late for school and felt really unhealthy in myself but now i'm i'm always early for school and make sure i wake up every morning at the right time thank you to this app so much
__label__1 super cool if you're a dude and want one of the multitude of dude avatars if you're a woman i hope you want to be a nun a woman holding an umbrella over a puppy or part of a couple not even kidding definitely a guy created this app and had an all guy panel of betas
__label__5 good app to organise school projects and plans
__label__5 love this app it has really helped improve my productivity
__label__1 amazingly useful app with horrible glitches every week when all checked tasks become undone and overdue and default calendar changed by itself
__label__2 ads just too many
__label__3 must have this app
__label__1 unusable without an account even when i'm not interested in any of the cloud features
__label__3 phone samsung galaxy j7 star i just started using the app i'll upgrade or downgrade accordingly
__label__3 love the app bt still some feature like temporary modification if somebody is late then adjustment is required and please add tasker integration for advance options if you can people will ready to pay for tasker plugin support also
__label__2 it doesn't allow the ability to automatically set reminders when creating a new event i use both the google calendar app and business cal pro and they both allow the ability to automatically set reminders and yes i have this setting enabled in my google calendar web settings this is an important feature that's missing
__label__3 stupid decision to remove timer
__label__2 edit even just an option for the horizontal interface would be great thank you for taking my review into consideration please please please bring back the old horizontal interface or at least have an option for it i used to absolutely love this app and would have rated it 5 stars anyday but now i find it quite useless i understand how it could work for some people but it's definitely not working for everyone as i've seen in other reviews
__label__4 i use it a lot and it really helps with my concentration the timer is slightly slower than actual time though so if you want to know the exact time you worked for check your clock before and after
__label__5 this is a perfect app for tracking and building habits
__label__2 new update has lost the ability to click on the widget and open the list full screen the font is smaller and ticking off an item on the widget has became more difficult please fix five stars otherwise
__label__5 really user friendly effective in keeping track of your habits and achieving your goals 100 recommend
__label__3 it crossed my mind to buy the full version but then i saw they want a monthly payment why not just make it 5 lifetime seems like a good app not sure who copied who with liferpg seems too similar
__label__3 this app is absolutely amazing and helps a lot during exams but after a while it starts crashing and i lose the previous history and the trees i get using the coins that is really disappointing this has happened more than thrice kindly look into it other than that it really does keep one focused
__label__2 the main feature does not work it doesn't remind me about todo with system notification
__label__4 it's helpful but it's also annoying edit i didn't make it clear enough it's annoying to realize how much i'm failing lol anyway the app is pretty good i'm just overly sensitive and self criritcal
__label__4 it's been a good way to get things done and the concept of an rpg is very well executed the reason for 4 out of 5 is simply regarding the interface my wife uses it on ios and it is light years beyond what we have on android much cleaner more useful information and less clunkiness
__label__4 it was very useful for me to plan my days until the latest update which the widget shows the wrong day and i am unable switch the day
__label__3 i uninstalled because the app was a little confusing it has a great idea and all bit i just didnt quite get how to use it
"__label__3 i like it a lot but i think it needs a way to tell what day you're in it 
does ask if you did things yesterday but i sometimes get reminders for 
things on the wrong days it's still a very good resource"
__label__5 at first it appears cluttered but it won't take you very long to figure it out and by then you'll love it
__label__1 y bhko
__label__4 i love this app it helped me improve my lifestyle nd made me a better more mature version of myself the only gripe is that plz allow us to whitelist some apps like i know it's there in the premium version but at least allow like two three apps to be whitelisted that would help us so much
__label__3 so as huge fan of wunderlist i was devastated to hear that it was going to cease along comes to do so most of it works similar to wunderlist which is good but there's little things i just don't like for example when tapping on a list boxes are too big and in your face text too big also main screen is ok when ticking something off on a list how about something to divide to do and done from that list instead of everything together give us more customisation options for sizes colours etc
__label__2 love this app but it needs to stop crashing constantly after every update figure it out and i'll change the review
__label__3 good but not ok
__label__4 it is a pretty nice app i really like it but why don't you you make the delete completed tasks button is it something too difficult if this function will not appear in the nearest updates i will change the app for sure
__label__3 i like this app but it's so buggy it has a lot of throttling while using calendar sync please fix this a i tried to log out and reconnect this doesn't work calendar part is still buggy the calendar only works well when i turn sync or calendar permission off but i can't see calendar events in this case
__label__5 wonderful reminder app and brilliant community
__label__2 برنامه ی خیلی خوبیه از همشون بهتره ولی جا داره ک بهترم بشه
__label__2 it could be a very useful app but it is not very intuitive why should i set up the date in google calendar and not directly in the app
__label__2 it's slow it'll be better if it works offline
__label__2 the application is very nive but cant take the complete use of it because of the premium option and the amount also is high
__label__4 there are some things i feel need to be ironed out e g i found feeding the pets mounts a bit buggy but overall it has definitely helped me think more about my personal goals and how to approach them
__label__3 this application is very good feature rich and most powerful even though you should add few features in the app 1 repeat frequency should have hourly and 30 minutes 2 add bullet points format in the notes section like google keep have 3 provide database backup option with google drive and dropbox
__label__4 awesome
__label__3 not able to show the notification after the time is up also it is not able to function well on counting the exceeded time or shown incorrectly it would be of great help if you could fix the problems thank you
__label__4 i love this app so much i've had it for almost a week and i've only found one bad thing about it it's absolutely adorable and it's helped me stay off my phone and make it fun to do so the problem i've had is that when i get video chat requests from instagram my trees die but i fixed it by muting video chat requests overall it's super fun
__label__3 just changed phone didn't keep anything from my premium account can't even create a new account without erasing current data 2 for that inconvenience has helped me tremendously develop new habits ui is perfect the app and widgets allow quick and easy habit tracking counting habits are useful but it would be great to be able to see near misses in order to track improvement better customization of the interval chosen to calculate percentages would be very helpful
__label__4 nice there is all i needed in this app
__label__4 i like the app it is very practical and quick to apply but you have to purchase more targets if you want and there is no inspiring pictures i think i should pay for it too
__label__5 it does what is it says love this app would there be more features like history and analytics about habits and routines etc
__label__3 i love this app and use it with my watch but have been having a few problems firstly i purchased the pro version off of my main google account but the app is connecting to the other google account i have on my phone i dont want to purchase pro a second time and the only way that i have found to disconnect it from that second account is by removing that account from my phone secondly since daylight saving my events have been an hour off until i sync my events will change if probs are fixed
__label__3 shows monthly when startup even after changing it in the settings to show weekly otherwise all around good app
__label__5 very useful
__label__3 overall alot of features can make the app more organise using colors cannot find way to export when switching phone
__label__3 this app stops the alarm i set after the while and then this is the 3rd time this has happened otherwise it's the best
__label__5 it's perfect application i love it
__label__2 i'm going to start by saying who segments their hours on a clock into fifths that's not standard and just annoying second why can't i add events from the app it always redirects to google calendar so what is this app even good for i'll just use my calendar and it will be easier
__label__5 the best to do app ever now i don't forget any important things on my mind i can write or record at anytime or anywhere thanks ms
__label__5 i was looking for an app that let me make todo lists for my lazy self that met the following criteria 1 something that looked decent 2 something that let me set reminders in case i needed it 3 something that's quick easy and intuitive to use this app is all of the above and more i'm speechless from how amazingly simple and nice looking the app is i love being able to set custom colors if only i could have it on my computer too maybe widgets in the future well done steve
__label__3 good app
__label__3 i am so confused
__label__5 great app
__label__3 font is too small you have to open it up each time you want to glance at your appointments
__label__1 spamming me to rate well here you go
__label__4 how do i add my agenda on the widget
__label__3 bought the pro a few years ago however recently went to a new phone and now i'm seeing ads and it doesnt look like i have the pro version anymore not sure what happened but jacked up that i paid for the pro and unable to get the functionality of the pro version without buying it again
__label__5 i never thought i could switch to a digital planner and yet here i am my husband is so happy to see everything that used to take him time sifting through my calendar we're all synced up on google calendar now and i have the beautiful version for me to see on artful agenda with the lists i need to run my box and family
__label__3 the concept is inventive but the execution simply makes this app less than enticing to use
__label__2 does not sync
__label__3 so so not as intuitive right off but fine after a little of fiddling around but the free version only tracks 5 habits and i dont love it enough to see the value in paying for it since there are other apps out there that satisfy the same thing
__label__4 this app is great i love the idea of turning my daily life like an rpg game but i have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing so can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed been trying my hardest to do this on your app even finished reading the user guide but it still wouldn't work
__label__3 good but very confusing it was good if i knew how to use it the whole set up was very confusing and hard to understand i really hope in the future it becomes simpler
__label__3 there is scope of improvement to make it easier
__label__1 excellent ui easy to use and sync to gmail events and tasks all at once since the last update on feb 13 2020 this app shows video ad after modify calendar which you cannot close until the ad is finished you have to be careful if you are in quiet environment ie meetings
__label__5 love it
__label__3 i like the app and it works to improve my productivity but the notifications almost never show up and the whitelist mode doesn't work sometimes i wish there was a way to change the ground color for the day week month and it's quite annoying that the flowers are as big as trees
__label__3 i loved this app but recently since 31st december 2018 the chains are no longer being made even though i'm meeting the criteria for the habit my streaks have been reset at 0 even though my score has stayed at 100 very confusing and annoying any help would be greatly appreciated
__label__3 premium is subscription based thays a huge deal breaker for a todo program just saying
__label__1 premium version only
__label__3 hi we migrated our lists from wunderlist we use shared list but now even we shared the lists that were previously shared they do not sync so other people don't see the completed items if they assign a task they can't see it completed there are duplicate lists with the same name one is shared the other one is not when creating new shared lists the people who received the invitation are unable to join they see an error list unavailable i tried support but unavailable
__label__3 loving it but are there themes on the horizon not a huge fan on purple and where can see a weekly monthly summary of how i'm keeping up with my dailies also i noticed a bug when i accidentally hit 'create' multiple times for a new daily it will create multiple instances of it
"__label__3 i love the idea of this app is quite unique in the way it visually shows 
my upcoming events sadly try as i might i can't get it to refresh 
correctly with my calendar its always wing despite following all the steps"
__label__3 the sync feature doesn't work
__label__5 loved it awesome for making habbits best app for monitering ur tasks and daily routine thanks habitnow
__label__1 it's not free
__label__3 only been using for 3 days easy to use
__label__3 would love the calender to automatically fill in details of invitations and interested or going to an event
__label__3 in beta test have a many bug for example when i starts my day in my hp is lost i die agian and agian i lost my exp i lost my sword
__label__3 i do like this widget a lot however i left two stars blank for very specific features first and most importantly i left a star empty for the ability to display battery status on the widget as i use this as my primary smartwatch face thus without this feature it is very hard for me to see the status of my battery at a glance and know when i should try to get a little bit of charging the second feature is integration with outlook calendar without asking for permission for the entire account if it needs to ask for permissions at all as my workplace has very high security requirements for each of these features implemented i will add another star
__label__2 latest update has not fixes bugs that occur every day frustrating to use sometimes it won't save will just have a loading loop some basic things are not customizable like the calendar starting on monday or the date format doesn't keep track of activity data correctly please focus on getting the app to work instead of focusing on superficial appearance was thinking of paying for a subscription but what's the point if the money will not go towards making the app usable less temperamental
__label__4 great app for planning the missing 5th star is because the reminders are restricted and not personalizable if you want to be reminded at a specific hour of the day you can't
__label__4 good hard to change times
__label__2 reminder didnt work on vivo
__label__4 love this app so much it's helped me so much over th years to get university work and school work down but i do wish that trees didn't cost as much
__label__3 what i'm looking for is scheduling calls not just typing call so and so but click on call button and my contacts would pop up to choose from when you have this i'll gladly pay a fee and will be strong proponent of the app
__label__3 i like the idea but does no one else have serious concerns about privacy yes the required permission to monitor your usage of other apps seems reasonably well motivated by the stated purpose of classifying your phone usage as focused vs unfocused phone but on further consideration that' actually a ton of information to sign away in exchange for growing some digital trees i'll just stick to a simple timed alarm until i see some assurance that our usage data isn't being sold to 3rd parties
__label__3 an ok but expensive app
__label__2 when adding a task it transferring you to google calendar then after adding the event it doesn't appear on the widget
__label__5 great app just having it on your home screen helps you stay focused because you want to use it every time you see it
"__label__3 no actually i do have a sony xperia phone and time tune doesn't ring on 
time and it only runs when i open my phone i mean how to activate 
notification when it's also off"
__label__3 i am facing sync issues yesterday i added a todo from my laptop chrome website today i didn't get it's notification on my phone it's when i opened the app when i see that it's being added this should have been done in the background
__label__5 i love it exactly what i was looking for for a loong time i've used it as my main home screen widget for over a year now synced with my daily schedule set up in google calendar i recommend the 24h layout
__label__4 good app just wish you were able to back date a completed task so i can use it for tracking habits as well but it's a to do list app and works well
__label__4 it's very nice but how to get time line on home screen
__label__5 bought premium exactly what i was looking for amazing job and what i need to help me in life giving it 5 stars even though i have one suggestion possibly have it where you can have a single habit occur twice like say example i want work out but i want to work out at 3pm and 7pm i saw another app have it but still this one is best hands down
__label__2 i try signing up logging in even with facebook and still won't even let me in
__label__3 i wanted to try out and see how it suits me but when i was adjusting the start and end of the day it appears that the end of the day is not beyond 2400 ppl like me who sleep in the middle of the morning bcos of work tends to end work like 2 or 3am especially across different timezones if that's fixed i would be glad to pay for the app
__label__2 worse than wunderlist no drag and drop of tasks and a poor selection of themes weekly view should allow segmentation by day instead of lumping five days together
__label__3 asks for a subscription to get all the features i'd pay a one time fee only guess you don't want my money bad enough edit yes i know which is why you got a negative review i like your app i don't like paying subs i raised u to 3 stars for taking this so we'll all to often devs get all butt hurt add a feature to buy a lifetime license even if it's 20 dollars and i'll buy it or give us an option to see ads without a sub at least cheers do this than 5 stars
__label__5 my planner system is now complete i love the web app and now with the mobile app my on the go planning is also on point the app is fast beautiful and a perfect planning companion awesome
"__label__1 started my account with outlook and went to put it on my phone apparently 
forgot password so hit forgot password and it said i didn't have an account 
so i went back to my tablet and it told me the same thing i even put a pin 
in my phone and the pin was right but it had deleted everything all the 
same and told me again i didn't have an account after making another new 
one this app would be great if it didn't delete everything all the time i 
would have recommended it before all this happened but not any more"
__label__5 it's a good app it fuses the entertainment received in playing games with finishing chores which is pretty hard to pull off i'll recommend it to anybody who's trying a lot to change their life but easily succumbs to their desires
__label__2 it seems like this app is no longer supported i've paid for premium but sync stopped working several months ago and developers have not replied to a support request so on moving to a new phone my habits and streaks are now lost i can see from other reviews that this is a widely reported issue i guess the app has now been abandoned
__label__2 the alarm feature does not work which leads to missing the tasks
__label__3 sometimes quits as it starts
__label__3 would be awesome except when i put start in weekly view in the settings i can no longer access monthly view or change the settings
__label__5 reached to my satisfaction
__label__1 despite having given all the access required it just doesn't work wanted to use the app but just couldn't because the tree doesn't die and it doesn't stop me from using other apps so the purpose is defeated uninstalling sadly
__label__4 can i have your email please
__label__2 i didn't know how to do anything
__label__5 its being punctual for others and very productive app much recommendeddddd
__label__1 pay
__label__2 stopped working after a week
__label__1 apps that cost should be required to disclose how much these cost up front so people can decide if they even want to download it we shouldn't have to hunt for the cost
__label__1 seems a good app but can't use the basic functions without paying for premium eg can't have a reminder at a certain time of day without premium surely the basic function of a reminder app is reminders on a certain day or time premium is 36 so expensive loads of free alternatives out there
__label__2 the app looks interesting but it didn't work in my device which is a samsung galaxy note9 i couldn't see the introduction and i couldn't see my character in the character creation window it kept saying path profile file is needed i don't know how to fix it
__label__2 i don't get this app
__label__1 video ads
__label__1 paid for premium does not sync
__label__3 ça fait le job sans plus l'ergonomie n'est pas des plus brillante
__label__2 not so good
__label__3 reduced one star because there is a pro version 5 stars rated when there is another pros version it cant be right reduced for another star because i suggest that you should have a 'pause session' check it out from the study bunny
__label__2 i upgraded to pro after a couple of weeks initially excited about the app having used it for a while now i'm starting to regret my purchase there are some pros but more cons it's buggy doesn't sync well at all across devices the ui is very cluttered the forum needs serious updating a search tool for eg the last update was ages ago given how pricey this is you'd think the developers would make it worth it but they seem to have disappeared
__label__2 i can't cancel my subscription how can i do that
__label__1 uninstalled as calendar events keep appearing under the wrong date disappointing
__label__5 well design useful and easy to use
__label__1 not really functional
__label__3 i loved to use this app until the grocery category just vanished list and all it's gone and i can't retrieve it that organized grocery list was the best thing about this app how can i get this category back
__label__3 the program is really awesome but i'm using the oppo f7 and it doesn't do any notification i followed a guide but it didn't help that's the programs only problem
__label__2 there is no sound
__label__1 great idea but doesn't show all events for the day doesn't show events in designated colours all look the same doesn't show repeat events no use really i'm removing it from my phone
__label__4 the free version is very good so far most features are free ive only used a week but if this app continues to be as useful i'll consider premium soon
__label__4 very useful syncs with calendar and lets you easily see upcoming events and tasks
__label__4 google assistant reminders do not populate will this be addressed soon
__label__5 absolutely amazing the only planner app i can actually successfully use i'm really bad with these and my brain seems to like this one's straightforward interface
__label__2 the new interface is cluttered and hard to use edited in response to the query below in the older interface a routine had a separate page for each day of the week now it's a continuous scroll the older approach seems cleaner
__label__5 it's been great a great to do list app
__label__3 great pomodorro like method for staying on task with a built in reward whitelisting was free at first they should've kept it free and added other desireable features they could've offered at a price
__label__3 i really like the app maybe just work on improving the graphs a bit more
__label__5 nice
__label__3 missing basics clearing the completed tasks is like erasing history instead of having the completed task stack up and encumber the whiteboard each one of thr completed tasks should appear on the calendar as completed or as initiated on completed on in gantt chart format this is really basic guys
__label__3 not so great add birthdays and they disappear as soon as i save used to love it now looking for another love
__label__3 not sure yet still testing it
__label__3 gd
__label__3 the ability to add due dates and times to sub tasks is a crucial feature that's missing other than that the app is great 5 stars when this feature is rolled out
__label__3 those dots on the right of each item are gone how do you reorder your to do items now
__label__5 this app is the best thing ever first i had the task list from 2010 and i was organising my life and my work and i thought it was the best until the new updates and i could not use it anymore and i was so sad but now i found tasks which is 10 time better and i am only 4 hous on it thanks again for the creator and the team great work
__label__5 i used this app many years ago but i can't remember why i stopped using it whatever the reason was they must have improved a lot because i'm loving the app now never been so productive
__label__2 app works good but with the latest update 25 seconds of ad for adding an appointment not recommended after the update
__label__5 i really enjoy this app it's a fun satisfying way to keep track of time and stay off my phone for a while
__label__2 need wifi data for it i get that you can play with your friends but it would be nice if i could use it without wifi for data anyway i have a limited ammout of data and brain memory so by the time i get home after all day i've forgotten my habits and the point becomes mute only gave this an extra star because i love the 8 bit art
__label__5 great have no issues recommend to all
__label__4 i like the design
__label__4 i love the basic version it really helps me stay organized
__label__3 this is one of the better habit tracker app ive tried a couple of them i deleted after a few days just because they were so basic yet had the audacity to charge for a premium service habitica seems to be much more realistic and actually has a more detailed u i for setting yourself different kinds of targets habits but i would like to give this app 5 once they link this app to your clock and calendar apps or build in add more notification controls looking forwards to updates tbc
__label__2 i like how its organized and how many choices and the customization but i set alarms and keep in mind i have all permissions on and it didnt go on my screen so i missed a very important meeting
__label__3 gamification is good designed but the app works kind of laggy 5 star when redesigned
__label__2 i've been trying to figure out how to have a custom time set for the add notification options and there doesn't seem to be any way for example i need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes but there's no option for that we need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want instead of only having presets edit now after using it for a while the app has been plagued with reliability issues it often is late with the notification by a few minutes or the service completely stops and i'd have to restart the service due to this issue i cannot rely on this app for anything that is time sensitive because i'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs i've contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven't been able to fix the issue
__label__3 i like this app but in the world of time schedule management you have to be multi platform i would recommend that your next step in development is a web interface as the majority of a professionals day is spent on a pc or laptop
__label__4 complete a tip the task option directly reduces the characteristics rather than just the ability
__label__4 so far so good
__label__3 i like the idea but does no one else have serious concerns about privacy yes the required permission to monitor your usage of other apps seems reasonably well motivated by the stated purpose of classifying your phone usage as focused vs unfocused phone but on further consideration that' actually a ton of information to sign away in exchange for growing some digital trees i'll just stick to a simple timed alarm until i see some assurance that our usage data isn't being sold to 3rd parties
__label__2 i do not use it so i want to cancel the subscription but am unable jorte had unsubscribe within opening page unable to sign in
__label__3 i like the app but why a habit is limited to once a day there's no habit twice a day or more i can't understand
__label__5 in love with this app i use it everyday all the time i have bad memory so this app always helps me at keeping track of things
__label__5 i like it what i would really like to be able to do with it is to set it on my homepage to where as soon as i open my phone my schedule is right there in place of my clock food for thought thanks edit wow thanks developer responded to my query within hours changed from 4 to 5
__label__3 i like this app but i want to make it where i can make it a daily a routine so the due date should also have time
__label__2 recurence tasks does not work properly otherwise i would give 4 starts
__label__5 love it exactly what i was looking for nice looking very functional and it can go on my homescreen with check boxes 10 10
__label__3 the app itself is fine but the widget is spotty greetings shows my tasks and other times does not no real rhyme or reason to why the tasks won't show
__label__1 i hate companies that make you needlessly create accounts have a 1 star review as payment for my distaste
__label__1 always missing the notifications even when it is not optimized and restricted in background
__label__2 wunderlist has a date time stamp on comments when the list was imported the date time stamp is no longer available
__label__4 love it so far i would like to be able to move appointments around on the same day for example they are listed in the order you enter them but i want my am on the top of each page and my p m appointments in the afternoon on the month view it would be great if you can just drag and drop i also would like a printing feature for my lists so that i can actually print them out while packing
__label__4 as someone with adhd organizational tools are a necessity and this is one of the best i say that having tried just about every well rated organizational app in the app store that said this is obviously still in development the web version is missing many important aspects however new features are coming out regularly and the team is very responsive once a few more features are up to par namely the website and the smart lists i'll be changing this to a 5 star reveiw and paying for pro
__label__1 bhai very very very very bad asp
__label__2 this app was everything i needed i loved it but after thenlast update i cannot log in to my account so i cannot see my daily schedule will not trust it again and i have already unistalled it i need an organizing app which i can trust fortunately all the events were synced to my google calendar but notes and tasks didnt so i dont know if i am forgeting something that is pending now
__label__2 not a great user interface have been using for almost 2 months but still struggling
__label__3 lots of unnecessary notifications the gui is confusing and is missing a few features for a habit tracking app like splurging only every x days but no less
__label__3 the app keeps crashing every day and wouldn't open every morning i got to reinstall it and log in again what's wrong
__label__3 every time you ask me to rate it my review goes down a star stop asking me to rate it i already have
__label__5 nice app
__label__1 i was unable to understand anything this app is a big mess
__label__3 i love this app however i sent the link to several friends and they got the app and i received no premium time whatsoever don't be dishonest with your apps that's lame
__label__3 the concept is quite elligant yet also hard and confusing to understand it would be eaier if there was a calendar setting and or addition to help the user plan along with a timeline
__label__4 great to do app seemless integration with windows would love to see the option to open the mobile app with the my day tab already open
__label__2 looks really good but i'm not going to pay a subscription for it sorry if you said one off payment then maybe most of the locked features are available in other products out there
__label__4 nice format views and options my only suggestion is to improve the options that can be assigned when creating a new event
__label__3 you should put in the description that the widgets monthly weekly and even daily calanders are for premium users that's the main reason why i downloaded if you don't have the money for a subscription its just a checklist which can be done on most defualt phone calander apps
__label__3 please fix app cannot refresh once again for the second time topics pic quote
__label__1 doesn't allow you to unsubscribe from premium and the developers don't even respond whether on email or twitter
__label__3 good idea but there is on reapeat routine i have to add evertime so make me hang more and its work only 12 hours basis
__label__1 app has many bugs 1 start screen doesn't display first 3 slides user creating is totally not functional i'm using both android 9 and android 10 same bugs
__label__2 good
__label__3 it's a nice app it make my life displined
__label__5 love this app the template feature for take and events saves me do much time i also love the ability to view calendars and groups on the fly as well as zoom in and out to view a customized number of days great app
__label__2 no habits library
__label__3 im sure the pro version is great but it didn't keep my interest long enough
__label__3 is there a way to see less weeks in month widget 6 weeks is too much for my taste 4 would be more ideal
__label__2 too much fluff difficult to see the actual progress
__label__3 cannot see events on calender only dots need prettier colors themes for women
__label__5 easy to use
__label__5 excellent application best calendar i've tried
__label__3 long time user do not like the latest changes changing the location of the remind feature is very frustrating now i keep clicking on the wrong option because it is in the same place as the remind feature used to be please change back
__label__3 there are much more eady to do list apps this one is not intuitive and no time to waste searching maybe could be interesting after getting used to it
__label__2 not sure what the point is when you can still access any app without interrupting your trees as long as you leave this running in the background note the lock forest to stay in foreground option is selected
__label__3 it's good but i don't like how it makes me feel bad for how unproductive i am but that's just me nothing against the program
__label__3 for anyone who wants to manually order your list just long press the task and drag drop it it's really easy my 3 out of 5 is because the widget seems broken i have a large 3 x 3 widget to see my planned tasks the list randomly disappears in the widget open the app and it's still there go to the widget it's still missing randomly it comes back if this gets fixed it'll be 5 of 5
__label__4 works very well and is easy to use
__label__1 app was good in past but not anymore it has stopped sync and many bugs creeped in due to no maintenance and update since as per details in app page last update was on 28th jun 2018 but still it is the first thing that comes in results when i search for habit i guess google should stop advertising an app that is not managed since years
__label__5 great
__label__4 turn life into a game create your own tasks and assign value to them pretty cool eh
__label__1 i wanted a to do list this is not such continually asking to name things unnecessarily complicated kiss
__label__3 sync between gcal was so bad that i wasted plenty of time waiting to add a single task for almost half a year it worked fairly nice but that problems with sync today was enough to lose any trust for keeping important task on that platform
__label__3 i hate the checkbox so much please make an option to remove them totally ruined the old nice swiping experience
__label__2 i like this app this is a wonderful app i can focus on my studies because of this app
__label__3 why its so hard to sync
__label__5 i'm on the quest of improving myself developing small good habits is pretty easy with this and using this app as a reminder for tasks is awesome
__label__1 this app doesn't let me log in to my previous account once i skipped the initial registration page due to some network issues i tried logging in but it only shows sign up or connect to facebook which i definitely don't want to use when i use my previous account on sign up it tells me that the email is already taken please fix this issue
__label__3 was really looking for an app that lets me have multiple repeats for a task within the same day everyday duplicating a task multiple times and then making those into subtasks seems to be the only way but it clutters up the task list like 8 lines so i'm reminded to drink 8 glasses of water and then subtasks show up twice in the daily list both within and outside of the main task i thought the repeat every 1 day 8 times custom setting might work but it's a different function
__label__3 est ce que vous avez une version de business calendar pour les laptop
"__label__3 app is good but have some bugs notification changes automatically to 
default after some time"
__label__4 great app to be focused
__label__1 the good simplistic ui one may or may not like this the bad google authentication is buggy had to it thrice the ugly doesn't allow one to export import data
__label__5 if you want a digital checklist to keep you on top of your life then this is the app to use
__label__1 ensure you read the comments re payment every critical comment is true and this app just isn't worth what you're charged i recommend you beware
__label__5 very useful app
__label__1 too useless
__label__4 handy habit helper
__label__3 any plans of allowing sub tasks to show up in the widget
__label__5 very helpful to have reminders and important details at your fingertips i wish there was a way to have it synch with an app or program on your computer
__label__4 great however marking down one star as can't find a way to edit frequency of habit once you've saved it have to delete and recreate habit with new frequency
__label__2 checked is again as they are killing wunderlist still lacking so many basic features really lame why can't i manualy change the order of the tasks like in wunderlist where are the completed tasks where are the deleted tasks why are new items always added to the bottom
__label__5 was initially sad that wunderlist got shut down but so happy to have discovered todoist instead i like it even better it is smart but also simple and not overwhelming wonderfully designed
__label__4 it's ok i guess not much different than many other calendar apps still getting used to it
__label__5 the best calendar ever i like the way that tasks are included
__label__1 updating my previous review i recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits yet the app only shows me of having 30 days this is the same bug i reported last year it appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the new year i've reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone i'm giving up on this app and suggest you do too i've used this for a couple of years there was a bug where one week of my tracking wasn't recognized by the app this happened the week of new years i reached out to the developer five times about it and never heard back unfortunately this has become an unreliable app for tracking
__label__3 great app i only have one complaint the tavern system doesn't work i went on vacation and knew i wouldn't be able to complete my dailies or even open the app for that matter so i entered the tavern thinking i was safe for the couple weeks i'd be gone i just reopened the app and it told me i had died twice took all of my gold two of my items and decreased two levels honestly considering deleting the app now as i had over 100 gold saved and lost a piece of rare equipment
__label__3 no to do hstoryi tracking
__label__5 really good i usually forget my duties and this app really notificate me and make me do them with some xp hahahaha
__label__1 cannot drag and drop the task too bad
__label__5 this app has greatly helped me in creating better study habits and eliminating procrastination i'm a high school senior for reference part of the reason is because rather than simply completely blocking usage of apps it allows you to choose to break your streak forcing you to actually consider the consequences of procrastinating my only gripe is that i feel like the ability to whitelist apps should be free although it is only around 3 which isn't bad i'd recommend it to anyone
__label__2 doesn't sync properly anymore have been using the free version of this calendar app with my google calendar for years without problems but for the last half year or so the appointments don't sync the invites don't get sent it has become unusable and unreliable i have had to switch to the google calendar app now
__label__3 well this is awkward but i cant even find widget option for this app in phone downloaded just an hour ago so this has to be the latest version i believe the whole purpose was to have a clock on my homescreen that has my calender synced it doesnt seem to that may be i'm missing something here i'll definite give an update of this review if i can figured it out
__label__5 great app
__label__2 the interface is ok but ticktick does not sync with google tasks you can import google tasks but no tasks added in ticktick app will appear on google calendar if a task list doesn't integrate with google tasks if i am limited to using the standalone app and cannot see tasks on other devices computers then the task mgmt app isn't really good for anything
"__label__3 i love this app buuuut there's a lot of small simple things that can be 
added to the actual organization system that can make it much more 
effective on people for now bigger concerns please allow task and 
etc making setting marking and etc to be allowed to be done offline 
it's worth it and will be effective trust me when making tasks and all 
that good stuff there's an option to have a start date this does nothing 
i suggest that this should let the said task or etc to only show up on the 
date you stated or have a tag you can activate to show it or at least not 
turn red or damage you until the start date of your choice or just some 
concept of long term task setting please when i try to make a party in 
the mobile app it directs me to a window in chrome that then tells me to 
use the mobile app really love this best of wishes in developing"
__label__1 impossible to register circle circle circle and nothing
__label__5 awesome app
__label__3 it's very nice i would definitely buy the premium version if it was one time payment but they ask monthly subscription
__label__1 i recently switched over from the original business calendar app which i have been using for many years this version has a fancier ui but functionally seems much the same as far as the calendar goes which is fine if it ain't broke don't fix it i think other features have been added but i don't really use them update full screen ads suck they appear and cannot be closed for a long time show me an ad if you must but let me close it the free version is unusable this
__label__3 didn't realize this synced to my outlook calendar started deleting work stuff and deleted two important appointments from my work calender i'm screwed on those was planning on using this for personal use only
__label__5 would pay for this if there were even more additions and updates absolutely love it and wish they would develop it even further
__label__4 clean os lots of features
__label__3 would give 5 stars but locking the aync function through a subscription sucks
__label__3 even though you don't get full access for free this app still helps you a lot with habits you want to change it's just an organizing tool to motivate you to keep going worth a try
__label__3 i love the app except that the widget does not remember customizations such as default calendar not using 24 hour time if this could be more flexible and keep the settings of the apps i would definitely rate five stars it's helped save time having multiple uses for one app but i need the widget compatibility
__label__1 how does this app have such a high rating you have to pay to get reminders what a joke going back to any do
__label__3 i wanted to play with it for a few minutes before putting in my payment info i realize i can cancel but would prefer to do a quick test first i
__label__4 love the look of this agenda list feature is great way to track complete to do lists
__label__4 very useful app for establishing good habits i like the weekly view in particular also like being able to set the level of chatter and reminders done to the minimum in the free version
__label__5 cool
__label__3 i loved the look of this widget and can see the potential but it made my phone completely crash turning itself off and constantly trying to turn on but would only stay on for 2 minutes i had to delete it please help me so this doesn't happen because i would love to be able to use this
__label__3 i need more time with your app i'm looking for an organizing app to meet the needs of me and my gaming community to be able to cross schedule events share valuable information w aarach while i know that was never your vision i am impressed with the very easy to use ui but have not figured out if u can share projects notes calandars ect i cam see your app meeting a very large need in a community the desperately needs an easy way to collaborate adding a group's feature to cross plan 5 stars
__label__3 had a great experience when i was using it thru browser but when i installed it on my phone it wouldnt record all my progress and tasks on my phone application even with the same account please work it out i would love to keep using thru my phone
__label__2 two stars because facebook login is not fixed for an year is this application still supported by the dev team
__label__3 a bit disappointed bought a new phone and re download ed the app would not bring my calander in from my old phone and asking me to repay for the full version
__label__5 so good free version
__label__2 was a great app but could not login since last month so bye bye planner pro
__label__2 if the change log doesn't change why would there be another pushed update which causes the date of latest update available to change i don't understand why you wouldnt want to distinguish that part of the update is new and part is older as you say for instance 'ui improvements' and 'add another widget option' instead of having description basically unchanged
__label__5 amazing its fantastic to have a visualization of what my day is it keeps me on track
__label__1 the tree store does not work please fix other than that great app does what it intends to do
__label__3 why can't you add an attachment
__label__3 wish i could add events without having anything to do with google calendar
__label__1 abandoned by the devs hasn't been updated in over a year sync doesn't work at all which was its main advantage over rival apps don't waste your time
__label__4 have difficulty trying to set multiple appts for the same time on different days too complicated just want to input what days of the week i want the appt for
__label__3 it was ok but only the first instance of the recurring events shows up on the list calendar it is important to see how recurring events impact the schedules in the future so users can avoid scheduling something on those dates times
__label__1 i did the free trial this planner does not have push notifications you can set up your events and appointments even make them reoccurring but artful agenda app will not remind you or notify you what good is a digital planner if it does not have push notifications if i am going to pay for an app it should at least have most of the features a free app has
__label__3 i cannot add invitees u less they are in my contacts and sometimes not then either
__label__3 not bad
__label__3 i have enough credit but i can't purchase for premium
__label__5 fabulous best calendar app out there so easy to sort all your appts and the various ways to view make it super simple to stay organized
__label__3 repetitive tasks by completion date buggy been reporting it since 2017jan21 0759 hrs mt one rely asking how i sent in the concern which i tried to reply to and can't since then nothing great app terrible customer service
__label__5 gooood
__label__4 this app is very helpful but you need to control yourself to done schedule on time
__label__4 the app is great but the notifications are not working please do help with this issue
__label__3 good
__label__1 this app is a piece of sh it won't sync my old wunderlists shared lists don't work i'll be uninstalling and going with a different app thanks microsoft for taking a fantastic app wunderlist and ruining it
__label__4 really good i cannot believe my eyes my eyes
__label__1 notifications werent appearing constantly waste of time
__label__1 wunderlist was better microsoft bought it and killed it first microsoft forced me to switch apps now i have to have two accounts since i have lists at both home and work that i share with others pretty dumb otherwise the app is wunderlist waste of time to have to redo everything
__label__4 i just downloaded this the free version was definitely useful but i went ahead and got the paid version because i wanted to use the repetitive tasks and weekly planner as well i definitely think this will be worth the purchase
__label__2 by default before the current update was rolled out tasks were set to the date 'today' now they are being set to feb 1 3880 how weird
__label__1 1 tips on how to study efficiently and effectively 2 before planting a tree add a button wherein you should finalize the tag that is set 3 if the tag is changed during the planting process it should reflect separately the time spent by the previous tag as well as that of the new tag so that the overall distribution is at its peak accuracy will put 5 stars afterwards
__label__4 this app is so good it organized my life but the reminder does not work
__label__1 it's pure discriminating to have to buy an extension to be able to use 24 hour mode either make it free or let everyone pay for the app i would love to try this app because it really looks like it has a really nice concept but since the devs choose to make just some people pay for it then i'll gladly give it a bad review instead
__label__4 i decided to update my review because the tick tick team doesn't want to implement such a simple feature as 2af protection many users asked then since 2018 but they use the same excuse every time our dev team hasn't such plan in my for this year hello it is 2020 the application that stores so much sensitive data there must be 2fa
__label__3 i don't know why but there aren't any notifications it never shows anything let it be reminder or routine
__label__4 how to change letter style can't read sub titles with double lines
__label__5 i love it
__label__5 with the short period of time i've used this app i have enjoyed it the app has been a great tool to help my keep track of my 2018 goals and stay on top of new habits i am trying to create to better myself and future it has a clean ui although i wish it had more theme options this app has been great at motivation on days o have slacked off or days i messed up with its visual aid on my progress for 2019 i would recommend it to someone trying to create a better habits
__label__2 needs all the sorting options on the widget that wunderlist has i specially miss the week setting also colour coding of overdue dates on the planned widget setting is missing also missing numbers on the drop down menu of the list so you can't see how many listings are in each category with overdue listed too there will raise to 5 stars once that is fixed
__label__5 i'm obsessed with this app i love that you can make separate checklists for different types of tasks i love having the ability to categorize my tasks chores so i don't end up getting overwhelmed by the long list not only that but you can sort your lists by due date priority or in alphabetical order and set tasks to repeat on certain days of the week instead of every so many days the widgets are gorgeous and it's so easy to use the checklists without opening the app i've never been so on top of things oh and the calendar links to google so i don't ever have to worry about losing or transferring events this app is exactly what i've been looking for i'm so glad i finally found it
__label__3 so disappointed to lose everything i didn't realize the app didn't save your lists got a new phone and everything transferred but because this app doesn't have you log in everything is gone i had several important lists saved to prepare for my upcoming baby and it's all gone i'll never remember it all time to look for something else to use response from the main screen i didn't see any prompting so did not know i was supposed to or how to
__label__4 i've been wanting a habit tracker that is fun and this definitely is there are a few loading issues every so often if those bugs weren't there i'd give 5 stars all around though enjoyable easy to use and a great way to keep track of good and bad habits
__label__5 it really helps you get focused on your priorities and do your job
__label__3 enjoying the app so far but the widgets are quite limiting you cannot use check lists in the widgets and sometimes they update rather weirdly i have also had ui bugs throughout but they haven't affected me too much overall good but just needs some tweaking to make it more solid that's not to say the service is bad just the mobile app
__label__2 i used to really love this app as it provides a todo list widget that can show a lot of todo list items compacted into a very small space however it has started showing full screen ads when adding new items so i'm going to be looking for a replacement
__label__1 the website works but the app is blank
__label__3 waste of time dont download
__label__2 getting annoying reminder keep jumping out although the task is set one month later start looking for alternatives
__label__4 i like it so far
__label__1 i was really excited about the whole idea of this app but theres this huge down side that i cant accept i hate how the whitelist option to use your apps without killing your trees is only if you pay money which is ridiculously frustrating because i have 5 specific apps i need as an artist and use on a daily basis i was looking forward to planting my forest while working on my pictures but no disappointing that one specific feature should absolutely be on the standard app option
__label__5 excellent calendar app the best
__label__2 you should have name to change date with yesterday today tomorrow not number on widget view
__label__4 best watch once you understand it it takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually get it but once you do it does exactly what it promises its sleek yet informative and by far the best at a glance app for your homescreen the watch addon is the cherry on the cake only improvement in my opinion would be to add multiple different widgets like give me the option for a small simple one on my home screen and a bigger more detailed one on my office screen for instance
__label__5 i use it for keeping track of tasks after i complete them i don't want a reminder of a task i just need to keep track of it this app allows me to disable reminders keeping track of them is as easy as checking off the day it has the days circled based on how you schedule your tasks the user experience is really easy you can create multiple tasks or habits to be schedule them separately and keep track of them on one home page it shows you stats etc to see your progress those for whom the reminders cause unnecessary stress i e workout reminders this app is better than calendar scheduling
__label__4 please add a feature like task has to be divided based on categories inside planned and importent list
__label__1 blank screens when initially launching character creation screen missing most assets but still semi functional unable to begin oneplus 6t a10
__label__2 i logged in with facebook i upgraded to the pro version checked the planner a day later and had to log in again now it says to upgrade to the pro version again and if i click it play says i'm already subscribed to it
__label__1 the problem i have is that if i set a habit to be every monday and wednesday for example and i follow it successfully for a few weeks then if i just want to change the days it discards all my previous progress which is stupid i just changed the days and the app can't understand this
__label__4 tasks todo is a work in progress nevertheless it is very handy and i am happy to have it i'm a former wunderlist user i believe the app developer will continue to tweak tasks todo not that it's not helpful now i do miss the deleted items not being hidden under the category of tasks they came from this was very handy for shopping especially groceries other places i shop for i could peruse my completed list for things i may have forgotten thanks so much continue the good work
__label__3 good app for setting daily tasks if it had hourly reminders alarms it would be great for me being notified by alarm makes up for it though as most just have short notification sounds that i never hear
__label__4 it is so good if thtere is alarm it will be better
__label__2 what happened to all those data i had not able to log also
__label__1 broken so far not impressed i bought this expecting multi device sync and haven't seen it do that it wouldn't even restore a backed up file after logging off then on
__label__3 this app has done a good job of helping me keep track of tasks dailies habits and the to do with checklists have been wonderful i just don't like the new redesign nothing looks to be where it should be to me it now feels bulky and clunky and i feel like it will make me use it a lot less because it is now uncomfortable to look at
__label__4 so far so good i've only used the app for about a week i'll write a more in depth review soon
__label__4 i like this app but i dont understand why i cant set up tasks that repeat unless they're habits or edit the categories a habit is something you want to always do i want to plan reoccurring tasks that are temporary
__label__4 it's a nice planner i just prefer a different layout i also don't care for the color
__label__5 it's really a nice app
"__label__2 this app was amazing when i first started using it now it duplicates tasks 
too much i have about 20 of the same task for each day and it takes 
forever for me to delete the extra tasks"
__label__2 it is not what i want
__label__5 have had this app for sometime and find it does everything i need both as a retail manager and my home life able to customize to suit individual needs no hesitation in recommending
__label__1 it used to be the best calendar for many years till now when annoying advertisements are popping up all the time so sad but it's totally intolerable need to uninstall and find another app
__label__4 i liked it but once i got it i saw a had no need for it and i felt like i don't need it as much as others
__label__2 from all possible options i've tried out this has most awkward and unintuitive interface
__label__4 just downloaded the app loving the idea of adding my own habits to do stuff which i used to tick off daily on notepad uff now i am glad its automated with rewards too yay have a suggestion to make all sections of list tabs movable up down like the rewards section to organise as per customisable preference
__label__5 i really appreciate the format of this one i just wish i could color code without paying extra
__label__1 подписка на полгода пропала сразу же после переустановки приложения
__label__3 i wanted to like it i've always drooled at the idea of having a to do list app integrate with a calender but alas this version is clunky you can't delete a single date of a recurring calender event meaning you can't flexibly plan your day while beginning with a rough outline i switched over to to doist and google calender instead
__label__1 was 5 stars lowering to 2 so hopefully they see this make the completed tasks section it's own thing again why would i want it merged with my existing tasks makes it very hard to find accidentally closed tasks or to look thru historical data dont think this change was necessary
__label__3 easy to use
__label__4 i'd assume the preferred behavior is for user to focus for longer periods than shorter periods but the rewards are exact opposite i 6 coins for two 10 minute sessions but only 5 for one 20 minute session your point system must change
__label__4 nice app but not able to use widget nokia 2 1 android pie
__label__3 edited review
__label__3 good
__label__3 i currently use wunderlist to organize all my tasks it would be nice to have integration with their software because g tasks is so bare bones also because of the limitations of the free software i can't tell if the full version would integrate into my workflow because this app prohibits use of projects
__label__2 price is very high for indian users we don't get 1 10 of what a us citizen gets paid here so there app subscriptions at such prices don't make a sense
__label__2 this was ok for a few days but now when i open it it is just a blank screen and i have lost all my tasks very annoying as these were important reminders
__label__4 very good
__label__3 works pretty good so far
__label__5 so far a little lonely but really fun it really is like playing a game i almost have enough to buy a real sword
__label__1 lots of bugs no support can't share like wunderlist don't open an app that's not ready terrible microsoft quit buying good apps and ruining them and taking the support away
__label__3 too much complex
__label__2 great app in the beginning but once you start skipping days the notifications become insulting shaming words for example calling me a couch potato which i am not so dumb what expert would ever say that insults are motivational almost none i'd rather use an app based on the principle of kindness not shaming
__label__4 it's probably the closest app to what i'm looking for i'd really like to be able to either style or disable monochrome mode and have the option to use the same style between the watch face and home widget so i don't have to go back and forth in the settings to make them match
__label__3 a little confusing at first but it transfers your calendar and alarms to the app one bad part is it adds everything on your calendar like if you add eat breakfast it'll go on your calendar so that's only a little annoying since my calendar needs to be clear and easy to read but besides that it works well
__label__1 too expensive
__label__3 happy with the app but personally i had two issues which are if addressed may provide sort of convienience to the users 1 if any task is not completed and deleted by mistake it can't be undone that i felt inconvenient to write the task again 2 if any task is being feeded and there also undo redo options are not available
__label__1 i like what its trying to do and want to use it but it's missing a few things to do doesn't support formatting at all mobile or pc and any formatting you do in outlook is erased and spacing is messed up to do has the ability to create subtasks but doesn't translate over to outlook the to do app on pc doesn't allow you to enlarge the task note window so your forced to type in this little box on the side of the window please fix these
__label__3 is it true that non premium version soon will loose any way for backup restore or transfer to another phone if not true please point to me what is the backup restore way that stays in app in the future thanks a lot if true that is really bad news backup is a basic necessity so non premium version will become practically useless on the long term in addition premium costs twice as much for a single year than let's say osmand for eternity and that is a much more complex app the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits tasks is a really nice app except that swichingt between sublists lists is unreasonably slow with some unique and essential features but this wracks it it will drive me away possibly others too not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that response to steven nottage's response that is fair enough except for one important detail all the people using your free app are now forced to decide if they want to have a meaningful app to pay or search for another app premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities if you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing people will buy it lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay i payed for a number of apps all cheaper than yours btw and actually my plan was to pay donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear because i thought the app is really useful and it deserves support this change is different i do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc just that you should not remove the free local backup or any other feature or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start best wishes response to steven nottage's second response actually you can clearly see from my review that i do not want everything for free my problem is different if we could not understand each other so far perhaps it's not worth trying any more so i won't comment on the rest of your answer all the best
__label__4 definetly a 4 star good app good concepts some bugs not really pulling me in thou i forgot about it which was sort of the point of the app to make me not forget it so 4 stars
__label__3 idea is cool not for everyone i'm removing 1 star for not having any charts for the habits themselves and 1 star for the funky behavior of tasks screen i'd edit some task from dailies and after it's saved i'm placed back to habits for example
"__label__4 this app would be so much more useful to me if i could order tasks by time 
hope you guys can fix this thank you great app good job"
__label__2 trying to switch from wunderlist and the import option doesn't work or give any assistance to troubleshoot i just get the message file not found with nothing else to say where it's looking for the file so i can get it in the right place
__label__3 still testing
__label__2 good
__label__5 i use the app daily for routine planning and habit tracking multi device app with constant improvements by the developer the app keeps on getting better
__label__5 i have used for 3 or so years it has served me well so far so far it is one of very few apps that has never crashed the so far is murphy's law
__label__5 sweet app super clean interface simple and straightforward me likey
__label__1 could be better pls fix the 'repeat' setting where i could accually pick the exact date and time for example i have to study during mondays tuesdays and fridays at 8 pm the app isn't very specific about it deeming it useless to me hoping for a better update
__label__3 i'm liking it but it seems to have some bugs it's currently 01 13am but the widget and app are still showing yesterday's calendar sectors and event list
__label__2 so you tell me to pay every month for same functionality in premium no still doing normal in everything else
__label__3 اغلب الميزات الهامة مدفوعة
__label__2 i like the idea but it's not working with outlook calendar properly this a big drawback for me
__label__5 any do has helped me significantly in my day the app allows you to have control of your plans events and tasks
__label__4 it's okay i just really hope it would let you do more for free i know it's 95 free but i like to repeat some tasks for a week i am not saying it is bad it's an excellent app
__label__3 good
__label__1 my phone is a samsung s8 the introduction screen is mostly blank and the character customization seems to be broken because your character and customization options don't show up i didnt go any further
__label__3 user interface is really a big putoff
__label__4 app is great helps me keep track of my daily habits i like how the interface is simple and easy to use however i've been experiencing issues tracking my habits using the widget
__label__1 really unimpressed that i cannot get notifications unless i subscribe to premium i can set up memos on my google calendar be reminded for free why would i pay for that with an app without notifications i'll have to remember to check what needs done where i'm at etc i also found it difficult to figure out how to navigate use what little was included in the free version gave up in frustration when i realized that to be actually useful i'd have to pay extra
__label__5 best reminder app
__label__4 expensive
__label__3 must have this app
__label__3 this app was a life saver for me but its not working properly with my new oneplus 7 it doesn't gives reminders which i set for whatever time i get it once in a while but most of the time no reminder please provide a solution for this asap thanks edit 7 7 it started working now all i did was in the battery settings selected any do app n selected the option dont optimize in it
__label__5 great app it really helps me stay organized
__label__3 no matter what i do even setting 'no notifications' when creating event or task they continually pop up not happy with this feature
__label__5 easy to use set up a lot of goals easy to track
__label__3 not really an exciting app
__label__2 the app does not sync our shared lists
__label__3 has potential but the interface isnt user friendly at all
__label__5 ace i love it
__label__5 a simple app to help you put the phone down and feel accomplished
__label__3 its great productivity app but not the one that motivates me or to fun to use personally the game theme is cool but not the one i like i like the original task apps better with all neat features since this one doesn't really have any
__label__3 its ok i haven't been able to figure out how to get reminds
__label__4 app has definitely improved since my last review more social features would be really cool i am subscribed and i would love to see where this app takes off i have noticed recent stability issues when i'm on the app for a prolonged period not sure if it's related to the amount of tasks i have as i use this app for basically all my tasks including birthdays the app will slow down and nearly crash after awhile otherwise this is still my go to 4 stars again
__label__3 i am having a hard time with adding events on days different than today this should be easier to use
__label__5 if possible please add more advanced equipments and more powerful bosses so that it does not get boring after sometime there is no purpose to collect pets if they are only for cosmetic purpose there should be some reward that we can identify ourselves with for example there can be a weekly ranking system say from 1 10000 for all the habiticans so they are more motivated
__label__1 the old version was good and interesting but in the latest version it needs money for unlocking each and everything
__label__3 many critical bugs that don't get fixed within a long period of time also many times doesn't sync changes to specific calendar or changes on one event out of a series of events
__label__2 this app worked well for a year had ads but i was fine with that the latest update made the ads much bigger appearing in the task sidebar instead of banners at the top and bottom i was annoyed but tolerated it then today i got a full screen video add that i couldn't close until it was through that's too much deleted reply to reply i know i can pay to get them removed but i don't want to support a company that pushes an update with full screen video ads you can't close
__label__4 i find it's useful and easy to check
__label__5 great smart looking app it has help me improve my hardwork sometimes in a day you wish someone could remind you of what to do but guess you might have no one it has been helpful to me thanks a lot guy
__label__5 a great idea and an entertaining design
__label__2 they fixed the crashing issue awesome my impression of the app was 5 stars after that what brings me back though is the latest gui change to the widget 2 stars now they took away the ability to easily select multiple tasks i am considering switching task managers now i do not see a way to restore the old functionality also i used to be able to launch todoist from the widget that button is gone now too i am a long time user i've reached the enlightened rating on the app boo
__label__3 really amazing but there are pop up adverts if you're not a member and for someone like me that's quite a few adverts daily very annoying but everything else is perfect fyi the designers have to eat so i'm not mad but god damn that's annoying would be really cool if you could at least watch a bunch of adverts at once so you don't have to do it later just an idea id be up for
__label__3 there's a bug preventing me to add names on tags please fix this
__label__2 app is very good for what it is but the sync feature stopped working for me the faq says it's due to a rooted phone but this happened twice on non rooted phones habitbull offers no support to fix 2 stars bec it works standalone but if you need syncing know there's a risk of permanent failure
__label__1 date no time
__label__3 excellent app with plenty of functionality for free users and worthy upgrades for paid users i love that it can be used across multiple platforms that being said it's super unreliable so i'd never upgrade repeated tasks sometimes get marked off and stay on the current day needing to be marked completed as many as 5 7x before moving to the next day sometimes when you add a task it'll disappear maybe related to server syncing but not always so you better remember defeats the purpose
__label__4 great app life changing if used properly easy to use i have paid for premium but not getting my reminders popping up with notifications for app on can you help
__label__5 it's a cool app i have enjoyed using it
__label__5 ok i love the app it's great but the notifications just doesn't work they are broken and it's the main feature i'm looking for fix it in order to give you the five starts
__label__2 themes and location based reminders are under subscription both are free on most of apps like this thanks but no i'll pass and keep using google keep
__label__4 so helpful
__label__4 its great app it should be complete free but of course nor maybe few updates than i'll rate 5
__label__2 i uninstalled the app because it sends my phone info to the developer
__label__1 unfortunately i can not sign up or sign in by google account or email i tried a lot from iran
__label__4 this is wonderful but i really need to be able to use it offline as well
__label__4 overall great app love it
__label__3 some privacy please why do you millennials think everything needs to be shared why can't i keep my activity private without sharing with entire world
__label__1 do not install this app i used to love it but in the most recent update the advertisements have made it absolutely unusable i am switching to google calendar and never looking back
__label__4 the app is good but in the over view section even though i have focused for 45 minutes or some hour straight it always show the data as 2 different phases example 45minutes 21minute then 24 minute
__label__4 was using contacts but ran out of space with an upgraded version so without warning it stopped saving contacts poor idea found business call 2 pro am still discovering new features amazing app
__label__5 i have been using this calendar for years and have decided to upgrade partially to support the developers and partially for the additional functionality i have no intention on ever switching my calendar application
__label__1 way worse than wunderlist they overcomplicated the interface and they got rid of the ability to type things such as get groceries tomorrow and have it automatically detect the due date nice job
__label__5 this app has helped me develop and stick to many useful habits highly recommend it to anyone who wants to develop a new habit but is finding it difficult
__label__4 amazing helps manage your time and habit formation
__label__3 is good standalone but outlook integration is confusing and ineffective i have to use onenote as my todo at work
__label__4
__label__4 great honestly great way to keep track of daily tasks to stay organized one thing they should add is overall goals and tasks leading to those goals
__label__5 perfect app has really helped me focus on college work or even getting off my phone for a break only thing i could ask for would be more options for the sounds ambiance tab
__label__4 it's a great app keep up the good work it has almost all features i've ever wished for in gamification but a few things were missing quite annoying for me and lead me to abandon this app for now if it helps you i could write you a comprehensive list of enhancements and features that i think could make this app better here's not enough space for that though please give a short answer of you'd like me to send you an email with the list of my thoughts
__label__3 i loved this app when i used it 2 years ago but can i no longer log in
__label__1 lnot friendly interface
__label__5 generally stable very few issues and does all i need
__label__3 bit complicated in adding routines i didn't understood
__label__1 if you use gmail calendar go with google tasks free with much more functions and integrated with your calendar events reminder tasks without subscription stick with the big guys waste of time with this app
__label__3 this app is useful but it would be so much more useful if you could set a routine to be repeated every weekday weekend day week 2week 4week month etc it is badly in need of this feature i thought buying pro would allow me to do this and it hasn't helped at all and i'm disappointed i spent the money please say that it is an upcoming feature resetting routines for every day is really inconvenient
__label__3 they need money for whitelist and great feature which is not good although its great app
__label__4 i wish i could control the reminders for my tasks more like the volume or what noise it makes other that that the app is great for keeping track of things that need to be done
__label__2 allowed all the permissions for this app but i still can't get the reminder to work on my smartphone running android 8 downloaded a different reminder app and also allowed all permissions for it and it worked well
__label__3 nice and simple task app however it is missing a couple of key features that are preventing me from switching over fun my current task app these are 1 no ability to set multiple reminders 2 cannot hide tasks until a later date for annual tasks i do not wish to see them constantly in my to do list i'd like them hidden until a certain date usually 1 month before due date furthermore due to the longevity of the task i like to be reminded early and then again closer to the time
__label__4 it's a good app and being able to route alerts through different sound channels is a great idea i've found a bug though and couldn't find a way to contact you about it besides here it's daylight savings today and while timetune has the correct time for some reason it has pushed forward all my events by one hour so an event which says it is happening at 6 30 is now on my timeline as 7 30 hopefully its just for today
__label__5 my planner system is now complete i love the web app and now with the mobile app my on the go planning is also on point the app is fast beautiful and a perfect planning companion awesome
__label__1 doesn't save my timeline have to redo my while schedule now
__label__3 good app but once i swipe the application from recent applications the purpose of the application fails following which i can access all the applications without effecting my forest also an option to arrange my trees would be really nice to see
__label__4 good but it an be better if we can add contact no also
__label__4 i love the app it's a great way to stay focused especially with all the quarantining going on however i have one issue with this app the ambient noises you can play don't loop properly and become glitchy if you let them play for too long
__label__4 best list app on this app store
__label__4 great but can be annoying with notifications and also is not quite as customizable as i'd like definitely helps to track your habbita though
__label__3 i really like the paid version of the app the only request i would have is i use this app for pomodoro 25 min bursts during the work week and i miss having the full tree image is there a settings option to change this
__label__3 good app but in free version they should add more features just like reminder with time duration i like it's feature of description in which we can add sub task and tick then
__label__1 keeps saying something wrong with my microsoft account this really sucks wunderlist was so easy
"__label__2 i paid for the subscription but can not use the recurring function i tried 
to make a task for monthly use and it does not show up on the other months 
ahead"
__label__2 worked well for a few days and then just stopped sending reminders the reminders would pop up if i opened the app myself but that's obviously not the point of a reminder also froze a lot pretty much useless when it worked it was excellent
__label__2 app is unable to manage recurring tasks app has almost everything but it fails on managing recurring task after setting the task to be of repeat type marking task completed for a specific day is marking entire task as completed and for this only reason i had to uninstall please make necessary changes and inform
__label__3 please tell me how to undo an accidentally added habit i feel like i'm cheating when i delete and re add a whole habit because it's bugging me otherwise the app is a gem 3 stars till you fix this for me it still doesn't work i don't want to delete a task i want to unclick a habit because i've accidentally clicked positive negative and i can't undo it even if i click the other one to make it even it just registers it as a separate log
__label__4 very good and gets the job done not the prettiest or well designed but certainly not the worst it's exactly how it's pictured and works fabulously too no crashing or issues here
__label__3 i just started using this app my week actually starts with saturdays while only sundays and mondays are mentioned if you could modify this detail that'd be really appreciated
"__label__3 it's really good i would appreciate it even better if i could save tasks 
offline"
__label__3 there's a bug where i can't add tasks from the widget tasks only get added if i actually open the app pixel 3a also items get added to the bottom of the list by default what the hell microsoft
__label__3 i like it a lot and also not a lot i like the way it looks once the tasks are created but i dislike creating the tasks using the current interface 4 comments 1 i have the full version with whatsapp linked and it causes duplicate reminders 2 the widgets are not recognized by my homescreen replacement app go launcher 3 i would like to be able to resize the fonts and spacing 4 creating tasks via whatsapp or google assistant is very limited in its possibilities and often erroneous
__label__3 there is an annoying bug in the calender widget the day is not refreshed it shows always the day the widget was created and i have to manually select the current day to see the tasks please fix it and i give 5 stars
__label__4 very nice app it could use some more work but i like the color tags and the plan your day feature
__label__5 very useful i think i'll be using this for a lifetime for further improvements or updates i wish there could be more premium functions for free more event color options more readable layouts etc but i hope no update could ruin this already very functional app like what happens to other good apps
__label__3 no of activities that we can add is only 5 that's why i give this 3
__label__3 pls my dudes minimize number of clicks to set edit delete task's reminder time i feel like all i do is tap tap tap tap
__label__3 i have been using this app everyday but last update cleared all my future reminders now its impossible to recollect those important reminders searching for better alternative reply awesome tried your advise to sign out and sign in but lost yesterdays reminders also fyi i had requested forgot password for this account
__label__3 no email notifications for scheduled tasks not good
__label__5 been using this app for a year now and have created something like 20 lists that contain sublists reminders to do's groceries pretty much anything and everything and i've been so pleased with the whole experience in my opinion this is the best task app for android and the developer tries to sort out issues and responds quickly to feedback i highly recommend this app
__label__5 tracking my progression on goals has never been easier this app is so simple yet it's amazing and i love that you can share your progression with friends for accountability the only thing i don't understand is the various greetings notifications they send you in different languages
__label__1 full screen video ads i can live with banner ads but not this
__label__2 after 6 years of using wunderlist the day has come to look for a new to do app microsoft to do is missing the most important feature of wl i e placing newly addly added and favourite items to the top of the to do list practically the app is useless if you have long lists with floating items i have sent them this feedback 6 months ago and they still did not change anything about this
__label__2 so it's good i payed for pro but the issue i'm having is adding my routine to my timeline because whenever i try and add it it takes me to edit my routine it's really annoying because i'd like my routine in one clean place if this is fixed i'd definitely rate it 4 stars
__label__4 this app is awesome trust me it will keep you on track
__label__2 the update got rid of a major tool for me you can no longer press and hold the task to bring up the option to delete it not even sure how you delete on mobile now which is very inconvenient
__label__4 i definitely like this app however i can't rate it 5 5 because it erased all of my routines this morning so it's been a bit of a tedious process trying to reprogram everything back in
__label__1 purchased but a disappointment after phone boot the widget is all black until it completely loads and is annoying ideally the developer should cache calendar entires to prevent such issues and refresh once the app is fully up and functional the issue is prominent with nova launcher on oreo 8 1 on tugapower rom for the oneplus one
__label__4 i love the app so much it has improved my productivity but recently it has stopped opening i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but still it isn't working please try to resolve the issue at the earliest
__label__3 a really good app but since the new update the interface look so bad was so much cuter and clean before now it's weird
__label__4 mostly a good app helps me keep on top of things morning notifications are a bloody lifesaver my only criticisms are that the free version is rather lacking in basic features at least for people like me coming from other apps also the top bar and the system status bar when in the app are different colors slightly and that's always bugged me
__label__3 nice visualization of personal activities
__label__5 i love this app so much they make it really fun for free players too so you don't feel left out if you don't spend money i have decided to get a subscription though since it's such a great app it has my whole family super motivated my kids are actually loving doing chores and i also love all the social aspects to it as well it would be cool of you could assign names for your pets and the app doesn't function quite the same as the website version but overall i have no complaints
__label__3 widget does not update itself shows up empty and had to replace everytime refresh doesn't work on latest app and os
__label__3 the reminders aren't partixularly noticeable
__label__5 i sent email to the developer there's only one and they solved everything within minutes great app helps with tasks and even small silly works it is improving quickly and is getting better every time
__label__5 i love this app it helps me to stay organized it's very convenient i used to write my to do list on paper but it's so much easy to have this app right at my finger tips its allows me to break my list down into categories and use different colors to differentiate each category
__label__3 it replaced wunderlist but actually the functionality was down graded sharing is done with a link instead of directly with a contact
__label__3 pls allow us the option to disable the text formatting in the event description i mean disable the formatting toolbar from showing up at the bottom of the description box when creating editing events thanks
__label__4 great app
__label__4 i love this app it's easy to customise can you add a feature for a timer that way people can measure how long they did a certain task for
__label__5 best app only few changes please in the edit option can't seem to change first date and repeat interval please add full editing same as when making a habit or task thank you
__label__5 its actually improved how i do things and caused me to be more active i love this app
__label__1 needs registration can't use existing caldav task accounts
__label__3 i wish to have flexible goal like do xx minutes exercise per week month
__label__3 great app intuitive navigation easy to use nice integration with other apps what's up with the lavender color designation i didn't think that lavender would look turquoise
__label__4 nice apps but need to re download the full version
__label__3 app is good but it could have better
__label__3 this used to be great app for tasks but with recent update i can no longer move each task around in widget according to importance or my day frustrating as i luv organizing each days tasks in order not in wiget anymore
__label__2 you can't set a location by name only address yes i tried setting my location manually like that would be at all useful do you even understand what i'm saying i cant type in la fitness and get an address it will just send me to whichever is closest setting my location wouldn't help it would just send me to the closest one to my manual instead of one that may be further worthless
__label__4 i have reminder set for every weekday morning at a certain time hasn't reminded me at the right time yet always hours after i get it
__label__3 can you please enable different ringtone modes and if the app could notify us if we have missed a reminder it'll be great
__label__3 i thought i finally found my reminder but this app lacks 2 important aspects 1 no possibility to sort tasks in chronological order why 2 no persistent sound like any other rekinder app i ve met why plus no subtasks
__label__1 doesn't work at all like it should spent ages trying to set it up correctly but it just keeps letting me exit out of the app with no repercussions whatsoever pretty lame since i just wasted a lot of time following faq's with 0 results well earned this 1 star as long as this isn't fixed
__label__5 um app muito bom com várias atividades já prontas e com possibilidade de personalização de atividades a única coisa ruim é a notificação de você não estiver com o celular na mão ou muito perto de você você provavelmente não vai ver a notificação só coloco a vibração tirando isso é perfeito
__label__3 hey guys this is good idea however i have a feedback for you several times i accidentally was clicking task more than once so i was increasing my level i didn't found related settings i think you should make task clickable checkable do you get me only once per day and highlight the finished tasks this features will prevent accidental checking therefore increasing level incorrectly could you explain me how to use such features if you already have them
__label__3 good
__label__3 confusion regarding 'sharing' your schedule with other team members or subscibers seriously would it kill them to put an 'added' 'enter' or some kind of 'task completed' button it would save a lot of confusion sending an invite to fellow workers results in a vague link that seems disconnected with the original intention no 'connect with users' or anything other than a link for something that's supposed to be time management related i've wasted hours trying to figure this out
__label__4 i really love timetune in helping me better utilize my time see where it is all going and plan routine tasks so that i can stay on top of my busy life the only thing missing for me is the ability to tick things as completed and cross if not done i'd love to be able to analyze my routine to see what worked well and what i struggled to acheive i find it rewarding and motivating being able to check things off as done
__label__3 i used to love this app but since my phone updated it no longer works i recently uninstalled and re installed i hope it works or i'll have to find something new
__label__4 quite good
__label__3 don't like it very much but i think it's just not for me it's very complex and deep with tasks and such i could even set the percentage of fear for a task what so i didn't get very far before i just said forget it my life is too busy for such complexity
__label__3 i love the concept of habit bull but it isn't user friendly
__label__5 easy to use solid synchronization really good
__label__4 i like this app and i use it everyday for studying and reaching the amount of time i wanna stay focused on my works that need to be done everything is great but i really wish there were an option for us to choose the apps that we need during doing our works and tasks i've study apps and websites i need to use but i can't because of this limit therefore i won't plant trees i wish you could give us options about the apps we wanna use and the ones we don't it's rly a problem please fix this tnx
__label__4 good
__label__5 it is a great app and it helps me keep my schoolwork on time
__label__2 get multiple entries of same appointment problem is with outlook and exchange 360 occurs with other calendars too
__label__1 i wish clicking the widget week view just simply opened the app itself instead of the day view agenda and it keeps lagging and freezing intermittently almost can't use the app anymore due to this huawei p30 pro i have disabled battery management but app still freezes for 5 seconds every time i delete an event and for many other actions as well
__label__2 widget is buggy a task marked as completed in the app is displayed as overdue and trying to tick it off in the widget takes me into edit mode the proper app when reopened shows a blank inbox and revisiting the screen is required to populate it again poor punctuation eg 28 sep 2017 why the space before the comma is not that big a deal but also adds to the app not feeling very pro
__label__1 bogus app update isnt working i was using the same app in past in the same device it was working properly now i hv updated and its not giving any notification and even status bar is showing the past activities not current
__label__1 the app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list rpg but there's a subscription you have to pay for literally completely ruins the purpose of the app
__label__3 just started using the app app is user friendly but i put my phone in vibration mode and notification alarms never worked all the times i set passed without any notification i am surprised because i had taken habitnow off the battery optimisation list on my phone and i expected alarms to work without any hitches
__label__4 honestly l o v e this app already and i've only had it for like 30 minutes but there seems to be a small bug after the timer finishes i don't know if it's intentional but the pop up that gives you coins just keeps popping up i get 10 coins i press okay then another pop up comes giving me another 10 coins it doesn't end until i have to remove the app from my history despite that this is an amazing app for studying
__label__4 the best to do app i've used by far one tiny feature design request can you please show the subtask count total and completed in the widget as well currently i need to click the task in the widget which leads me to the task screen on app which shows the subtask count
__label__2 such a waste of such a great app would have given it five stars if it didn't constantly crash causing it to either not open once time's up unless i force close losing my tree or not notifying me in the first place as it crashed halfway through and again losing my tree i hope this can be fixed in the near future because i'm not willing on giving up on this app this soon
__label__3 love the app and bought the full version in february but recently it quit syncing between my phone and my tablet i emailed support about the issue on june 2 the tasks are syncing now but calendar items still are not syncing wish they would fix the issue
__label__3 i don't like the new update it's very confusing i can't use it anymore
__label__3 it was really great until i bought my samsung s9 was using an s6 prior and when i transferred the business calendar program to the s9 the calendar's search function no longer worked i ask you how useful is a business cakendar without a search function
__label__3 could do with a reward or goal feature when habit followed
__label__5 this is one of the apps which i would recommend everyone to do check this out
__label__1 i have bad experience
__label__1 definitely not worth downloading the app keeps crashing does not record the time focused properly and hinders with functioning of the other apps no point in buying the premium version either a total waste of money latest update is just not upto the mark customizing anything usually results in the app crashing
__label__3 the should be some kind of dashboard where as administrator monitor progress on particular tasks and also have tasks maned by two or more personal
__label__5 well done for those peple who made this one for me
__label__5 i like it what i would really like to be able to do with it is to set it on my homepage to where as soon as i open my phone my schedule is right there in place of my clock food for thought thanks edit wow thanks developer responded to my query within hours changed from 4 to 5
__label__3 i really like this app still having problems trying to figure out how can it work best for me
__label__2 you have to buy pro version
__label__3 the app is making me sign in to an account but won't let me sign in frustrated
__label__1 uninstalled in 5 minutes it didn't populate anything that i had on my calender i even tried to manually put in events and it wouldn't show on widget
__label__4 great premium allows for more alarms and reminders but i don't have premium so that sucks
__label__2 used to love this app but after the update it's dumb and no longer useful
__label__4 great premium allows for more alarms and reminders but i don't have premium so that sucks
__label__4 with the new update when you tap tasks or the eggs and hatching potions you have to close and reopen the app in order to get it to load but otherwise the update is really cool
__label__3 good app but im a premium user for more than one year and have been requesting features on the official support forum like change dates of lots of overdue dates at once on windows app and never even got a response
__label__4 good
__label__5 one week of use i purchased a subscription i've used other similar apps i enjoy this the most there a few improvements needed so i need to add suggestions to the reddit page i spent time wrote out what i value in life what my aspirations are then i narrowed down a few simple goals to reach those aspirations then i added my goals to this app so far it's easy to keep track of my goals habits how i'm doing it's incredibly easy even fun to use thank you for this app
__label__5 great
__label__5 the best time managing app easy to use
__label__5 it's fun and easy to use
__label__2 you should have name to change date with yesterday today tomorrow not number on widget view
__label__2 puts basic functionality such as setting notfications behind a paywall you have to pay monthly or yearly
__label__3 this application was exactly what i needed when i first started to use it now there are a handful or problems events are appearing twice events get deleted or not appearing at all after being saved deleting one event and the reoccurring events get deleted and not appearing on the selected reoccurring days very annoying
__label__1 not as advertised
__label__5 great
__label__4 i loved this app because it has a calendar and to do list in one go i can categorize my tasks and put subtasks below but when i recently updated the app no radio button to tick off for the subtasks i handle a lot of tasks categorized plus the notes below the subtasks is not there anymore you need to add more clicks it was easy and organized now in uninstalling so sad i thought i have found the app was about to go premium to get the full benefits but uninstalling
__label__4 awesome app very helpful and does its purpose very well just wish it was free or a one time purchase
__label__1 suddenly not displaying all other calendars and after reinstalling app won't open
__label__3 yes at first attempt it look user friendly i am pleased good app
__label__4 good app overall but still doesn't recognise the date of reminder from plain text this needs to improve
__label__3 i use it mainly for its widgets one thing though please fix the widgets so that the they show the current date and don't stay put on the previous day unless manually changed
__label__2 i loved this until recently many entries disappear panic attack i can't count on it anymore what gives
__label__5 very usefull app for divideing tasks
__label__4 amazing app i just wish that non premium members could have an account so we could save our forests that we've already planted over the years the trees we bought and the coins we have had
__label__3 i update to latest version and notification sound won't stop i saw in log its already fixed so i try to reinstall couple of times but still the same i'm not always around or have the phone on my hand all the time to make it stop considering to download older version instead
__label__4 great app but is subscription based app
__label__2 i used to love this app because of its theme but the new skins totally kill the app
__label__1 it took 3 tries to get registered now it wont let me change anything in character creation i didnt even make it to setting up anything beyond skin tone before it wouldn't let me select anything awesome idea crappy execution womp womp
__label__4 i have to uninstall it because i need more habits to track but the free version cant provide more than 5 habits
__label__3 i would give it a 5 but i recently got a new phone and i cannot sync at all i really needed it to sync very disappointed because i followed all the steps in my email please help
__label__5 very good
__label__3 no updates long time ago
__label__1 how to use this help me please
__label__4 the app itself is great and i don't mind that there's a paid premium version in fact i think that's a great idea but i don't want to have to pay a subscription for a simple list app i'd absolutely pay a generous one time price for it because the app is worth it but i don't care for another subscription i'll have to stick with the free version
__label__4 perfect
__label__5 i refer to this app constantly it feels super rewarding to do things and keeps me motivated to do the tedious stuff i used to procrastinate on i love it
__label__2 this has helped me so much i love the app but i swear my coins disappear anyone else having this issue
__label__4 awesome app wish had auto sort feature of priority task like franklin planner use to have
__label__1 used to be 5 stars i've used this app for years the sudden addition of full page unskipable adds ruined it it looks like i'm not alone in my disappointment
__label__3 hey i downloaded the app and paid for the premium because i saw a memo in a box it said if i unlocked premium i'd get 7000 coins which i have yet to see in my app balance i only have 116 coins and it is asking me to pay more to receive any coins what gives
__label__4 very useful reminders at specific times which stay on the screen really help me get stuff done would like to be able to create own catagories and choose colours and icons for these in the premium version thank you
__label__3 highly user friendly but the free version lacks some of the useful features
__label__3 great ui the idea is great but need a way to mark tasks routine item as complete and so we can't even know our progress guess the use case itself is completely different
__label__2 use to love this app as i've had it for well over a year just recently it magically deleted all my appointments with no way of getting them back tried everything from resetting to reinstalling no resolution i paid for the app so was a little disappointed that i have to look for another app and reenter all my appointments 20 a day
__label__4 love it best i could find so far
__label__3 good for me
__label__3 ui needs major improvements the only app i believe which give quantitative habits also not just binary like 4 pages to read statistics based on that can be improved but nevertheless kudos for the idea this is only app which gives upto 7 habits in free version so keeping it else due to ui would have rejected long time back current apps in market give 3 or 5 max
__label__2 app is having some problem after certain time it stops accepting timers
__label__2 awesome app but soo many bugs
__label__5 great but i'm on premium and i cant cancel play store not showing subscription either
__label__2 the idea is wonderful but a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression for example information is slowly updated even within the application often clicking on a menu item is ignored if you create a task without a title but with a list it will become closed for editing just delete not all things are obvious i had to read help to solve simple questions well the old school 8 bit graphics not everyone likes it
__label__2 this app is either really good or really bad broken there are no in betweens i love the concept and its super cute but it bugs out quite a bit and besides which is super easy to misclick on as a result i've lost or accidentally lost items as well as accidentally spending nearly all of my coins completely on accident because there's no verification for buying and no refunding and that's besides the part where it constantly unequips all of my gear this game needs help
__label__1 wanted to try this but it doesn't seem to properly load images to create my character or load tutorial pages so i can't even continue from the create screen seems like it's broken
__label__2 moved from wunderlist and am disappointed by the lack of functionally for example there is no option to show weekly tasks and to display tasks in the widget they need to be moved manually
__label__4 i bought the pro version and like it so far for now what i'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself with the left and right arrows and not only from inside the app why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself other than that the app seems to be very practical if the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented it would be a 5 star app for me thanks
__label__3 this app would be perfect if it had a translucent widget but naw it's gotta take up every pixel it can even when i got nothing to do i do recommend it over others though
__label__1 doesn't show character customisation think it needs an update
__label__3 good
__label__5 great
__label__4 me gusta es para quitar el vicio
"__label__2 while it certainly wasn't expensive it was a waste of money in the fact 
that i found this app to do very little more than any calendar after 
reading the faq it says it's more than a calendar how especially since 
adding anything is done in the same way you create a calendar event the 
 routine function is a missed opportunity in that i think it will help me 
establish a morning routine for myself but in reality it's about creating 
calendar events that repeat a slightly expanded component of any free 
calendar our there when i think of tuning my time spent i'm thinking 
better organization for smaller tasks then find myself spending an hour 
setting 1 minute events for myself that i was never actually notified about 
lol what irony unfortunately it was not time or money well spent"
__label__3 i accepted a 14 day free trial but changed my mind just straight away how do i cancel i go into my subscriptions in google play but i do not find this app among my subscriotions i suppose it will turn up there only when the 14days free trial is over pleas confirm how to cancel thanks
__label__4 love it however when it says homescreen i thought it would show up on the homescreen of my phone but i order for me to see it i have to open the app so not as helpful as i thought it would be is there a way to make it part of my homescreen where is is always present
__label__4 it's helping me the way i think
__label__2 not that good after using
__label__5 very nice app for phone addicted
__label__1 awful at one point i bought the business calendar 2 app and i the update has ads i'm supposed to purchase the newest version yeah no thanks
__label__4 make more advanced settings for paid subscription not the color of the theme
__label__3 the app doesn't prevent me from using the unnecessary apps the app did but idk suddenly it doesn't anymore even the help doesn't help bc it only shows for vivo oppo huawei and xiaomi where's samsung i hope you repair this asap thx
__label__1 love this calendar up until a few days ago the ads used to be fairly non intrusive which i get and could totally live with now they have a full screen animation that you have to wait on to use the calendar totally unacceptable when i'm with a customer absolutely do not recommended this calendar as currently configured
__label__4 this is so helpful i use this with the forest app to stay on task you can add different calenders from google and keep work and personal separate
__label__1 it's not working properly always fails to remind no more reminder notification this feature suppose to work for free version if the promise features in free version doesn't work how can i get confident to buy paid version request team to fix this issue
__label__4 good but too many ads
__label__3 i wanted to give the app more stars as i love the concept but it's so buggy especially with the dailies feature all the dailies are linked together somehow there are some things i do mon sat for instance but not on sundays but when i set a task to not repeat on sunday it sets all tasks that way very frustrating
__label__4 it's a great app almost providing everything you want for free not like other apps i just wish if there was a timer beside each task you do such that you can spend tasks more efficiently and switch between them anyway great job guys
__label__3 there could be any difference between gold that we earn if my rewards are cheat meal and netflix episode and tasks are run 10 km and read a book it shouldn't be able to get a cheat meal reward for reading a book
__label__5 really user friendly effective in keeping track of your habits and achieving your goals 100 recommend
__label__5 very much featured app this app is all i need to manage my time
__label__1 not free you will be billed without you knowing about the loss of your money
__label__4 ever since i downloaded this app i've gotten less lazy i've done more work and i was able to keep track of my tasks needed i would rate 5 5 stars but i would like this app to have compatibility on windows or have some sort of chrome extension if i am mistaken and there is a windows chrome extension please notify me thank you
__label__4 the game is pretty fun but it's really frustrating to pay 100 coins for an enchanted armoire chest and only get experience or food it's honestly beginning to ruin the game for me if it doesn't change in about a month i'm rewriting this review to leave a lower score
"__label__1 auto fail only works if you go to each task that's not auto fail makes no 
sense might as well go back to life rpg that feature was the only reason 
i even tried this subscription model ridiculous why would i pay a monthly 
fee for some icons they are helpful icons necessary mostly but that's 
just ridiculously expensive for some icons a one time fee is reasonable 
even if it was like 5 i wanted to like this app but this got in the way"
__label__2 looks good until you have to pay 3 month to add labels
__label__5 i can't say enough good things about the app and the dev and support teams super stable lots of great features and the most responsive support team i've worked with personally or professionally invest in this app you'll love it and you'll support a company that is doing app development right
__label__3 not so helpful but the app is good
__label__3 rather new to the app to rate it higher than a 3 at this time but i like the results it is helping me to achieve i expect improved time management as i get the app's feature set up to serve me best i sense i may rate it higher as i experience it benefits more i do like using it better then wunderlist
__label__5 i really like so far i makes my daily routine a bit fun and make it meant something in a way
__label__4 i've had this for about 6 months now and tbh its helped me out you're allowed 5 free habits any more than that you have to pay but i think 5 is a great start because you dont want to bombard yourself with too many changes its simple easy to use it takes awhile to form habits so be patient and honest with your entries it'll help you see where you're failing and succeeding by i noticed i did habits because i didnt want to fail now i notice i perform habits because i want to excel
__label__2 im still getting accustomed i like the simplicity
__label__3 just upgraded to premium version app and google play list subscription at 27 99 i got charged 29 84
__label__1 not updated anymore unstable
__label__1 waste of time failed to pair with mu gmail account gave up after 5 attempts
__label__2 i don't get this app
__label__1 a negative experience i wasn't using it and forgot about it until it was renewing i didn't port it over to a new phone and it seems you can't cancel the app except through the app this means i would have to install it on my new phone give it permission to access my information then cancel the subscription and uninstall it other apps on my phone with subscriptions i can cancel through google play apparently not this one
__label__1 nice good
__label__3 drag and drop task is not working tasks disappear while dropping
__label__5 its so good that you could write down your to do list in check boxes then cross it out
__label__3 middle experience
__label__3 i've used this app before and i like it the only issue is there are no breaks it's kind of difficult to study and have no breaks
__label__5 i lovet it
__label__3 repeating tasks seriously need to be automatically added to 'my day' view on their due date each time it would also be useful if there's an additional option to automatically delete completed tasks instead of just hiding them
__label__3 it was easy to use the first few days but now it's only adding everyday things like feeding my dogs to my list every other day and not letting me fix it it also doesn't send notifications so in order to remember my todo list i have to remember to open an app with my todo list
__label__4 it is a great app but still there is space for some improvement the calendar for example you have one to add more tasks other to see each specific task and the days that you did the job but note one to see the sum of all tasks you should create a resume calendar where i can see the percentage of jobs that i accomplished in each day
__label__2 events won't show up on the clock after i adjust the time of the event they show up and then i change the time and they disappear so so frustrating i wanted to save time not waste it why why why i used this app for 5 minutes and then hit a roadblock why
__label__4 i dont get notifications regarding my daily goals
__label__3 update to my original review to clarify i'm saying that in previous versions you could choose which list to put the task under when doing a quick add of it via the widget on home screen and same for adding it from the bottom quick bar in the app in the current version it doesn't allow you to choose the list when doing a quick add your reply to my review is describing the regular long way of adding the task i want to be able to choose the list when quick adding from the widget
__label__2 i went on thinking it was easy to put in reminders and stuff but it isn't you have to buy the full version
__label__3 hi i liked the concept very much unfortunately the design really bothered me the different trees are not in the same drawing style and they don't fit together just hated seeing them next to each other
__label__1 has so many bugs it's keep crashing
__label__3 i have purchased pro version but still no calendar view please add calendar view beside the timeline view
__label__2 started off really well but has stopped working properly now great shame as it has a lot of promise
__label__5 easy to use and the colors help organize my tasks
__label__4 add alarms to notification in events or tasks and allow to add ringtone on it love it
__label__1 clicking on the widget doesn't open the app anymore
__label__2 adds new tasks to bottom not top this app adds new tasks to the bottom of the to do list not to the top this is different than every other to do list i have used including wunderlist on which this app is to be based please fix this ridiculous problem at least give me a setting to add new items to the top or the bottom of the list
__label__1 cannot link with other google products such as keep notes the tags function forces user to upgrade
__label__3 i'm giving this app 3 out 5 because there is a really annoying behaviour when you're adding a quick note and if you by mistake tap outside the text box which one would do on the go your note is erased and you need to start again i'm considering uninstalling it because this happens almost every time i add a note which means that it takes me twice the time please at least keep the text and don't erase it in case of an accidental tap outside the box thanks
__label__5 good habit tracker
__label__3 i love everything about this app except for how it handles snoozing repeat tasks it's easy to use and has a lot of configuration something a lot of other apps save for the premium version unfortunately i find it unusable due to how snoozing repeat tasks then alters the date time for all future occurrences making it difficult to manage these tasks when i just want to snooze it this one time if this was changed i would give 5 stars and upgrade to premium as the app is otherwise perfect
__label__2 i'm just not finding time to work with this app so by no means the star rank im giving the apl is just a temp ranking
__label__4 i really like this app especially the natural noises it makes me feel so calm but for some reason even though i made the app on in the settings it still asks me to do so it's nothing really really recommend it
__label__5 a fun and beautiful way to organize your life i'm a huge fan
__label__2 annoying backup system i've had installed this app and logged in with google account once i also tried some of the app's features but i uninstalled again because of reasons after some times i decided to install it again so i made my tasks and the others without logging in first because i forgot then when i logged in with my google account after that it replace my current data with the older one without warning now all my newly created more complete data is all gone
__label__2 it is not very flexible it's a pain to make sub lists and quickly edit them i wish when the app opened you see a list of all of your major tasks or a calendar if these things are possible maybe adding a tutorial feature when the app first downloads and opens would help streamline the experience
__label__5 this app is simple and effective i totally love the reminders to complete my tasks and goals being able to look back at the calendar and see where i suceeded is awesome
__label__5 very easy to use i love it
__label__4 widget improvement needed if i'm in the 'groceries' tab when i add a task in the widget it should add the task in the current tab 'groceries' now it add tasks on the 'tasks' tab by default when it should add tasks to the current tab by default the app is good but needs improvements
__label__3 i like the idea of this app i already purchase the pro version but some blacklisted app still unable to wither the tree when i open it from notification such as line and whatsapp also when i opened game there is no floating banner that warn me to go back to the forest app
__label__3 good for notes needs export email options
__label__2 only a few habits for free not worth paying for
__label__1 the idea behind the app is good although after paying for premium the promised cloud sync does not work several users mention the same issue there is no way of backup the data either i cannot see any feedback from devs here switched to a different app habits
__label__3 interesting
__label__2 'it's free forever' but 'reminders are a premium feature ' hmm i'm dyspraxic without much money to waste and i'm looking for a to do list app to help with this without reminders this app is functionally useless to me disappointed that you've opted to content carve to this extent and i'd argue your claim of being free is misleading please reconsider which features to gatekeep because locking basic functions behind a paywall makes me less likely to support you financially
__label__4 didn't like it at first too complicated compared to your previous super minimal reminder applet attached to launcher i like it now especially since i know how most bits work
__label__2 please fix the widget it doesn't automatically update the day it always shows yesterdays' date constantly having to remove and install widget
__label__1 i don't get a notification or any alarm after i set the due date reminder at all i've already tried a couple of times how do i fix this my settings also allow notifications for the app also how do i set widget on home screen thanks
__label__5 hope there'll be a tab for events
__label__1 after purchase sync is not working then y sholud i purchase this app profile name is empty while editing it says something went wrong and so on
__label__2 yeah this is not user friendly there should be some kind of tutorial this is not the kind of app you can just jump in and start using which is what i was hoping for
__label__4 health widget stopped working after latest android update note 8 at t interesting take on habit forming i'm not really a gamer but i like the point system leveling up and buying accessories for your avatar with those points nerdy fun that seems to actually be motivating me in a way other habit trackers haven't been able to the ted talk on the inspiration for this app is really interesting too
__label__4 i couldn't change the language of this software i tried it again and again but the language didn't change
__label__3 i love this app it's the only one that looks and feels like the old franklin planner however since the latest update i have a banner ad on the bottom of the screen with google ads and i am a paid pro user this is extremely annoying if they don't remove this i'm leaving
__label__4 a great app but i miss a overview of week activity's the app get confusing to use after adding some tasks
__label__2 great app but since the last update time runs out and nothing happens
__label__2 so you tell me to pay every month for same functionality in premium no still doing normal in everything else
__label__5 love it
__label__4 its the best app when it comes to tracking your progress but one problem thats why i didnt give it a 5 star when you set reminders it doesn't work maybe on my phone but it doesn't send you reminders besides that its really a good app to kick start 2020
__label__4 good
__label__3 i like it so far
__label__5 these developers have done an amazing job with this app no annoying popups no ads no bugs overall a flawless experience for me it's been four years since i've used it so i'm excited to get back into it
__label__2 it is completely failing on reminders
__label__3 this is a decent time managment app the ability to create routines is handy though it doesnt warn you or show if activities are overlapping the most recent update as of 3 30 2020 made the app look much cleaner which is nice i would like to see more personalization options t'wards the look af the tags and app choices now are very slim the 5 price tag for the pro version doesn't feel worth it yes buyer's remorse so if you can manage fine with the free version stick with that
__label__3 the app is good but it would be better if it had a timeline please do something about that
__label__1 the app was last updated on 2018 looks like the devs abandoned it i've been having trouble with reminders a key feature of the app but haven't heard back from the devs
__label__3 just started using the app app is user friendly but i put my phone in vibration mode and notification alarms never worked all the times i set passed without any notification i am surprised because i had taken habitnow off the battery optimisation list on my phone and i expected alarms to work without any hitches
__label__3 please can you integrate with outlook calendar
__label__1 app keeps crashing
__label__5 very simple good for keeping you away from your phone also planting trees is the best for the environment because plants keep animals alive and animals keep plants going by herbivores eating plants then pooping out seeds and predators keep herbivores in check so they don't eat to many plants it's a symbiotic relationship keep this up
__label__4 great
__label__1 what should i do if i want more sublists there is no way
__label__2 very complex ui it needs google calendar and doesn't work without it i needed a app like this but as a daily planner not just showing the calendar events from google calendar stupidly on a clock
__label__3 lacking in features compared to competition like ticktick todoist etc
__label__1 needs registration can't use existing caldav task accounts
__label__3 vibrates even in silent mode without vibrations even on 485
__label__4 was my goto calendar for years easy intuitive configurable it's issue for me is using the android calendar sync vice directly syncing with google i need to have access to historical and distant future events if the developers can change the sync option i'd come back in a heartbeat and rate it a 5 just noticed reply yes i did try this work around and others from my research did not work unfortunately still unusable for me sorry
"__label__3 it's good but since we always have more than 1 thing to do we write three 
or more things to do and when we go to priorities ex c1 a4 b2 etc we 
wouldn't know which to do so we suggest you have more of those thanks"
__label__3 well it was good until it just kept crashing and i don't know why
__label__3 this was useful so i decided to unlock the pro version but after paying i couldn't unlock it and it kept saying that there's a problem i tried all th solutions listed but it still did not resolve it i would like a refund please
__label__5 this is quite frankly the best to do app i've ever used it has features i didn't even know i needed like searching for tasks or the my day tasks list it syncs really well and worked even better than i'd hoped great job
__label__5 really really good at what it does great customization with a really lightweight interface i can't wait to see where it goes
__label__2 would have been nice to explore more features without having to go pro right out of the gate i'm not down to pay for something that supposedly works without trying it for myself could have easily enabled more options that entices the user other than the bare bones vs i'll stick with google for the time being
__label__1 will not open disappointed as i was looking forward to using this service
__label__3 i used to use this app to set intervals of when i would check in to games i was playing but since they removed the timer feature for some reason the scheduling stuff doesn't suit my purposes still the app should be able to help you maintain a schedule just fine but most phones have that feature built in
__label__3 too tricky complicated not immediate maybe isnt what i need i need something more simple
__label__5 easy to use set up a lot of goals easy to track
__label__3 well i like the app and it truly helps me stay focused combined with some time restriction methods it's good although those ones are short times plus breaks achievements are boring and not good enough they try to make you pay for extra but the app itself is not exciting enough to pay the achievements are not really worth it and it's hard to unlock new trees even with pro version no new campaigns are launched collecting coins is not an easily achievable task too hard to get new trees
__label__4 wow they listened they added links between task which was my idea good if only they could be consistent across platforms improve rating to 4 stars just cuz the ticktick team is really trying to be better aldous allow us to see the changes you make in the app
__label__5 i love the fact this integrates with whatsapp i use it for work and personal it make thing so much easier
__label__1 there seems to be no way to actually mark a task as complete so i had to delete the tasks i actually did complete and therefore have not gotten in game rewards there is also no way at all to contact support if you join the habitat help guild that is supposed to allow you to ask questions there is no obvious way to post a question there there is a button to leave the guild but not one to post a question this app is terrible and is a waste of time
__label__3 app is great but the events are not getting created only one two events for a day is created than even it shows created its not
__label__4 love it
__label__3 removed two stars because of the horrible checkboxes changing things like that without a option to disable is a disrespect to paying customers previous 5 star review recommended for anyone who wants the most feature filled to do list tested a lot of them and this really stands out you can adapt it to a lot of workflows and the new integrations made it even better
__label__1 lies no multi device syncing on premium
__label__1 it's been 1 week since i'm using the app the reminder system worked fine for 1day and from next day the reminder system stopped functioning really disappointed may be uninstalling the app after few days hope this helps
__label__2 paid for the pro version and itbdoesn't seem to be working properly appointments are not showing and sometimes double books contacted support took several days to get back to me and was still not helpful app is glitchy will not be renewing the subscription and going back to the old pencil and paper appointment tracking method i cannot run my business with a faulty appointment app very disappointing
__label__2 lost the ability to sort to dos by tags very inconvenient i used that feature a lot
__label__3 i really like the visual round of this app however i would love to be able to personalise it more easily
__label__4 my go to tasks app happy to finally see a premium payment because you deserve money for this thing but immediately saddened that it's subscription only i get why but please add a one time payment option too for those of us who don't want to deal with such things
__label__3 good function weird execution the program works great but it has weird way of reminding the user of the habit like saying hey tiger its just weird
__label__3 nice but it's really irritating that you can't edit frequency or a start date but i could live with that unfortunately when your schedule circumstances change you have to create a new habit because you can't change days and frequency edit thanks guys for the prompt response fingers crossed the update with this feature is released soon
__label__5 still need to investegate all the features but already impressed will go pro soon
__label__3 seems laggy moving between lists and tabs after the latest update no way to delete a parent list without manually deleting all sublists first edit i see the delete option for subtasks but how do you delete sublists and parent lists i understand it's a hobby project and i appreciate that just making sure i'm not missing something
__label__2 i like how the app has options to write notes journals for each day it gives you the option to reflect on how you stuck to your habits most other apps don't have this feature that said i'm rating the app two stars because the notifications don't work for me i have set times for reminders throughout the day but the app sends me random notifications reminders when i don't want them and on other days no notifications at all no app updates from the developer in over a year either
__label__2 versão free não faz quase nada quase enganação falar que o app é gratuito
__label__4 awesome
__label__1 any app that ignores your phone's dark mode unless you pay for it is garbage
__label__1 well i just got it and attempted to create an account and after unfilled out the info it would not submit it what gives
__label__3 how do i set a daily weekly repeating task
__label__3 my routine is not repeating
__label__4 nice
__label__3 sound is not coming while the task is reminding how to get sound without sound while reminding is not useful please tell how to enable sound
__label__4 great app please add the ability to see when recurring habit is due or by automatically completing a habit which is not due i e required once a week for example
__label__1 will not work without connecting to an account
__label__5 once worked out how to use have found it very useful for listing daily items to do
__label__4 this app's perfect for helping manage one's time i'm amazing how much better i do when i can actually look at it and literally see my time flying by
__label__3 i love this ap but when the new update went through i no longer have the pro version please fix
__label__5 i'm on the quest of improving myself developing small good habits is pretty easy with this and using this app as a reminder for tasks is awesome
__label__2 used it awhile ago and recently installed on my new phone as soon as it opened it was clear i would not be able to use it several things where off like trying to put pictures in an office doc worse still when i try to add many options are cut off by some form of white box that sits in the way unfortunately dailies are one of the missing options and a huge part of how i personally used the app
__label__4 my primary app for all my calendar needs it works well the pro version makes my life easier ild however give it a 5 star if i could put photos up directly into the calendar instead of loading it up as a link
__label__3 firstly thanks for your quick responses back i appreciate it ok so can you explain how to do it and where that is on the app because there's no tutorial for that part when i click on the other tabs that show the month stats and graph there's nothing indicating that the old schedule has been saved in an independent track and a new track created
__label__5 i love how it says what the task is
__label__1 why i need sign in for just to do list doesn't make sense
__label__3 full of promise but the lack of word wrapping means task detail is hidden particularly bad for sub tasks where the font is also larger and therefore exacerbates the issue if and when this is resolved i'll be able to use the app and give a more balanced appraisal
__label__3 dont buy the premium the widgets don't work the reason i bought premium and i set up notifications for each hour to remind me of a task but the notifications only pop up if you open the app which render the notifications useless otherwise i enjoy the basic use of the app
__label__5 this is one cool app not only is it useful but it also has an aesthetically pleading footprint
__label__2 the app is awesome but it made my phone drain 30 battery per day in the background which makes it useless
__label__2 outlook のメールにフラグを立ててもtodo のflagged email に表示されない
__label__2 multiclick spam to encourage upgrading to pro version
__label__3 google play
__label__5 excellent
__label__3 decent app but would be so much better if you could set the worth of your tasks some tasks are simple like 'drink more water' others like 'save 2000' theres nothing but a crude difficulty rating to differentiate tasks we cam create rewards and their worth why wouldnt we have control of the amount of points for the tasks
__label__1 doesn't have a built in backup and even after exporting a backup file an error shows up additionally the support email is an invalid email address a total waist of time for setting it
__label__4 thanks for the response the fact that an event repeats should have nothing to do with the type of notification and i think there should still be a repeating icon if no notification is set it is possible to want an event to repeat without getting an alert also why is the default notification when there is a date all tasks with dates do not require a notification
__label__2 well it is good and motivational but i don't get notifications for the reminder moreover you have to pay for the widget
__label__3 new version of time tune is difficult to use please upgrade it
__label__3 too invasive and complicated
__label__5 user friendly simple but it has all the function i need
"__label__2 repeat function does not work making the app useless as a task list might 
as well use my calendar almost missed a credit card payment because this 
app didn't repeat the task"
__label__5 i'm a teacher and there are so many little things to do that pop up unexpectedly in my work ticktick has helped ease the mental load of remembering them all and it's more useful than a paper list as your phone is always handy i think i even sleep better because i have less stress about keeping up with tasks it's easy to reschedule tasks that you don't get to on a given day i also enjoy the habit forming function
__label__3 uncomfortable manual typing for time setting in a reminder time reminders are not stable some times push notifications doesn't work
__label__4 amazing functionality however i wish there was a guide for some of the more advanced features
__label__3 just getting used to it but so far not bad
__label__3 great overall somewhat limited
__label__3 its ok i haven't been able to figure out how to get reminds
__label__1 cannot get it to work on my huawei p20 i have tried 3 times and cannot get it to sign in it looks like it works fine on my ipad because i can sign up and get in but on my phone i am unable to do either i needed something that i could use on both devices but am unable to get into in ob my phone
__label__3 a good app overall but the new version no longer shows the duration of events which is extremely annoying and a deal breaker for me
__label__3 very cool and helps a lot
__label__5 wow
__label__2 how does it work
__label__3 its ok bought it sadly need another payment to customise palette sad hope more update come
"__label__3 buggy stuck with a connection to server error which seems ridiculous 
because all the app truly has to do is figure out what day it is and let 
you mark tasks off as complete nice concept as it does make doing daily 
chores and setting goals a bit more fun to complete but there's still a 
long way to go"
__label__1 it doesn't remind me i even forgot i still had it on my phone
__label__4 pretty useful
__label__3 it's good but coming from wunderljst the spacing in this app between task is too big when having many task the list get unnecessary long and cluttered please adjust or make it adjustable will rate 5 stars if adjusted
__label__3 can only have 5 unless you pay for premium
__label__5 this app is really unique it has made me interested again in being productive it's almost like adopting a lifestyle however the app is currently having a problem with task reminders it doesn't work most of the time and when it does the alert is usually delayed by approx 10 minutes also it would be nice if the developers provided the ability to make task lists even when offline other than that the app is perfect definitely recommend experiencing it
__label__5 i have found it's useful for you who want to manage your works or studies now i don't need to write all down on the papers so a solution to save papers save our trees more important this app is free and no ads banners that's good
__label__3 i like how minimalistic the app is it's very easy to use and has just the necessary features my biggest complaint is that i can't set a custom due date whenever i tap the due date i get predefined reminder and i can't seem to change it no matter what i'm using an lg q7 plus don't know if it's a bug with the device or what will update the score if this issue ever gets fixed
__label__2 reminder is not working in realme phone i did all the settings in my phone and app settings but still not working
__label__3 calendar has a lot of good features but half the time my reminders don't go off so i miss them paid for the full version but it still didn't help all of my friday reminders finally chimed on sunday kinda pointless
__label__4 very good excellent features especially for the subtask the option to add step for achieving the task subtask kindly add a calendar feature to get an overview of what is ahead also some ready made quick reminders like a call payment email a template for grocery etc would add cheery to the cake
__label__3 the app is good but the reminders for some of the habits are not working i have bought the pro version
__label__4 it was amazing i just didn't have the time to set it up all the way
__label__5 easy to use and works seamlessly it has helped me stay on track with my studies and even to take breaks timely breaks the incentives are fun and interesting enough to keep me wanting to plant trees i particularly enjoy labelling the trees as i can then export the data and see how many hours i have been working on different things it gives me the freedom to write up my own things in python to analyse that data and plan better for the next week
__label__2 day 2 of trialling this so far i've had two location reminders fail i can't label a location with more than one letter the only time based reminder that's fired did so while on a phone call so i don't know what it sounds like not that i can change the sound anyway because the instructions don't work i had no idea what the buttons meant so the first one tapped the task got snoozed for 28 hours how is that a typical snooze length adding anything more than a basic list item is not intuitive
__label__3 quite good but also need some improvement
__label__4 nice app use it almost everyday i wish you had the option to rollover the unfinished tasks for the next day
__label__1 i am on a sony xperia xz premium android 8 0 0 and the app when i move out of the app and use others does not wither the try thus spoiling the point yes all my notifications and permissions are on please help so i can actually have incentive growing the forest there is no crisis notification when i move out of it or onto other apps
__label__3 this app used to be brilliant it then began to function regardless of whether you were using your phone or not essentially just becoming a basic timer and then now the timer fails and kills trees when youre not using your phone i just planted a tree only for it to die 20 seconds after when my phone locked
__label__3 the app size is too heavy i would expect a lighter and storage friendly productive app of such as a better alternative if it is improvised
__label__1 still cannot share a single task with someone on ticktick you can only share a whole list this is ridiculous especially since the developers have promised it since 2013 i need this feature
__label__3 need google voice integration service to add task
__label__1 it's very easy to accidentally complete tasks and the only way to undo an accidental completion is behind a pay wall instant one star
__label__4 i have barely began using this app less than 15 minutes and i am already in love the terms you have to agree to alone are just so assuring and satisfying kudos developers kudos
__label__5 very good
__label__2 nice widget and i don't mind a few ads but persistent ads are annoying when i get annoyed i tend to rather go somewhere else than becoming a paying customer
__label__4 works well except it keeps asking to change the timezone when i switch to firefox
__label__1 it only lets you use it linked with google calendar you can't have 2 separate things
__label__3 just fine for me i mean it has a smooth transition and everything but all the cool stuff is paid it's like there's nothing extra for freebies you can do the same in a normal calendar
__label__3 good enough for a to do list app a few additional features would make it even better though option to re arrange list rename edit an existing item add a note or comment on an item sync interval to save battery life
__label__5 great app for encouraging you to do things love that you can personalise your own tasks and play with friends would love to see the ability to repeat tasks on weekdays weekends instead of just daily weekly and an undo button would be awesome sometimes i'll mark something by accident and can't revert what hearts i lost coins i earned etc
__label__1 i was really excited about this app but when i went to create an account it did not work i tried logging in with my google account but it still didn't work i am very disappointed
__label__3 great app
__label__3 no comments
__label__5 great habit tracking app very clean and simple interface fantastically elegant design other habit tracking apps are not as user friendly i contacted the developers on a couple of concerns i had and they were already working on these features to be added in future updates
__label__4 great app simple and neat ui it would however be nice if you could also include a passcode lock
__label__1 i understand the need to play ads in a free version but your ads are going for 30 seconds before you can get rid of them which makes this app unusable
__label__1 this is a pay to play calendar only
__label__2 not very easy to use you can figure it out after you play with it long enough but over all not very intuitive
__label__3 edit paid out good money last year to buy premium but you're still begging me to rate you well my original 5 stars becomes today's 3 stars leave me alone i rated 5 within minutes of buying old review i've purchased the premium version thank you the best in the play store edit i would appreciate it if next time you have a one day sale you make it abundantly clear in the actual app otherwise i'll never know thank you
__label__5 i have used wunderlist for about 5 years but now its being retired i tested and tried 10 apps since then and none were that great i stumbled upon ticktick and wish i had started using it years ago ticktick has much greater customization options and does a great job of incentivizing completion of tasks via feedback it has made my life much easier i do wish the widget had options to change how it appears the to dos do not have breaks between them
__label__4 after testing the app for a while i was ready to purchase it but read on your user guide that searching for tasks is not available on android do you know when it would be available also is there a one time fee purchase option is there a gmail integration feature like google tasks i like the minimalist simplistic clean look of your app nice work on the widgets thanks
__label__5 love this app it makes me focused on my work
__label__5 very useful and it syncs accross all of my devices this is now my must have app
__label__5 great design autocomplete the date if you add words such as do something wednesday and many other autocompletion features it's the best out there for sure and i've tried them all
__label__4 i just want to say that the tutorial was too much info things like this should be explained in a short and concise way at a good pace it was just too long and too much to take in i didn't even try the app though i can't say what rating it deserves i am unnistalling but i may come back to it in the future it's not you it's me also you can't delete your account on mobile but you can on desktop i suggest people to try the desktop version since it may have more features
__label__2 i just love this app sooo much it helps me a llot in focusing on my studies but many times it crasehes at the very last second i've lost millions of trees re installed and reported thousand times but unfortunately no improvement
__label__1 wunderlist was just fine why the same in a new jacket done worse just because it has to be microsoft microsoft stop trying to be what others do better edge why bing why buy a good working app and make it worse again why as a ux designer to ms business stop trying to outperform others who already are market leaders start finding new solutions for new user problems and be the market leader there if not a google will outperform you because they understand user problems better
__label__3 good interface and design but the sharing capabilities were riddled with issues the app became almost unusable if you tried to share anything
__label__3 it is ok bit too simple really and could do with a little bit of tlc and new features and just some developer input does the job though
__label__3 nice material design is to very old sound tons of todo managers with beautiful ux and interesting ux since 2015 not namy changes new releases is almost empty feels like this product develop single developer i whanta a customizible icons for every project rich graphics with analytics not single karma more actions or favorite projects in long press shortcuts manual sorting favorite projects more functions when i types a text more performance limit in 300 tasks per proje its nothing
__label__3 so far so good but two improvements would allow me to delete the other planner app i have on my phone 1 reminders i am looking for an app that would act like a print planner where i would list my tasks by day for the future i'd like to be able to check an app for mon tue weds etc but without having to set a specific reminder for each monday should just be monday without needing to set a time would be great to just have a list for the whole day 2 for lists such as grocery lists i don't see any setting to allow the app to stay on screen if you are currently in a store and trying to buy off your list this is important no one wants to grocery shop and have to constantly unlock their screen to see the list
__label__3 it was fine until i found that to use features like syncing or transferring lists from an older app i had to upgrade to and pay for premium felt like bait and switch
__label__3 will update down the road
__label__4 i love the app and ended up buying pro because i wanted to save my coins to plant a real tree why is there no option to watch an advert to double coins on pro version
__label__5 intuitive and easy to pick up
__label__4 very innovative concept it does what it claims to do reasonably well help you focus implementation could be better though few very essential features are behind paywall despite the app having ads
__label__4 fine app would be perfect to have desktop web version also to make adding routine much easier
__label__4 simple and practical
__label__1 harus memasang kembali widget setelah memulai ulang agar data muncul sesuatu yang mendasar namun tidak ada di aplikasi ini
__label__3 i think that this is a great idea but it s one better suited for a larger screen a lot of display real estate is utilized to beautifully display a very limited amount of information
__label__3 the app is ok but it could be much better in terms of usability for example 1 when setting a new reminder the first button which you are most likely to press without thinking should be 'set timer' not 'share the task' more people will want to set a reminder than share a person note 2 the 'focus' button when the reminder comes up is in the prime location for when you are typing using your phone and leads to you accidentally cancelling reminders each time
__label__1 impossible to cancel
__label__5 it's a really great app
__label__4 a great app for setting routines simple to use and very customizable a slight learning curve for the routine setting eg the symbols a few things that could be improved easily assigning routine for each day rather than programming a period of time from the pro version or the same routine from the free version also the widget could be more useful if it indicated the ending time as well the comment text style could also be better differentiated title tag of the event
__label__1 i hate apps that try to trick you into subscribing be transparent about the conditions of use for that alone i uninstalled this app straight away
__label__4 things were going great until i switched to a new phone i can't find out how to sync my tasks and events to the new phone i installed the app in my new phone and logged in but the data is not there i see that the events comes from the google calendar and i may be able to do something about that but how do i sync the tasks pls help
__label__1 subscription service to enable simple reminders is ridiculous i was willing to pay a one time fee for a solid app but having to pay nearly 5 per month just to enable reminders is absurd once i saw how many basic features were being kept behind a pay wall i had to stop using it
__label__3 i am having issues with the purchased premium version but am not getting any reply to my email inquiries generally i found the app great but this lack of support is really disappointing
__label__3 hey the app is great but can't deal with the constant glitches and crashes cheers
__label__5 so far i am in love this is exactly what i have been searching for to organize all of my todos the folder feature is the best and i think this will finally bring me into the world of digital calendars not to mention the feedback feature is super helpful to instantly get you on the right track with how things work
__label__3 i've only started using this this morning so far i'm hoping it helps with motivating me to accomplish things it's definitely a great idea i kind of am wishing the was done sort of story line to follow along with like ones you have so many days of completing so many habits you get a clue to find whatever your quest goal is or something like that would make it more exciting i'll update my review once i'm a week or 2 in
__label__5 i love this app it's a perfect replacement for my paper calendar i love that i can have my schedule meal plan tasks to do and more all at the tip of my fingers wherever i am i'm excited for all the plans they have to add even more awesome features
__label__4 the app is excellent simple streamlined functional to do list however the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control how do i select and reschedule a group of tasks how do i open the app from the widget so i don't need both the widget and an icon if i wanted to do complex editing i could easily open the app and the widget could do things the app couldn't give it back
__label__5 very helpful to have reminders and important details at your fingertips i wish there was a way to have it synch with an app or program on your computer
__label__2 dec 5 2019 update moved from 5 stars to 2 for the reason below i've had this app for about half a decade the last couple years have been irritating i add sub tasks when i go back to the tasks the sub tasks aren't there i wish there was a save button as a cue and confirmion that the subtasks are saved not sure how long i could forgive the app until i just use another one altogether please address subtasks staying in the next update thanks was 5 stars for the longest time awesome
__label__5 the recent updates were very amazing keep it coming devs this is close to perfection however i hope we can gain items attached to a particular task once the task is completed the items will be given directly to your inventory this can help us to create weekly task events or bosses it will be very rewarding thank you update one last thing in terms of habit generation can we have counting streak instead of count down the higher the streak the higher the rewards
__label__3 absolutely love the app but the new checkboxes take up too much space please add an option to hide them
__label__5 great for reminders
__label__5 i like so much but i have a advice like if you make completed task go down automatically
__label__3 please add a transparent widet swipe to finish tasks would also be nice it would be really great if we could add comments to individual tasks
__label__3 lacking in features compared to competition like ticktick todoist etc
__label__3 great app i only have one complaint the tavern system doesn't work i went on vacation and knew i wouldn't be able to complete my dailies or even open the app for that matter so i entered the tavern thinking i was safe for the couple weeks i'd be gone i just reopened the app and it told me i had died twice took all of my gold two of my items and decreased two levels honestly considering deleting the app now as i had over 100 gold saved and lost a piece of rare equipment
__label__4 motivating app would love it if it had more functional tools
__label__1 bekar
__label__4 useful program could be the center of my daily activities would be better smoother more integration with gmail and google calendar with again better easy even default 'scheduled follow ups' on same screen category priority time date no less important drag and drop tasks onto other categorical tasks to create a categorical hierarchy based on time date priority level in the task then instantly shows in google calendar with a simple mouse over 'zoom to task' in the calendar
__label__1 since microsoft have taken over it is rubbish we had wonderlist on 3 devices and to do wont even sync the 3 devices the same time to look for a new app
__label__5 awesome app
__label__4 i liked the app very much i signed up and so with the hope that my to do list would sync with all devices but when i reinstalled the up after cleaning my phone everything disappeared
__label__3 does not seem to work with google calendar i see no reason to give them my payment info for a free premium trial i managed to add the google calendar it took all the events bur not the reminders in calendar i still won't use this as it seems to be a replacement interface but i like the google display better i don't need to pay this much for few benefits to me i have not found anything that i like yet either
"__label__3 great concept but too buggy my brother had the same problem so he 
uninstalled it"
__label__3 i'm shocked there isn't a free trial period for this app all the things that i'm looking for are premium features and aren't unlocked without a subscription as a rule i do not subscribe to anything unless i am confident it will add value a trial would help me make that assessment
__label__5 amazing app thank you
__label__5 nice application you can update everyday the progress report gives extra motivation which we can see everyday we can set the goal target what we want to achieve there is forum too where people will help you if you have any doubt
__label__4 its pretty good
__label__3 app is easy to use but there are 2 features i find annoying when i add calendar items that i have entered multiple times before i would like the event data to default to the same data usually used for this event even when i'm adding an event for the 50th time i have to overlay the time duration reminder the other is that my reminders don't always remind me take today for example i would like them to keep reminding me until i clear them even if that takes all day
__label__4 great app reliable and useful however would be great if the kanban view was also available on mobile other than that i'm very satisfied with the app
__label__3 the font is too small to be useful
__label__3 seems laggy moving between lists and tabs after the latest update no way to delete a parent list without manually deleting all sublists first edit i see the delete option for subtasks but how do you delete sublists and parent lists i understand it's a hobby project and i appreciate that just making sure i'm not missing something
__label__2 would even pay advertise but i am not able to see in one view when future stuff is taking place
__label__3 unable to edit the day you want to do your habit unless i delete and recreate the habit which means i would lose my past statistics
__label__5 this is the best app i've ever seen to help with achieving your goals it's so awesome and really well set out
__label__1 for today bottom sheet keeps coming and going in a loop
__label__3 i've used this app before and i like it the only issue is there are no breaks it's kind of difficult to study and have no breaks
__label__3 a decent to do list app except for the ads i understand ads are necessary and accept that but forced full screen ads with sound that even when they are done don't let you close them and force you to the play store if you back up out of the play store the ad starts all over again
__label__1 if this was free yeah i'd totally use this who honestly wants to pay to keep track of your life wth
__label__3 it's ok
__label__3 timer not working when screen locked
__label__3 this is ok but it required bunch of upgrade and some new features will keep it but wait till is it perfect
__label__3 been using for a while now getting buggy needs update
__label__1 ruined a perfectly good app add task above below features have been removed when i create a new task it goes all the way to the bottom of the list i have to then drag it all the way back up to the top of the list of 100 tasks app is now useless
__label__4 good tracker but with subscription based model
__label__5 easy to use this is main issue with analogues
__label__2 the team fixed importing bookmarked tasks from wunderlist since about a year ago after using todo for couple days i can say it's almost on par with wunderlist but given that it's advertised as a replacement developed by the same team it's frustrating that not all behavior was backported no quickly prioritizing tasks by toggling bookmark state no list selection and delete hard to deal with duplicate lists after importing custom sorting so you add a task via widget but cannot see it
__label__3 the app is great but there is a one mistake there is no way to sing tasks as an unfinished tasks not deleted or compete it and the next task in repeated tasks never appear until i complete the overdue tasks
__label__4 very good been using for a few years now the synch function is temperamental lately perhaps an update changed something
__label__4 the free version is very good so far most features are free ive only used a week but if this app continues to be as useful i'll consider premium soon
__label__1 don't install this app this is forgery i've used this app for more than 2 years when i changed my mobile phone i couldn't login when i logged in it says this email account is not in our database i have the mail to prove that i had had the account in the app i mailed the company 4 5 times but there's no reply 2 years of my habit data is lost
__label__3 widget i add on home screen doesn't work when i'm offline
__label__4 تطبيق رائع جدا ومحفز للعمل كل الشكر والتقدير والاحترام لهيئة تصميم البرنامج
__label__2 so it was good until yesterday whenever i tap on the store it keeps refreshing and never opens i can't unlock any tree or even check them out i sent a picture thank you for the quick response
__label__5 very helpful to organize your days
__label__1 my mobile is getting switched off after installing it worked fine on 1st day of installing please fix it
__label__1 i have been trying to download the app but its just not happening please look into it
__label__4 not very expressive frame for activity descriptions must be in the first stages of development guilds look incredible diverse very surprising it is a social app seems the leveling function is standard gaming and well embedded hope open sourcing it make it better fit passing habits to to do would be desirable
__label__5
__label__1 is there a way to rollback previous ui the new ui introduces more clicks for the same action which decrease my productivity if i need to modify the name and due date for the same task i need to save twice instead of one time previous design
__label__4 love it
__label__5 aplikasi ini sangat membantu
__label__4 i like the app very helpful for lots of things however i've lost my account twice i've had to uninstall it and recreate my account very good otherwise tho
__label__3 the hourly reminders don't work properly they show up sometimes and sometimes they don't it's unreliable that way otherwise the app is quite nice
__label__5 wow too good
__label__2 i was testing this to replace fabulous so far the notifications are not persistent enough fabulous is able to wake me up in the morning
__label__4 clean easy interface connected to an alexa skill allows listings to sync the planning side of things i am still trying to daisy chain to do alexa and outlook so i get a mutable event horizon where i input by voice and have the outlook toolset available
__label__5 the best time managing app easy to use
"__label__3 would love to have collaborative editing and sharing of list so that i can 
create list and share it to my sons phone so it will be in his task list 
otherwise great app"
__label__1 i never leave reviews i was so disappointed when i heard microsoft was killing the wunderlist app why not just copy the functionality of wunderlist exactly they had the formula right it was simple and easy to use everything microsoft is doing is so clunky
__label__3 great app but there are constant bugs in the widget cannot add tasks from the widget selecting the list to display in the widget is too sensitive and often redirects you back to the app instead of the list select drop down
__label__4 it's a really good app it helps you keep track your meeting or work and it is really good for students they can manage there time really well with this app and the good thing about this is that it reminds you 15 min earlier that the timer
__label__3 when we install this app and use for the first time it works perfectly but next day when you try to open this app it gets stopped i tried multiple of time and no improvmnt
__label__5 love the app easily modifiable for making good habits daily routines and checklists and fun to do with friends thank you for the your response below the link allows you to review your history this has been very helpful for me in realizing where my weaknesses and strengths are my last wish is to allow friends to see your tasks and completions for encouragement
__label__3 the app continues to improve but it lacks one feature for me the ability to turn off the pop up i get on my screen every morning to tell me it's ready to plan my day let me make this clear i don't want you to plan my day so stop telling me to do it i've tried turning off all notifications but no luck and everywhere i go on the app it tries to sell me the premium upgrade just annoying
__label__4 this app is just simply awesome just one thing i missed was notification sound it won't ring when a task is due as a result i won't be able to know about the task if i ain't using my phone
__label__2 i tried it years ago and never really got it going then i switched to wunderlist and became an organized machine now wunderlist is being retired so i thought i'd try again guessing it would be much better by now and that my ability to use it to my advantage would be vastly improved nope no ability for folders or some other way to group lists together so i don't have to flip through all my lists to find the one i want not even a list view to make them easier to find
__label__3 it is really different and essential idea but unfortunatly in my phone you can come out of the app without destroying your tree
__label__3 not bad
__label__3 why it is not giving me notifications for dailies
__label__2 worse than wunderlist no drag and drop of tasks and a poor selection of themes weekly view should allow segmentation by day instead of lumping five days together
__label__4 would have been a five star had something as simple as a color theme change not came with a price seriously i have to pay premium prices just to go into dark mode if i was going to pay i'm most certainly not paying now that's just too petty a thing however great concept guys
__label__5 simple amazing if you want to change a habit for a good one use this app life changing
"__label__3 nearly perfect in terms of design usability the overall concept and user 
experience matches what i need i would rate it four stars if sync to 
cloud other devices was added and five stars if sharing collaboration was 
possible"
__label__3 notifications are annoying and not customizable was getting them for not having any tasks for the day i turned off notifications via my android settings and am still getting impossible to turn off pop up notification that blocks whatever app i am on app is fine otherwise but not for me
__label__1 no reminders
__label__1 stopped
__label__4 a great idea and the app itself has been improved a fair bit but still a little bit too slow to respond to give five stars seems a bit like server congestion maybe
__label__5 a fun and beautiful way to organize your life i'm a huge fan
__label__3 sticky notification bar should show task according to the up next time strictly rather its showing randomly
__label__3 its a great app in general just want a couple of tweaks that would make using it more streamlined the biggest thing is i have goals that increase incrementally every day i would love to have a way to have a yes or no that shows that incremental adjustment also when inputting numerically set goals i want to be able to just start typing the number and have it replace the default 0 0 without placing the cursor and backspacing to enter a result still the interface is otherwise great
__label__3 how can i delete priorities someone please answer me also please make a feature where we can choose to check subtasks off through check boxes as well and a feature that lets us choose the colour of the to do list when it's open as well also headers within the lists themselves just to divide tasks i will change my rating to a 5 star then thank you for reading this
__label__3 great job on the app for improvements sake i would make the lists have a font size option or something where if the 'items' in the to do list are more than a few words they can look more organized given that the square resides in the middle of the 'to do item' to me they seem a bit crammed together
__label__4 how to set the widget on my home screen
__label__5 simple and easy to use
__label__1 doesn't popup reminder anymore with android 10 update revert by support claiming its purely android 10 issue isn't true there are apps which continue to have pop ups shared with developer who refuses to acknowledge this only give defense of android issue
__label__5 works great looks great excellent features everything i need in a calendar widget i don't actually use the app
__label__5 just woww
__label__2 dont like the layout not very user friendly and you can't see your completed tasks unless you pay a monthly fee that is overpriced don't recommend there are much better apps that cost much less or are free
__label__1 i used this calander app for years and found it to be excellent but recently it started playing full page video ads making accessing information on the fly unreliable i'm sure the paid version is still great but i cant recommend using this as a free calander app anymore
__label__3 a good app but does not show full month tasks and that makes it hard to plan ahead or look back to previous events
__label__3 its good
__label__4 good apps for time allocation in a different design mode
__label__3 i love love love the app and ever since i bought the pro version i've had it running in the background and was still able to access other apps i use for studying the problem is i can't access the store where you can buy various different trees so all i'm stuck with are the defaults and the wisteria tree i redeemed five stars if you can fix this problem
__label__2 app not bad but very limited unless you pay downloaded this app after reading in the news about it's whatsapp integration that is only available if you pay without the paid for aspects this application is like any other generic calender app
__label__3 i really like the sophisticated display and the level of personalisation you can make it would get 5 stars but the default text colour for the month display widget is a dark grey that is too dark to read when using the dark theme i have to go through every entry to change them individually to a light grey so i can actually read it in the widget any help
"__label__4 i don't quite get the categories for tasks i hope there is an option to 
hide it or remove it"
__label__3 very nice app but the simple features that many other apps has for free cost money on this app so why would a pay for somethings that it should be free
__label__1 the planner does not work well when i set it as every monday it shows different days
__label__3 unable to set custom notification sound it uses default sound even after changing others looks good
__label__3 too many long advertisements when i need my calendar
__label__1 i have been using this app for nearly a year however lately it has been crashing so frequently that i reinstalled it few times in two days it keep crashing again and again it also sometimes doesn't count the time and resets itself i am very disappointed that i will stop using it unfortunately if it doesn't get fixed
__label__4 i like it so far and i bought the 24 hours extension the only complain that i have is the buttons that sit on the four corners of the widget is very hard to precisely click i got very frustrated every time i try to click it most of the time it'lll trigger to move the widget itself
__label__4 very helpful a bit hard to completely customize but much of that is due to how much flexibility there is
__label__3 no need for floating button on widget i think add button on widget needs to be smaller also possible to make the widget until 2x2
__label__1 i was looking for a class schedule app and this was not it
__label__3 ugh too complicated just want plain priority list uninstalling
__label__2 original review frequent intrusive pop under links open a web browser where they subject customers to crazy ads 12 12 18 response to dev's the pop under ads happen as a result of selecting a response to an app message related to the action taken within the app i am not actively selecting an ad i am not passively selecting an ad i am not accidentally selecting an ad this is either a bug or an intentionally developed annoyance
__label__5 the original app wunderlist was a bit better but this one still does the job it's particularly interesting for unorganized households
__label__1 used to like it but now the shopping basket is missing and i can't make a grocery list anymore very annoying
__label__2 cool concept but an app like this requires too much focus of its own which only pulls attention away from your intended project maybe it would be better with a more comprehensive tutorial but i doubt it i prefer something straightforward like screen time
__label__3 its ok i've started using it when i found out wunderlist was going to end and be absorbed by microsoft i've used wunderlist for years so its a change what i miss most is being able to manually adjust how my items were arranged i don't care much for alphabetical ordering and going from oldest to newest or newest to oldest as the only other available options are a bit annoying i liked being able to sort my items as needed on the daily but maybe that's just me i love'd my lists and now meh
__label__3 if a task is due while the phone is off you won't get notification after the phone is turned on also snoozing a recurrent task changes the time for a the whole series
__label__2 disappointing i have been happily using this application for years now but the last few updates appear to have caused more problems than they fixed one example when you create an event that's further away than a month the app will at all times change the date and time to incorrect ones it has done this each time for me over the last months changing the dates and times for no reason you can imagine this is a deal breaker for a planning app
__label__4 great for general use and getting better
__label__1 sync not working anymore
__label__1 do not download this app i unsubscribed from premium before they could charge me because i decided i couldn't afford it i'm a broke college student they took my money anyway i tried to contact them they don't have a number to call so i emailed them they told my they didn't charge me at all i asked them to give me the contact info of their financer so that i could send them my bank statement and they ignored my emails they stole my money don't use this app it is not worth it
__label__2 waa supposed to try premium but my payment won't push through it keeps saying that i have the wrong google password when in fact i inputed the correct one
__label__5 i love this app i can set times and my tasks will appear in that order i can set several reminders when i click done the task goes to the bottom under completed the app keeps track of my productivity i like that i can group my tasks in categories i especially like that when i click on the date all of my tasks automatically appear i don't have to be overwhelmed by how much i have to do i just take 1 task at a time there's even a promo timer embedded to help me stay on track
__label__3 the free app is too limited other than that it's a good one
__label__4 this app helps me keep track of my daily tasks at work
__label__5 love it exactly what i was looking for nice looking very functional and it can go on my homescreen with check boxes 10 10
__label__5 would be perfect if there was a calendar view update it is the perfect app to manage my to do lists for every aspect of my life the ability to have sub lists based on priorities and the calendar view make this app the best
__label__3 i have written 0 or 15 minutes for a 30 minute target the app still registers it as part of a streak even after i delete the entry seems like its just ignoring what i tell it also what i really want is an hours per week target
__label__4 great so far two requests for devs i just started using timetune and i like it has most options i was looking for to help my time management and utilize time blocking requests 1 whole week view i'm looking for healthy rhythm and repetition in my weekly routine as an independent worker difficult to visualize when i can only view one day 2 sharing i'd love to be able to share my routine with my wife through this app perhaps two ways to share by whole routine and by tag
__label__3 idea is cool not for everyone i'm removing 1 star for not having any charts for the habits themselves and 1 star for the funky behavior of tasks screen i'd edit some task from dailies and after it's saved i'm placed back to habits for example
__label__4 notifications fixed app keeps getting better i'd like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements edit nice d another thing i would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked example unlocked 01 04 2019 so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab thanks for this app
__label__3 its serves a purpose
__label__3 slightly glitchy and missing some features you'd expect syncing between desktop web and mobile is nice missing parity between all though
__label__3 the fact there are no predefined tasks makes it super hard to use or rather this will work if user can just define the task quest easily or maybe we can import by purchasing some set of quests for me it is still quite confusing and hard to manage with all the options offered would be use it furthere more if not too complicated
__label__1 very bad premium services developers are not taking care of this app anymore
__label__3 it is good to organise the tasks the only problem is i am not able to get reminders i am setting the reminder but it is but showing
__label__4 great app for succeeding with your good habits the widgets are especially useful since you are constantly reminded if you haven't completed one of your habits i also like the discussion page but i miss some sort of timestamp to show when the post comment was posted sometimes you reply on a post that has been dead for quite a while without knowing it
__label__4 thanks great app please add persian language
__label__3 how can i take the notes i have made and copy them over to my laptop i have looked to see where the notes save to but can't seem to find them anywhere please help me
__label__2 i like the way it's present itself but advantage if your not getting any notification ring in the system i allowed everything i needed too but still it's not working out
__label__5 even for me that i have android 5 in my phone is totally full option and useful dark theme and many necessary optional things make it best to do list ever
__label__5 best app to keep me up to date helps me remember all my tasks along with their due dates i tried many apps to help me remember my tasks as my memory is a bit weak but i must say that this app has best helped me i just loved it
__label__2 revised review sometimes we seek out apps to help with deficiencies or make life work out app was so great and so functional for months until a few days ago i was working around the changed now cumbersome reschedule edit rename tasks process but labels beyond a few characters are hidden now todoist labels was the thing for this app for me with efficiently visually seeing grouping tasks had made app ahead of many others app needs more display settings then to be usable again
__label__5 great use it daily quick and easy when i'm in a hurry would be nice to have a vehicle checklists etc
__label__3 sufficient for my needs simple to use
__label__5 wonderful app
__label__5 just got the app about a week ago after downloading and deleting multiple similar apps ticktick works great haven't had any problems with the app and it does everything it says it will do without asking you for additional money to use what was advertised as one of the features this app has really helped me get my life more organized
__label__1 ads too frequent didn't even finish setting up first days tasks
__label__2 i don't know why they changed it but i hate the fact that you can't type in the time anymore you have to scroll like you're on wheel of fortune or something that is the biggest pain in the behind ever invented i don't mind it if there's a option but this doesn't appear to give you a choice anymore please change it back
__label__5 paid for pro since i use this app almost exclusively all my other calendars are integrated into it i use it daily for events tasks and reminders
__label__2 good
__label__3 dont buy the premium the widgets don't work the reason i bought premium and i set up notifications for each hour to remind me of a task but the notifications only pop up if you open the app which render the notifications useless otherwise i enjoy the basic use of the app
__label__2 it was a great app but after a couple of days it crashed and stopped working so i had to uninstall it i'm reinstalling it let's see if it happens again
__label__1 does not integrate month calendar view and 24hrs view within the circular widget graphics it only shows 24hrs 12hrs in free version very restrictive the widget shows full info for one day and no info ahead unless you select a different day for the days ahead you need to leave the widget and work in a different environment why complicate your life find a calendar app you like stay with it come back to sectograph when and if the widget fully implements time and task management
__label__5 its a fabulous app really easy to use fun as it offers colourful background
__label__5 very rewarding enjoyable past time
__label__4 good app
__label__3 not bad but not great pros 3rd party calendar sync time line view icons colour options to customise cons can't sync devices no task list or tick box more options needed such as daily time line view font size highlight current day editing isn't easy i think the whole app including widget could have a neater tidier look overall it's not very intuitive needs more options flexibity it has some way to go i've got premium btw
__label__1 went to migrate wunderlist to the new to do and it just wiped all my info clean i lost everything in wunderlist and none of it made it to the new to do app hmm
__label__1 terrible i've had to move from wunderlist and the syncing doesn't work which is so important for me also can't set it to add items to the top of the list have to scroll aaaallll the way to the bottom to have to find item and move it to correct location
__label__2 i could'nt open the app it says unfortunately forest has stopped working
__label__5 great app for tracking whatever it is that you want to develop as a regular habit clean interface and very easy to set up new habits like exercising on set days not smoking or taking medicine the 'streaks' length percentage success are good motivators and give you a nice visual reference for how well you're doing
__label__5 a little gem of an app it is simple to use yet offers plenty of options for getting yourself organised and for list management i find the 4 level hierarchy so useful the hierarchies are groups lists tasks steps but you can leave out level 1 if a particular list is not part of a group i also like the fact that my day is managed manually as this ensures that i actually bother to review it integration with office 365 makes your plan available on all your devices and gives you a backup
__label__2 unable to import any data from the csv file in cloud no option to get any data back bought premium and im not happy beware
__label__4 i use this for my honey do hardware store and movies lists
__label__2 wunderlist is far better this is no way close
__label__5 awesome creativity
__label__4 the simplicity is nice but sometimes i want something with more detail i use it in conjunction with another app if i don't have a lot of time to enter info it's great for that i like that you can change the background to dark which isn't so jarring if you are using just before bed and are trying to avoid being stimulated by technology i do wish though that you could change the setup of a habit entered between a simple click or entering more detail right now you have to create a new habit if you want to change but then that changes your stats
__label__2 statistical data for daily routine and check marks for completed or missed routines are expected
__label__2 recent update causes the widget to crash every time i go to my homescreen on a pretty common samsung tablet
__label__3 why do you get rid of things after making users use to it what happened to the press and hold to multi select why can't i type 'tomorrow' and click backspace to remove the auto calendar add like i was able to before the update thanks for the new features but don't take out the old ones or at least add an option in the settings to keep things the same
__label__2 really beautiful and great idea it is unfortunate for anyone who doesn't buy into all things google and don't use google callander in this day building your app to only one service is not a good idea unless it's for the iphone now if i could get my work calendar on this app wow what a great way to visualize your day just playing with the demo showed me the power of this style
__label__2 was fine until the last couple of days when the layout turned squirrelly on my android tablet seems okay on my smart phone still i will not purchase full version unless the version for my tablet goes back to matching the screen layout on my cell
__label__3 hey i've been using it pretty good but today when i played the forest rain and locked my phone the white noice didn't work like it has some problem
__label__5 does everything i need
__label__3 this is hands down the best personal planning app i've ever come across that being said it's basically unusable on android the view jumps to the top of the day's task list at random making it easy to accidentally check off the wrong task it takes minutes to load anything when you try to access the rest of the app through the back arrow at the top left and on occasion tasks will duplicate themselves multiple times with different parameters i use it on my ipad with no trouble at all
__label__5 wonderful app and great customer service this app has replaced 2 or 3 of my old apps this is the most customizable list app i have found colors can change tasks can be rearranged within a list lists can be rearranged tasks don't need a due date or time but can be assigned either along with notifications or alarms if desired i had a small issue with sound emailed support problem solved in just a few days excellent
__label__4 mostly works well as replacement for wunderlist import worked well from wunderlist however i wish that you had a choice to automatically add new items at the top of the list instead of the bottom you can sort by date added but then you lose your customized order of items
__label__3 would be good if it is made offline atleast for todos
__label__2 great concept but riddled with bugs sign up was horribly difficult with the servers not responding and the app failing to realize i was trying to change my username and display names app reset at around 7 00 pm instead of at midnight of my time zone which i had double checked beforehand i want to like it but this is becoming downright frustrating
__label__4 been using this app for a short while so far so good it's purely a visual of events time and alarms while all the actual event management still happens through the google calendar app and which i think is brilliant still figuring out the app like how does one track time on it
__label__3 this app is great i've used it for a year now but i find that the app was preferable prior to the update i really don't like that the plant only changes or evolves with at least 60 minutes now it feels like anything under that does not matter if i focus for 10 minutes or 50 minutes makes no difference in the app which is a little demotivating please consider changing this other than that phenomenal app
__label__4 i really like this app for the most part but i really don't like how the month view in app and on the widget don't actually list out what you have on that day just colored dots would really like to be able to have this since i paid for the pro version please consider
__label__1 sorry you have reached the use limit on subtasks upgrade now and add up to 199 subtasks per task are you serious guys pro version for more subtasks why 199 why not unlimited
__label__3 game is great can give back results where you put in effort however when i last tried to put in a task everything was empty and i cant seem to log back in
__label__1 keeps turning off even when set to the proper settings i made sure it was not an issue with my phone i set the settings of the app to their adequate setting and yet the app still does not work when my phone if off
__label__5 this app has really helped me focus on my school work as times are now with the e learning situation it's done wonders for me
__label__1 too many errors
__label__5 awesome app very helpful for forming habbits thank you for this wonderful app
__label__5 incredibly useful app very good for making lists not that great for habit forming but that's fine
__label__1 basic functionality of wunderlist still missing
__label__3 i have suceeded 100 and indicates so in the tracker but only says 87 on the app one of my goals was yoga on mondays not sure if it is penalizing me for the other days
__label__3 did love this app but since the update i seem to lose tasks now i do not trust the lists i have created
__label__3 the app doesn't have audio alerts it only displays a notification after you unlock your phone please add audio alert feature as well so that you can get an alert even when you're not using your phone
__label__3 i liked a lot about this app but unfortunately there is no feature to repeat tasks hourly daily weekly etc which is kinda vital for me without it i can't recommend this app much as i hate todoist's subscription model they seem to be the leader as of right now
__label__3 pretty good but when i'm adding a reminder please don't assume the time will earlier in the day than the current time also it goes a little haywire during the transition to from daylight savings time
__label__3 lot of difficult methods to organize
__label__3 it's ok but a bit too simple and the inspirational messages don't change not really very motivating to use this app compared to my previous habit tracker the app's look doesn't come exciting to look at as well
__label__5 love this app it helps to keep me focused while studying you get really invested in planting your trees and seeing them live which is a good deterrent from checking social media and texts i enjoy how you can work towards new types of plants and get some variety in your forest i definitely recommend to anyone looking for a little push with no real consequences to stay focused
__label__3 i did like the app after i'm reinstalling the app what happens to my in app purchase i had purchased the app rt now which i'm using is it the paid one or free one do i need to pay for premium again
__label__1 i used to like even love this app it was great now though every time i add an event on my calendar an ad comes up and stays there until it is finished it's awful so far the ads have not been inappropriate just annoying i don't think that going to the pro version would fix this i don't even know how to find the pro version to purchase as it doesn't show up in the play store super frustrating i don't want to find another app i just want this one to work without the silly ads
__label__1 ads with free apps are acceptable but fullscreen non skippable ads blocking the entire screen for 20 seconds are not awful user experience google has recently removed 600 android apps from play store because of disruptive fullscreen ads this app may be the next one to be removed not recommended
__label__2 i'm adding a star because the import from wunderlist was seamless but otherwise the fact that i cannot drag and drop reorganize stuff manually absolutely sucks soon as i can get my lists imported into something else i'll be moving on
__label__5 keeps me organised very happy with would be even better if it had functions to support dsylexia sufferes
"__label__3 the app is really neat it would be great if there was the option to pause 
timers"
__label__5 this is a good app for note and everything as you want i am so happy for using this app but it is more better if have search options so currently improve it
__label__3 please make it possible to change the start day of the week i want my calendar to start the week with monday instead of sunday thanks
__label__3 many features are locked and require a subscription did not want to pay without trying and even given the limitation the trial period is limited to 1 week this is too harsh uninstalling
__label__5 great and even better for adhd
__label__4 offers much more flexibility and i'm enjoying the new updates the one thing i would like for 5 star rating is the ability to strike through appointments that are cancelled which was possible in the palm pilot and similar to the completed tasks that once you have ticked them off it will strike through the item
__label__3 i have not been using app for very long therefore the 3 star rating after some use i will return to rate again
__label__3 habit syncing not working on paid version app is great but after phone resets and all my habits data of 2 months is lost and the app is showing i don't have a internet connection even though i am writing this review on same internet connection but other than that app works great the widget is great and i use it daily
__label__2 the app is a little confusing in the way it works and it is a little ridiculous to pay 3 a month just to see a calendar
__label__3 i love the concept but i would love to see a list of suggested 'to dos' cuz i can never think of things to do
__label__2 good design simple and clear but with the option to dig down for more details however they don't respond to emails and haven't released an update in over a year seems like this project was abandoned
__label__3 i really like the visual round of this app however i would love to be able to personalise it more easily
__label__4 useful but slow to synchronize across devices could evolve to become even more uh ser friendly
__label__1 thought this was a great app until i realized it doesn't get rid of the checked daily tasks to remind you of the new daily tasks and that is exactly what i was using this for daily tasks i need done when i check remove checked tasks it does nothing and those checked tasks just stay there
__label__4 easy to use a direct link with other apps google calendar outlook calendar would be a great add on
__label__2 coming over from wunderlist started the import and its been importing for 2 days only half my lists have transferred seems hung
__label__4 perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist it has profound customization ability the reward system is more complex than competitors for someone with significant attention issues this has really helped me to feel invested subtasks and autofails are great features would be 5 stars if developers 1 allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2 made tutorial videos full functionality will be a learning curve for many
__label__1 i've used this app for years and have loved it up until now now i get full page ads that sit there for 5 seconds and disrupt what i'm doing i don't mind a full page ad that i can back out of or scrolling ads at the bottom but to force me to watch a 5 second ad is not reasonable seems like they're forcing you to pay up or move on to another app if this continues i'll find another app
__label__2 why can't task assigned for today are automatically in my day
__label__1 used this app for years but i can not tolerate the recent full page video ads that pop up after every calendar entry i use the free version which i know is sponsored by ad the recent updates allow intrusive excess ads that you can even skip and i can't renter the app to verify my calendar entry was added modified corrected the developer or owner has really overstepped with the recent updates and ads i'm going back to the free google app instead i hope you push out a new update before y
__label__2 my wife and i used wonderlist for years to share grocery lists to do's packing lists etc the transition into microsoft to do could not have been more painful duplicate imports and no sharing between work personal accounts made the move harder than it should be but the most frustrating thing i can no longer click and drag to order items in a list i be in the grocery store runnin around like a psycho cuz my list be all scrambled and that's before i even look for toilet paper
__label__3 there are bugs that break the immersion for me it's not as responsive as it looks and the design should be worked out in the app to complete a challenge i need to post my goal on the chat fine but then i cannot access the chat room through the app and i need to use the browser for that please improve the user xp
__label__4 ticktick has much better widget customization
__label__3 does not show dates of bookings as it used to detect from emails
__label__1 i bought pro version and paid twice still haven't been delivered the pro features
__label__2 too complex
__label__3 design is awesome but app should notify even if it's not running in background
__label__5 i am loving this and plan to buy it do you intend to add a widget for phones and tablets
__label__5 if you want to organize your day week this is the app for you
__label__1 shows annoying full screen ads that pop up from time to time
__label__4 it helps me organize my life
__label__1 the new version is so complicated loved the old one it was simple and easy and quick to use it was perfect
__label__4 recording the amount of when the day is successful need to be easier
__label__2 i like this app but its useless if i go on a different app it just gives me a warning and carries on would be better if there was some sort of consequence for using other apps
__label__3 needs premium subscription for dark mode that is so greedy dark mode is a basic requirement in 2019 charging for different themes is understandable but for dark mode edit i have uninstalled your app for the moment thank you for your consideration i'll change my ratings from 1 to 3 for now
__label__3 the app crashes very often you also have to restart the app every time for a reward to show up in your inventory
__label__3 has good features although takes a very long time to figure out how the lists work
__label__5 i love dnd so i love this app too
__label__2 i like the overall app it is the best but even after setting the reminder for my habits i do not receive any notification or reminder i have checked with my notification settings for this app and it is turned on
__label__3 when i tried to load in my own alarm sound it wouldn't let me
__label__3 small but significant issue for me i like to look ahead at the events and tasks or whatever i put into the calendar widget in advance but i wish there was a way to automatically go back like a button to today's date and events afterwards because i don't like having to manually click on the arrows to go back to today's date after i view my future months and events overall awesome app hopefully something like this gets added i really want to continue using this app thank you
__label__4 the app is perfect but one tiny problem the reload icon is sometimes peeking out at the bottom of the list title
__label__2 works well but free version only gives you three total lists
__label__5 i am very bad at just starting something and staying with it for a decent amount of time or at least enough to get it done this really really helps me in that aspect because i can set reminders i got the fancy version that will ping at me whenever i want them to to tell me to work on stuff also every time i look at my little baby tree growing i kno okay i just have this much longer and then i can take a break and honestly that is helping me it is very cute and user friendly 10 10
__label__5 good application and very useful
__label__4 great app so far very user friendly would love an option to duplicate a hole list found an option to duplicate sub list only thanks
__label__3 the app and widɡet are very ɡood will change to 5 start when i can be able to add task using google assistant
__label__5 love love love this app i have been a paper planner lover for 30 years and i just switched to artful agenda and i couldn't be more pleased try it you'll love it
__label__2 perfect app except for 12 hour sync with google calendar
__label__3 good
__label__4 i'm enjoying the user interface it's has a nice aesthetic and more importantly has pretty much everything i need for putting down my tasks however the widget keeps freezing on my home page and my completed tasks for a particular day don't show up in the app for that day
__label__5 this is a brilliant little app i frequently struggle with executive dysfunction and this app really helps me get things done
__label__3 i really love this app with my busy schedule it's so great to have all my day's events plotted out in one great visual but it drains my battery like crazy i've lost 10 just typing this out i have to un install it please find a way to fix this so i can re install
__label__2 nested can be improved
__label__2 when you use the pomo timer it automatically starts counting down when you hit what task you want yo be working on there is no longer an icon where you can choose your white noise before starting the pomo and no way to pause the pomo once it starts so you can select your white noise i would like to be able to select the task i'm working on select what white noise i want and then start the pomo not everything automatically start
"__label__3 i like the idea especially the differentiation between dailies habits 
and to dos but i need to be able to see the history uninstalled will 
stick to daylio for now"
__label__5 this is a very easy to use app which allows you to customize the habits you're trying to change or add it allows you to set floor and ceiling goals within each habit and identifies your streaks it's fantastic
__label__3 it's great i love it
__label__4 taking off a star because i'm not sure where else to give feedback about the update i'm not a fan of having to click the drop down box in the corner in order to select multiple tasks at once especially because the task selection mode expires each time i make a single change to the selected tasks requiring me to then go into the drop down menu again to and then re select all of the tasks i just selected i really liked before how i could just select multiple tasks and make multiple changes to them at once in a few clicks i know this change was made to allow easy re ordering of tasks although i don't find this particularly helpful because i don't typically re order my tasks i would prefer that this is changed back or some kind of compromise is made so that it isn't so cumbersome to edit multiple tasks at once
__label__2 have used app for about 4 months now i can't get back into it keeps asking to sign in or create account won't let me do either time to dump it
__label__3 widget doesn't work properly pls fix it mi a2 lite android one
__label__3 does this app has sticky notes
__label__2 synced well with wunderlist to import lists but despite having reminders activated i get no notifications to remind me of upcoming tasks or events which makes this pretty redundant as a wunderlist replacement
__label__3 gd
__label__1 too complicated when putting on data i'll stay with my diary
__label__3 i have a big problem with this app daily routine doesn't repeat unless i complete it but somtimes i really could not complete it then ist stop why
__label__3 i have a big problem with this app daily routine doesn't repeat unless i complete it but somtimes i really could not complete it then it's stop repeating why plz fix it
__label__4 pretty good app to keep track of your bad habits you want to quit
__label__4 i love this app it helps me to stay focused while studying or to not use my phone when i'm around other people
__label__3 i am examining the possibility of transferring from the excellent wunderlist app to this microsoft to do it has been a challenge so far question how do i connect microsoft to do with google and samsung calendars just as we did with wunderlist thanks
__label__1 app became unusable with 11 06 18 update now the app takes 30 45 to open up after i click it and then i'm get an annoying ad that plays that i can't close for another 5 10 seconds i'll be finding a new calendar app
__label__1 as soon as i downloaded the app and made a new account i couldn't create a new character because under the body skin and other options to make your character was blank when i changed my display name i got a weird message for 'profile name' required the randomize button didn't even work for me either i left originally because there were many bugs with to do's and other things and i'm not confident it's functional past the character creator so i don't see a point to continue on the s10e
__label__3 i didn't use yet
__label__5 i love making lists and this application makes it much more accessible to do so i don't have to worry about which pocket my hand written list was last put into i don't have to worry about keeping a pen on me or losing it in the store for the tenth time lol and i dont have to check things off the app just checks it off for me with a single tap
__label__1 the app felt good enough for me to buy the yearly subscription which i did and paid th 15 it requested but a week later they charged me 17 more euros to my credit card for the same subscription and the same features so i basically paid 32 that is a scam and unless i get my 17 euros back i'm gonna keep the rating at one star
__label__2 revised review sometimes we seek out apps to help with deficiencies or make life work out app was so great and so functional for months until a few days ago i was working around the changed now cumbersome reschedule edit rename tasks process but labels beyond a few characters are hidden now todoist labels was the thing for this app for me with efficiently visually seeing grouping tasks had made app ahead of many others app needs more display settings then to be usable again
__label__3 in the widget why making the timeline of the whole week i think it will be more better if it is updated day by day but overall i like this app
__label__5 really simple and good application good job guys
__label__1 the widget doesn't work it appears only few minutes and then it disappears so i need to add ot manually again
__label__1 please delay shutting down wunderlist those who most rely on task lists cannot deal with a switch during this global crisis especially since to do is still lacking important features and sync and sharing are inconsistent
__label__3 great
__label__3 i have tried various time organizing apps and this one is best till now
__label__3 got it for he to know do of do not do me to my do do an do gone by hi do you do of do is well your name is on the list for the next few days and i will be there at the same time i don't have a whole lot of time to get the kids to the gum wall street journal and send it to you when i get home i will send you the link to the video of the puzzle in my room you have for me to get the kids to the gum wall street journal and send it to you when i get home i will send you the link to the video of
__label__1 used to be good but started showing full screen ads even when the app is not open currently unusable
__label__1 worst battery consuming app
__label__3 the app design looks nice and has good features this is a functional planner app i can access the week view in the free version though a prompt to upgrade to premium pops up but tasks cannot be set as recurring in the free version this is a main feature i'm looking for in a planner app also the look of the app cannot be customized stuck forever with that purple at the top of the screen there are other free apps that include these things
__label__3 i can't use the desktop app for windows it won't let me sign in with my google account please fix this furthermore some more themes for both the phone app and desktop app also a feature where the user can attach progressive pictures that correlate to their habit would be nice as well for premium users if i can have 99 attachment a day on premium why not this suggestion
__label__1 used the free version for years no issues didn't need the pro features then they started putting in ads not the kind that pop up along the bottom but ones that completely hijack the screen while you're trying to work worst bait and switch i've ever seen
__label__3 good
__label__1 very good app that is perfect for how i think but it kept asking me to rate the app for months now and i've always pushed later i'm sick of it asking me to rate the app
__label__1 ads
__label__2 no google tasks integration
__label__3 just downloaded so far great but i'm looking for an application i can use between two or more i e minors etc where i can send a task via messenger for example does this app upload if the other user also has task
__label__4 i subscribed for premium because i feel it's nice could you tell me where to check the status report and how to re organize the habits freely without any sorting order thanks edit please add option for statistics tab separately and need to work on showing them correctly on average
__label__4 a great app i just downloaded it and i already love it the only issue here is slight ui bugs november 2017 gets covered up by the tabs at the top and on the day section the date runs into the calender layout again great app but those errors make the app look less professional i would recommend rescaling the fragments so they fit better on the page as well as the toolbar definitely am recommending to friends though
__label__3 pomo timer is still glitchy
__label__5 very fun good game helpful and inspiring
__label__3 it's really unresponsive i have to tap 3 times so something opens or to check a box or anything too bad i really liked it but this is too annoying
__label__2 good ideas but not well implemented it gets tedious and boring after a while
__label__2 very confusing when problems occur the resolution isnt made clear
__label__3 reminder doesn't work
__label__1 full screen video ads i can live with banner ads but not this
__label__5 works perfectly incredibly fair subscription system that's worth the money but not necessary for a good user experience
__label__4 i luv it only downside is the adverts but the app is awesome
__label__5 this is app is absolutely awesome i had to spend a little time customizing all the various skills and characteristics but once it's set up it's absolutely fantastic
__label__5 love this calendar it has so many options to customize the widgets are awesome too
__label__4 great to do app seemless integration with windows would love to see the option to open the mobile app with the my day tab already open
__label__4 mostly a good app helps me keep on top of things morning notifications are a bloody lifesaver my only criticisms are that the free version is rather lacking in basic features at least for people like me coming from other apps also the top bar and the system status bar when in the app are different colors slightly and that's always bugged me
__label__3 i've been using habitica for a few years now and while i love the idea from a technical standpoint the mobile app is broken it feels like something you would have on your phone back when touchscreens were a new thing the most annoying bugs are party screen not updating after you accept a quest invitation so you're not sure if you accepted it spamming buffs sometimes reduces your mana without actually applying the buff and party chat not updating have to restart the app to see new messages
__label__1 unsupported doesnt contain sync feature wouldn't issue refund to the makers and google get on your hands and knees and repent to g d
__label__4 this app is awesome though it hangs most of tge time after i finish growing a tree but in overall i love it and i hope this app will have more features in the future
__label__3 nice app but why it doesnt sync with my google acount i mean when i add a new task it does not appear in my gmail task
__label__4 looks like a good app i've been using wunderlist for many years but i miss a lot sending emails to to do list like i was used to in wunderlist i use this feature in wunderlist and evernote a cannot imagine living without it otherwise i would give 5 flagging in outlook is not an option as i don't use outlook
__label__2 ui is nice but task lists are useless to me unless they let you set a start date i thought that since this was microsoft's task list app it would have similar features to the tasks in outlook
__label__3 seemed like a good app but doesn't always show your plans it's linked to my calender and i've added quite a few things for the month but it only shows on this app once and then disappears next time i look at it
__label__3 i quite like the app but it looks dreadful on a tablet and often forces me to change orientation from landscape to portrait to enter information
__label__5 this is awesome my life is easily organised with this app and i could look at everything and visualize in a whole calendar d
__label__2 i had to put in all the info
__label__5 best productivity app very intuitive to use and a must have for power users
__label__3 app looks very interesting and the way it is displayed is ibteresting but i am unable to place the widget on screen each time i try to add it to my homescreen it disappears i mean it does bot get placed on my home screen help me with this my phone is one plus 3 with android 7 1 noughat
__label__1 who puts ads on a calendar y'all that desperate for money smh
__label__5 the best organising app i have ever used very intuitive and very well designed it has been a huge help
__label__4 homescreen widget would be nice with more display option such as the progress bar etc
__label__4 love this app the only thing that is missing for me is the ability to long click on a day in any view and be able to give it a bespoke colour so i know that there is something important i need to be aware of on that date if that was there it would be 5 stars
"__label__3 app is good but have some bugs notification changes automatically to 
default after some time"
__label__2 ok concept but just takes way too much effort to make the core concept even work on a basic level kind of feels like this kind of an app needs some sort of ai with suggestions for every parameter and sync between different devices to get the basic functionality into usable state
__label__2 this app is good but it works only once or twice a day and then crashes a lot need to reinstall it to work again please fix this bug else i would have given 5 stars
__label__1 the idea behind the app is good although after paying for premium the promised cloud sync does not work several users mention the same issue there is no way of backup the data either i cannot see any feedback from devs here switched to a different app habits
__label__3 there's a very important feature missing to select and edit multiple tasks at once also the app could improve speed wise it feels a little slow and heavy specially with the transition animations otherwise 5 stars
__label__3 if there is some problem regarding some phones than you must overcome that rest of all things application is great
__label__3 you guys are doing a great job only thing i wish for is that you had a separate morning and night routine section also i think the grocery shopping thing should just be another app altogether i don't use it as i just use amazon pantry and walmart pickup
__label__1 premium support has not contacted me for 3 days and counting
__label__3 the app is pretty good and has good features however when i shared a grocery list with my fiance it wouldn't let him accept and it it sent him tons of emails regarding it literally 1 every few minutes for hours and i have no clue how to stop this without him just unsubscribing given that sharing is a big part of why i wanted the app it does put a damper on things for me
__label__2 kept getting an unknown error has occurred please try again later tried on several devices on my t3 connection had no problem with other apps immediately after leaving this one uninstalled sad cuz it looked great in re dev's reply yes i did that i made sure it was plugged in and turned on too i did take a look at the apk and i've found an alternative for me for right now thanks
__label__3 not as i required
__label__1 very expensive premium
__label__3 doesn't beat most others in it's free version and too costly in the paid
__label__2 it works well but i do not recall subscribing to a 28 year subscription i thought i purchased it until i saw that it was renewed for an additional 28 it's not good enough to justify that price
__label__2 i liked this app but stop deleting events i add on i can't keep re adding events every hour i'm getting frustrated and will have to uninstall unless it's corrected
__label__1 i bought premium and now i can't login to the app using facebook and i can't login any other way i get this message login failed you can't use facebook to log into this app or website because there's an issue with its implementation of facebook login
__label__4 lets me make nice lists for everything
__label__5 must download the app is very much useful it had helped me get on track when i wasn't in a position of self reflection
__label__4 very nice working space but the display of things can be a bit nicer
__label__5 first of all i am thrilled with the app if i know how it works is there a list of ready made tasks on the start screen there are some suggested ones when i press the plus button i actually expect a list with all possible tasks but instead of that i only have the possibility to create a new task at first i thought that i had to subscribe i have subscribed now but unfortunately it is still not possible now i have deleted all tasks from the start screen if i click on the plus there is still no list it comes again new task
__label__1 the premium version of the app does not sync across multiple devices i use an android phone and a chromebook and it still does not work don't bother with premium
__label__3 ive been using it up almost 2 years now its a good app which i always recommend friends and cowowkers to use it few suggestions update the sort for task lists so we can sort by other filters for team tasks probably add the chat feature
__label__4 havent been using it for a long time but so far so good however the paid version should have more features such a costomizing your own categories also the widget should be more customizable such as font size
__label__1 another app that fails to draw events correctly on day view if i have an event from 3 00 to 3 15 and another from 3 15 to 3 30 there should be drawn with a space between them no matter how much i am zoomed in they are not overlapping events so don't treat them like they are
__label__2 buggy as hell keeps duplicating events when i edit them leaving me with the old version and the new side by side i keep deleting the old one and it keeps coming back i'm irritated and i'm going to look elsewhere now i loved the original business calendar but after giving it more then a fair chance this version is a no go
__label__4 couldn't create my avatar at first but after that it worked fine
__label__4 buggy but awesome
__label__4 i just would like to have also the possibility to set and see the amount of time estimated per each task or group of tasks otherwise i am just in love for the app
__label__3 previous it working very fine but now there lots issue with the application eg if you had not complete yesterday task it wont allow you complete today tasks even reporting is not working
__label__2 recurring tasks are behind a pay wall ridiculous to have to pay a monthly subscription for such a simple feature app is a little ugly and not customisable
__label__3 now you get a 30sec ad whenever you create a new calendar entry still an excellent calendar
__label__1 i don't care for the dashboard
__label__3 it's ok when we imported our list from wunderlist the list was duplicated my husband and i share a list for shopping when we connected through this new app every item on the list was duplicated frustrating to clean up
__label__2 it amazes me how microsoft took over an amazing app like wundelist and ruined it completely it's a real pitty that wundelist will be discontinued in may 2020 if you don't believe me just move to do it and then have both apps on your phone till may you keep opening wundelist because of its user friendly interface and functions and the opposite is true with do it i moved to do it thinking that they keep it the same with improvements but i was wrong searching for new app already
__label__4 v good but complex
__label__4 i think its cute
__label__2 wish it didnt have to connect to the calandar i wanted to keep my phones calandar widget separate from this but its impossible disappointing
__label__4 nice app but can update a function such as we can add in an attachment like photo into the task or etc will be better
__label__4 love habitica i find the app often has one bug or another from update to update so can't really give 5 stars but the devs do a smashing job regardless so 4 stars from me
__label__2 timer don't follow exact minutes in case of 5min reminder it takes about 6 7 minutes to notify painful
__label__5 so far the app has functioned excellently i have not run into any issues it's very simple and straight forward however i do recommend you read the user start guide as you'll find out about not so intuitive functions which make everything not only more seamless but even simpler than before i would seriously recommend to anyone looking for a todo app i've been using the free version and no complaints and no ads definitely give it a try and you won't regret it
__label__3 very customizable and easy to use works great with google calendar but i can't get it to sync with my office 365 outlook account bummer
__label__5 this was fantastic for my daily workplan so easy to do i was up and running after 10 minutes very easy to edit like move tasks to next day or another date if not complete you can add real time to tasks helpful for setting up order of priority on list you can select those tasks that repeat and set them up it has an alarm reminder my husband downloaded it and can do many org things too get it
__label__3 its seem complex in the first time anyway can see all activity in the big picture
__label__5 easy good app so far i like it
__label__3 cute
__label__3 presently use for tasks reminders only but it's great needed support once and was very helpful and quick reducing to 3 stars they must've made some changes that i don't care for too many reminder steps and the reminder doesn't show up when it supposed to looking for new reminder app
__label__2 to complicated and let's you set things up only to then tell u it's not available
__label__5 started using habitica on january 1st of this year as a new year's resolution to manage my time and habits better and it's been a huge help especially love the party aspect and the way it adds social accountability to missing or hitting targets very pleased thank you for all the work that went into this app
__label__2 the new update is terrible why trees cost so much now where is the option to get double coins by watching advertisement
__label__3 looks promising but i can't create avatar due to this error path 'profile name' is required
__label__1 app is very buggy completed tasks keep showing up as not completed notification alarm won't work uninstalling
__label__3 the app is what you expect
__label__5 if you're a procrastinator this app will change your life i have a tendency to avoid the things i need to do by snacking or playing video games so this app has been perfect for me i'm great at making to do lists but suck at execution this app has helped me with so many areas of my life chores around the house my quality of work at my job i've even been using it to develop safer driving habits the community is also very supportive it's really fun to play with a friend and party up
__label__5 just getting started with this app but so far i love it great way to track good habits and bad
__label__1 purchased the premium the app stops sending notifications after some days i have to repeatedly open the app to get notifications waste of money
__label__4 this app is literally the only thing that reminds me to take my meds i love getting the notifications and tracking my progress so easily however i just upgraded to the pro version specifically for the sync capability and it does not work 1 star for 10 i would hope that the one feature i wanted would function like it's supposed to i'm not happy about that at all the home screen widget comes in handy so it's not a total loss but that alone is not worth the price please fix syncing
__label__3 still testing
__label__2 useless without pro
__label__1 this program makes my garmin connect provide a notification and buzz every 2 seconds to let me know that my tree is still growing can find no guidance on how to disable this
__label__4 very nice app for maintaining our schedule need to improve sechudule reminder not working properly
__label__3 i recently downloaded this app and paid for the premium subscription i like the app but i have two issues that are hindering its functionality the first is that the notifications slate quite buggy i have 3 different daily tasks which i've set to notify me when they start and i only receive my notifications sometimes the second is that my workweek is sunday thursday and i found out after speaking with their support that there is no option to set a non standard workweek
__label__2 best
__label__3 time zone doesn't work i have my phone in a different time zone than i live in and have managed to change most things to my home time zone this app allows me to change my time zone but it doesn't actually reflect the change anywhere the date and time of the app and events stay incorrect my phone is on taiwan time for now and i have set the app the preset for events and every individual event to mst but when i open the app or use the widget the dates show in taiwan time still
__label__1 there's one thing that makes me crazy about apps it's when their developers don't tell you up front what the cost is of after the free trial so i won't be trying this as much as i'd like to
__label__2 i downloaded this app today but there is a problem that makes me unable to see to do lists habits etc i really want to use this app but i can't do it when i can't see the options it would be great if you fixed it so i can use it
__label__4 havent been using it for a long time but so far so good however the paid version should have more features such a costomizing your own categories also the widget should be more customizable such as font size
__label__3 great app
__label__2 i bought the premium and i can't sync the data between my devices
__label__2 i love this app but it reads my texts i left one in draft and it suggested it as a todo item i couldn't find any way to get it to keep is eyes to itself not about it
__label__3 i use the widget quite a lot and i have found it really difficult to mark a task as completed it requires 3 4 clicks on the tick button to mark it is complete
__label__1 great app but only if it was an offline app i would've given it a five star please fix this
__label__3 it's just okay i much preferred wunderlist i'd give a 5 star rating if microsoft to do added new items to the top of the list not the bottom and allow you to move any item to the top by pressing the star on that item similar to wunderlist needless to say i'm gonna be using this app a whole lot less than i had used wunderlist until this is fixed it's a huge inconvenience for me to have to keep dragging each new item to the top of my lists which tend to be very long
__label__1 like many others the new big update has severely hindered my ability to use the app effectively what used to be simple is now cumbersome with a 3x increase in the number of clicks to accomplish simple tasks it wasn't broken why did you have to 'fix' it i'm hoping they roll back some of these changes if they don't i will probably need to look elsewhere for a todo app
__label__4 my all around power app this app has been so useful that i use it not just for tasks but also my calendar used to sync with google calendar but left that to be all ticktick now this app is right on the money
__label__3 bills
__label__3 sadly this is the best to do list i have seen very glitchy tasks done weeks ago magically show up and you have to delete them again a grocery list i didn't even want replicated itself 12 times my personal list replicated itself 13 times and when i deleted the second to last iteration of this it deleted everything i had ever typed into my lists calendar support only available on ipad and android phone not in browser window you have to trick the system into puting a date on items by setting a reminder and then going back in to deactivate the reminder i like that you can move items around however you want and that items left undone today stay in the today category instead of just floating out of the system it is odd that something as unfinished as this emerges as king of the hill in this category i would have thought that the global creativity and intelligence of humanity would have far surpassed this but apparently not
__label__2 i really like the app but i can't use it until calendar view is available and subtasks become visible from tasks level
__label__3 it could be absolutely great except my widget is blank when it shouldn't be and my notifications don't work however i love this app and think a lot of hard work went into it
__label__4 good
__label__5 one of the apps in my toolbox manages my time well has good features thanks for the developers
__label__2 had annoyances with the ui the font was too big for me and i couldn't see a lot of things at once and for all its gimmicks it's really just a simple app
__label__3 tried this app for a bit the logic is very different from what i need so the experience wasn't good this app focuses on routines and is built around this concept it was very confusing at first because it started with abstract ideas not what average joe is already familiar with e g calendar timeline and the entire experience just felt awkward for me all i want is see the day week month add to do items one by one and be able to turn any of these items into routines when i want to
__label__3 no auto custom tags really
__label__2 it was great before but lately it sends notifications whenever it likes it doesn't notify according to schedule anymore and now it doesn't notify at all
__label__3 just downloaded so far great but i'm looking for an application i can use between two or more i e minors etc where i can send a task via messenger for example does this app upload if the other user also has task
__label__4 their widgets had gotten better since my last review i really appreciate the calendar with the tasks on the side if there was a morning your day today or plan your day today alert in the morning that would make it even better i went to any do for that but their calendar and sync to my waze app was off so i came back lol
__label__3 no timing
__label__5 wonderful app unique and very useful great design and functionality
__label__1 max of 9 lists then you pay 3 bucks a month
__label__2 don't get any notification at all
__label__5 helps me remember things and keep them organized it can really work cross devices hassle free
__label__2 eh not great for a pay app
__label__3 it would have been better if one could use the app without having to log in
__label__4 love the app but i notice it skips a reminder from time to time
__label__4 love this app it helps me stay focused easy to use and also love seeing my forest
__label__3 useless as you can not group habits but gamifying idea is good maybe they will fix it
__label__1 app does not work
__label__4 fun way to track and reward yourself guilt free lots of personal calibration but the interface is nice my only problem is the lack of icons even in the premium section
__label__3 it have future if they make notes can be organize by category tasks can create sub task and fix bug when samsung dex enabled
__label__1 i love wunderlist unfortunately it will disappear in may 2020 and be replaced by this app me and my husband have installed the new app imported all our lists from wunderlist but we cannot share any of them not even the ones that we previously shared in wunderlist i hope they will fix the problem until may
__label__3 mostly works well but i am rather disappointed with the syncing issues my wife and i are experiencing i'm unsure as to what microsoft has changed from the wunderlist app that i've been forced to switch from but this app does not work as quickly and nicely as wunderlist did which i had been using for 2 to 3 years constantly because it worked so well please revise this app so that connectivity problems from servers can be solved i am unable to sync some all of my shared lists
__label__2 not worth of killing wunderlist some crucial features such as comments are missing in the app
__label__4 great app for my todos and calendar would give 5 starts if they fix the show in calendar only bug
__label__3 the app is great thank you for providing us this gem however we work in several devices we are missing out the multidevice option and for that reason we may migrante elsewhere hope it comes available thx
__label__4 ads have changed from a small bar at the bottom to a full page screen that you could close to a full screen video that you can't close until you watch the whole thing
__label__5 absolutely amazing app the best for to do lists
__label__5 this app really helps me when working on school at home we've been doing a lot of that bc of covid 19 i really suggest this app hint if you want a free tree from the store order them from least coins to greatest
__label__3 please allow ability to scroll to see all the tasks other than that i like the main features and the shopping list
__label__2 excited to try it out but the app crashes whenever i try to create or edit tasks
__label__4 after purchasing the pro version and having used this calendar app for almost 2 to 3 years now i have grown to truly love it it mimicks as close to the franklin covey planner's to any app out there i have found and this is what has drawn me to it i am increasing my rating to 4 stars because i have really had time to utilize all aspects of this calendar and i love that it will sink with my google calendar and other calendars i love this app i only wish it could print
__label__5 useful motivator to avoid phone usage even on the free version very helpful
__label__5 love it found it
__label__2 3 a month to use most of the app na features are nice but disappointed i can't just buy the app
__label__4 i like it
__label__2 great for neat month view unfortunately it has started notifying event reminders after the event not good
__label__2 certain pages don't fit on screen
__label__4 it was better before all the pay for features i use it while studying and it's very helpful
__label__3 have to subscribe to link to google calendars
__label__1 rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet
__label__2 this app is an excellent idea if only it worked i have been unable to move off the home screen without it crashing its a shame as it has a lot of potential
__label__4 very easy to use have all i need
__label__2 the app stop responding for many days already it is disturbing that it stops after 5 secs whenever i open the app still stopping
__label__3 i think the app is satisfaying my will but the pro version keeps a non ecard user not happy so im giving you 3 5 bcuz of this
__label__5 its a good app i liked its all features
__label__1 very expensive premium
__label__4 i really love this app i find myself wanting to make tasks for myself about it it has an incredibly clean ui and feels great to use the only issue i have with it is the pricing model for the pro version for 5 or 6 admittedly useful features there's a monthly subscription which personally i find to be ludicrous i'd willingly pay a one time charge but a monthly payment is just silly for this app
__label__3 hello forest i interest with this app to stay focus it work when i press back button and app will warn but there's some problems with other buttons forest don't detect when i press home button task button so i can open other app and my tree is still growing hope u can fix this or tell us why we still can press other buttons thanks
__label__5 5stars
__label__3 great app when it works but don't assume you will get any support when it doesn't always read our help files and that is it
__label__1 does not sync automatically very frustrating have to go in and sync now even though setting is set to sync every hour done with this app
__label__3 would be awesome if paid but free version too restricted it ain't worth it
__label__3 good app but you need to pay a subscription to use it fully there isn't an option to pay for the app outright which is a shame
__label__3 missing a few good features and isn't always the most stable of apps
__label__1 after adding task to the app it just doesn't shows up
__label__5 great app to track your daily tasks it is very customizable
__label__3 used to work great unfortunetly notifications no longer go off for ir making it useless have checked they are not blocked
"__label__2 repeat function does not work making the app useless as a task list might 
as well use my calendar almost missed a credit card payment because this 
app didn't repeat the task"
__label__5 easily the best task manager app out there while the rpg aspect is a huge plus the user is able to fully customize pretty much every little bit of the app to make it better suit their habits or soon to be habits
__label__1 after the last update i can't connect to the app anymore with my vpn turned on which is extremely annoying
__label__4 love it
__label__2 useless i dont want to purchase the app as this free version offers no good features the paid app might be better rating 2 just because of the feedback on user review
__label__3 overall a well designed app that i would otherwise use except for the lack of google assistant integration a la todoist
__label__5 love it user friendly and intuitive
__label__3 no signup option
__label__2 easy to use and understand i have an issue with the reminder settings if i set a time reminder then it drains my battery so i am not able to use this function otherwise i am happy
__label__5 easy to use and neat interface great supplement to sort your days out also a great reminder replacement for the long dead cortana
__label__5 really good and super helpful because of covid 19 there's a chance i won't be going to school for a couple months and i wanted an easy to follow routine to factor in my online courses for a minimum of 2 hours didn't do just that but i was actually able to fit in all my chores with more than enough free time to spare i really recommend the app and will definitely be telling my friends
__label__1 download it and then immediately uninstalled have to pay premium prices to get any features at all can't even set up reminders don't bother with this app
__label__4 heyyy dear developers love the app but have a issue in it idk if it is only with me the app doesn't show any reminder after 1 day of setting a habit goal only 1st day it does
__label__2 when i checklist today's note automatically overdue's note checked too what's wrong
__label__3 nice app it's just i feel their is always space for improvement
__label__5 very nice app i frequently used it since 2014 until now
__label__4 powerful and simple the only thing missing is integration with google calendar which i used for years and i do not see any option to migrate either so no backward search for the events calendar sharing and other integrations well task and project wise this is a powerhouse much more simple and well designed than google keep i've been using for years
__label__3 i wish one could back up his habits otherwise it a good straight forward app
__label__3 there are a lot of really cool feature with this app but i stopped using it almost as soon as i started because of one key missing feature the calendar view it's weird to me that a planner app doesn't have a calendar view it has a calendar sync option if you pay for it but i'm not going to buy it only to find out that is not what i want could also be greatly improved if it included tasks and projects really awesome functionality but missing some core essentials for me
__label__5 greatttt
__label__5 this app makes me want to accomplish my goals it's so useful and helpful because i don't want to break my streaks i find that i push my self to accomplish the daily habits i created in the app thank you dev
__label__5 inspired by today and tomorrow and my life is i can do the one i sent was her last name correctly lawson you in the people in and always and my lifetime ago i think it's the same time for you to come home now yes love in the people who went to sleep at my house i will be in touch with you in the morning and always my favorite person i know when you're ready to talk with me about working and i will there today yes sounds great idea for yes love love love love in the one who went to the people'sn
__label__5 good features and easy to use i hope i can see my tasks and events at the lock screen thanks
__label__3 it has reminders but would be great to show the due date as my reminders are often days before instead of on the due date itself and what heading it was put under so know which project's task it is
__label__3 it's no wunderlist needs a quick add button on the app's home screen reminder notifications disappeared when i opened the app i dislike that i am forced to use microsoft account to use the app other than these issues it's alright
__label__2 this app is causing me a lot of trouble whenever i close the app and open it again the app says that forest isn't working so i have to delete and download it again and use it 10 times a day and also i have paid premium membership i have an android phone
__label__1 todoist is the cornerstone of my organizational system i am an undergraduate student and use this app to manage my reading assignments exam schedule administrative deadlines etc sync with windows 10 desktop app is awesome i am a free user and would gladly pay a one time price for full features here but a monthly subscription is a turn off most recent update added check boxes which confused and altered the functionality of the widget which was wicked btw please add ability to turn off
__label__3 the app has started causing toasters to pop up frequently saying this widget will not be updated maximum memory is used for the same widgets i only have one instance of the widget running and plenty of free space i've removed it from my home screen for now the notifications are too annoying
__label__4 best pomodoro app there's only two things that i'd wish they included 1 i wish they allowed portrait mode so i can have my phone propped up sideways 2 could you guys please allow this app to take up the whole screen so i don't get distracted by notification icons or the time
__label__4 overall impressive app but it does not updated in real time always showing delayed time until manual update
__label__3 bills
__label__3 the interface is intuitive i am giving a three because my online data did not sync when i upgraded
__label__1 this app would get 5 stars as it is great for capturing and managing tasks however due to major flaw it gets 1 star i have accidentally deleted long detailed lists when trying to delete a task and there is no deleted item recovery feature which means i have lost work the notification feature does not clearly differentiate between task list and task allows this to happen if fixed this would be a fantastic app but these flaws means using this app results in rework and frustration for now
__label__4 we use it for running our home project improvements it is easy to use not as user attractive as some but ok
__label__3 from an old wunderkist fan design and migration is nice thank you please bring back weekly to do widget or at least make possible to select only earlier tasks to show up in widget additionally in widget if due date is passed please show the task in red color thank you
__label__3 went for the premium subscription without a doubt definitely benefitial to those to use it honestly edit everything's good but after changing phones i've suffered having to manually copy the same habit list because the sync function just doesn't work
__label__1 this app is good but the setting is not understandable i might not even give it a single star
__label__2 allowed all the permissions for this app but i still can't get the reminder to work on my smartphone running android 8 downloaded a different reminder app and also allowed all permissions for it and it worked well
__label__5 amazing app helps in staying organised n focused whole day
"__label__5 i have long been an advocate of the stephen covey 7 habits weekly planner 
approach this is the first app i've found that gives me the capability i 
need to do that well i use the projects section to set up my roles and 
goals and then transfer them to my weekly calendar my only wish is that 
the tablet and phone app worked with their desktop app it does not as far 
as i can tell"
__label__2 please fix the widget it doesn't automatically update the day it always shows yesterdays' date constantly having to remove and install widget
__label__3 it is ok but maby it could be a bit more clear
__label__5 хорошее приложение которое реально помогает в жизни нисколько не жалею о покупке платной версии спасибо разработчикам
__label__3 i love it so far but is it usable over multiple devices i am currently using it on my tablet and downloaded the app to my phone but when i try to sign in it says it can't find my email address
__label__3 decent app works like intended but does have bugs for the extra game part of it constantly have to close and reopen the app because the loading bar never really loads or white screens another thing is i dont think we should be paying 3 gems to change our class i accidently chose a class when i upgraded enough and i thought i was fine as the bottom said you can change a class later except it didnt say we needed 3 gems to do it i dont usually get that many gems unless i buy them
__label__1 scheduling reminder intervals does not work
__label__5 good ui and helpful options have recently purchased the pro version for extra functionality
__label__3 3 app
__label__1 my google account didn't sync so i had to delete it and add it anew now everything's gone no backup possible no export i loved the app and would love to have it for iphone as well but not being able to back up any data is pretty annoying i'm super disappointed all my appointments are gone
__label__3 it's very nice i would definitely buy the premium version if it was one time payment but they ask monthly subscription
__label__3 i loved this app but recently since 31st december 2018 the chains are no longer being made even though i'm meeting the criteria for the habit my streaks have been reset at 0 even though my score has stayed at 100 very confusing and annoying any help would be greatly appreciated
__label__4 love it only wish there was more instruction on how it all works it does alot will be perfect once i learn how it's all done
__label__3 seems pretty good but would like to know if there is a way to toggle between 12 24 hour time
__label__3 nice
__label__4 one of the better cleaner to do apps could you please add recurring tasks based on day or date as an example recurring every wednesday take out trash
__label__2 it's been a couple of weeks and still have not been able to share lists keep getting an error that says it's not you it's us already wrote to customer support and have not heard from them
__label__3 i have an issue of widget stretching are there any debugs
__label__2 the interface is incredible it's the perfect organizational app i've always been looking for this is all overshadowed for me however by the fact that it is automatically attached to your email with no way to remove it i would use this app daily if it would just exist in it's own bubble without needing to grab onto 3 emails minor complaint but it really turned me off from the app and if i had known this i would not have used it in the first place
__label__3 the app looks very ok but it lacks help or support portal i have accidently hidden the smart list like the planned how can i unhide them and also how can i assign task to my colleagues or employees
__label__3 the app is great for the most part i just wish that the 'notification option' for tasks would actually alert me no alarm or even a pop up message i got this to help me remember to take care of certain things due to memory issues but it's not gonna be of any help if i can't even remember i have the app please fix the alarm notification system
__label__3 it's very disappointing that real tree planting is a premium service if it was a free option i would use this app almost 7 24 and you would win so much ad money right
__label__3 stopped syncing properly at some point which drives me nuts because having an updated schedule on every device is very important for my job a
__label__4 good a d structured
__label__5 one of the most useful apps on my smartphone
__label__3 kind of confusing to use but it does what is supposed to
__label__3 nice calendar but where is the jewish calendar maybe you could offer more options
__label__3 great until last update love the app its a great tool but since the last update i frequently get server error notifications and the app doesn't function in any capacity can't chat in party dailies and habits don't refresh etc rebooting my phone and reinstalling the app did not solve the issue i'd happily give this a 5 star if this could be fixed and i could get back to my daily log ins and updates
__label__1 purchased by premium getting error can not sync emailed support no response don't waste your time or money
__label__2 i really liked the app for its simplicity that changed tremendously with the recent updates for example it now takes me 10 clicks to postpone a single task people use to do apps to improve their efficiency but this app isn't efficient anymore at all i hope the simplicity comes back with future updates
__label__2 used to be my favorite app changed phones and it doesn't recognize my premium purchase i've been emailing for support for two months with no response so disappointed
__label__3 please provide undo and redo for all actions
__label__2 worst
__label__5 great app very clever design i just hope there will also be a windows version one day
__label__4 hi team i paid for pro version but ended up rebooting my phone now it is asking me to pay again how can i get my pro access again i paid for it on march 16 2020
__label__4 just what i need
__label__3 pomdoro is bad
__label__2 when my phone is in tablet mode android 7 the app will not display in portrait mode it defaults to landscape mode pls fix and i'll change my review
__label__5 super easy and has changed my life in a number of very positive ways excellent tool buy the full version if you are able certainly worth it
__label__1 i have been a subscriber of the pro version for years when this new version came out i tried it and there were problems i tried it again and it seems to work well i tried running with one alarm and now it dosen't stop when i acknowledge it i'm going back to the old version i have removed pro 2 if the problem pesiststs i will have to find a new calendar very frustrated
__label__1 non sense
__label__4 reminder doesn't work as per expectations if we set any task with due date and if get completed before due date and try to mark it completed that task get completed but new task get added with same name and same due date till that due date
__label__3 fun and easy
__label__4 wow they listened they added links between task which was my idea good if only they could be consistent across platforms improve rating to 4 stars just cuz the ticktick team is really trying to be better aldous allow us to see the changes you make in the app
__label__1 costs money to make pixels darker
__label__3 its good the only thing that is missing is the time inclusion like at what time a particular task is planned if that can be added it would be perfect it would be like a personal calendar and activity planner together i hope that can be added
__label__4 life changing app with a great concept but still needs some work
__label__5 this app is great but i am having one issue that is dragging me away to other apps i like less overall my work lunch hour switches every week between 11 00am and 12 00pm i wish there was a way i could have a task repeat every two weeks on weekdays so that i could have these 2 tasks auto rotate weeks is this possible in this app
__label__5 this app is perfect for building habits or even simple reminders its hard to ignore best app ive ever had
__label__3 this app is good however the reason i need a calendar app is to share it with someone else and this app doesn't seem to have a shared calendar function which is a shame because it's a really decent app
__label__1 another simple app with a subscription plan this is not the right strategy to attract more people this kind of app should be a one time payment no more whatever the number of apps with this strategy it doesn't make it a good one
__label__4 it's relatively helpful especially when checking habit progress however some notifications do not come on time but nevertheless i recommend it
__label__3 a good app although disappointed that i can't repeat a reminder without paying
__label__4 the only issue i keep finding is that i get constant errors disconnected from servers even if i have full wifi or full 4g connection it gets clunky with the network connectivity however it has changed my productivity radically in these dark days of my life
__label__1 premium subscription for such a simple app is greedy
__label__5 fantastic app does exactly what i want it to do thank you so much
__label__2 i don't like the new update now trees for 25 min are worth the same as trees for 10 it does not seem fair at all also the trees at the store are now more expensive i don't like the update at all
__label__1 don't receive any notifications alarms
__label__3 it won't allow me to sync it with my android watch and there is nowhere to ask questions
__label__1 i have used this app on my previous android and it offers awesome features however it's not working at all on installing on my new android redmi note 5 i have used this app before and i want this to be working at any cost pls help me to resolve this app does not launch next morning as it should do after i add my tasks it just doesn't launch
__label__5 very easy to use never neglect a bill or task now
__label__4 helpful for my day to day tasks still using free version
__label__2 latest update has not fixes bugs that occur every day frustrating to use sometimes it won't save will just have a loading loop some basic things are not customizable like the calendar starting on monday or the date format doesn't keep track of activity data correctly please focus on getting the app to work instead of focusing on superficial appearance was thinking of paying for a subscription but what's the point if the money will not go towards making the app usable less temperamental
__label__3 download it because i love that it has a weekly monthly and daily goal views also lists and water intake goals but it doesn't have push notifications and it seems like i can't cross off events only goals or tasks and that's a huge deal at least for me so it would be great if you guys can make that happen
__label__2 i transitioned from wonderlist there are a couple of things i don't like when the list is sorted any way then you can not drag the items in the list this makes it very hard to organize long lists also i would like to have the option of adding to the top of the list as well as the bottom otherwise the app is good for what i need it to do
__label__2 this app is a great idea with poor execution reminders only sometimes appear and the ui can be very unresponsive i've checked daily tasks off only to find that the app interpreted this as unchecking the task since it hadn't registered the fact that it is a new day yet which actually subtracts the game resources from you these problems are significant enough to make the rpg like rewards system ineffective for me and the app not worth using as a habit tracker at this time sadly
__label__3 too tricky complicated not immediate maybe isnt what i need i need something more simple
__label__3 the app is great and i ve started to use it rather than wunderlist just 3 stars because i don t think the my day section makes sense tasks flagged as to be done today in others lists should appear in my day as those are the tasks for today seems my day only considers tasks added specifically to that list and that makes it confusing and redundant as in planned the right logic is applied where you see planned tasks for today and ahead shouldn t the same logic apply to the my day window or i am doing something wrong
__label__2 i am a paid user of this app i like this app a lot until android 10 they claim what they used to do is not possible but that is not true because another app i use daylio has a nice notification that jumps out at you like any do used to now any do gives a regular ignorable notification which you click and the app does something on the screen and is pretty pathetic then it gives it's notification to plan your day so it's two clicks with a big visual pause in between not cool
__label__3 after i grow a plant when it gives the option of double reward by watching a video i click on double reward and it shows a video which i watch also after that the screen goes black nothing happens and i had to close it when i try to open again it says forest app is not responding and when i click ok for that and open the app it opens but with only half reward there is no double reward given even after i watch the advertisement video what kind of cheating is this please fix it
__label__2 i downloaded it but don't know how to use it really messed up app
__label__5 this app has helped me greatly in getting organized and managing my life i like that it intergrates with my calendar and email great productivity and goal app
__label__5 this app turned everything into a game it really helped me to focus on tasks and be more organized productive
__label__4 what gives you as much flexibility as you need projects to grope tasks lables powerful filters alow you to create you personal views but it is possible to syncronize only one google calendar which is funny as for editor's choice app it is not possible to grope labels to set common color or search pattern it is not possible to label a project so that all tasks created in a project get this label i hole guys will fix the issue with calender otherwise all props do not worth it
__label__5 i really like this app even when you are retired one needs some order to keep balance in one life i have learned to appreciate its benefits tasks the little things we seem to forget every day shopping lists reminders and the themes that makes it fun
__label__5 motiva a mejorar es brutal está aplicación
__label__1 this app is bur futti randi chodari
__label__3 the only problem i have is that a lot of content in the app including the information and payment gateway regarding premium version is not in english if i can't understand the terms and conditions or whatever i am clicking how will get the correct information about the purchase kindly provide all information regarding pro version in complete english 'only'
__label__1 i wish i could keep using wunderlist disappointed with this app but it has gotten better
__label__5 marvellous makes a game out of everyday life helps you organise your tasks while feeding stats about the progress you consider important and the gold xp reward punishment system gives some type of extra motive brilliant i say
__label__3 good app easy to use but the reminders don't work no matter what the app says i should do please do fix that
__label__3 good app however the notification has stopped working
__label__3 i am setting daily targets it means when i open the app i should able to see it as a list weekly target monthly targets yearly targets are to be alrady suppose to be designed my work is assingining task i suppose wishing to add for daily or weekly or monthly or yearly targets
__label__4 it is exelent sometimes a little buggy when deleting some tasks that are daily
__label__5 its ok but we can not undestad repeated task shedule
__label__4 for some reason i can't edit my other review on the phone or if i can it's not clear how lists are not in an intuitive place imo so i missed them entirely resulting in that erroneous post if this supported arbitrarily nested task levels i'd give it five stars but i'm definitely going to use this r i p wunderlist
__label__2 great app but deleted it because i don't like the new santa hat icon edit added a star because they replied and reverted the icon
__label__3 stephen can 2 people share a task list on their respective phones
__label__5 honestly great for helping me focus while working from home i use it to stop myself from binging news and to manage time using pomodoro method
__label__4 very nice ui but need some work 1 first week day monday sunday option in calendar 2 calendar should show tasks habits below calendar instead of when touching the selected day only this makes you feel you have nothing the whole day mont add this and app will be more solid and i may jump into premium keep it up
__label__4 good simple app that works well it keeps my to do list synced between my android phone and web browser on my computer
__label__2 simple app widget is bad left side has a bar that ruins symmetry also you cant remove the new task button also why can i change list color but cant change button color would also be cool to preview what compact cozy and whatnot settings do instead of having to select them one by one leave settings and go back in to change them again all in all its almost a 5 star app but the nuissances ruin the experience a bit
__label__2 can't sync i paid to have the ability to make more tasks but that's about all it's good for
__label__5 best to do list app so far i like it
__label__2 it is doing a strange black screen thing and randomly opens by itself other reviews have mentioned this and i suspect it is making my phone crash my phone is crashing several times a day when i remove the app it stops crashing i hope there is a fix for this it works just fine on my tablet but not my phone it's a great app due to its simplicity i switched to another planner app today and will be requesting a refund
__label__5 personally i absolutely love this app and it is exactly mathematically what i have been looking for the only true inconvenience is that once the day is over you cannot go back and add tasks to a day developers could you pretty pretty pretty please with sugar on top make it possible for us to go back and add tasks that we have completed on previous days maybe in the calendar area or something thank you kindly revision 5 star thank you for responding and teaching me hot to edit task
__label__4 this app is good and it's useful yes it's true that it has a few bugs here and there but the app itself is good and i like it i wish it had an offline mode because i can't stay on all the time but i can see why we need to be online at all times
__label__3 good as it is simple and effective it could be more enhanced
__label__1 annoyed paid for this years ago paid full version and used it and recommended it now i am asked to pay yearly to remove ads what joke i paid for full add free version already and there is nothing new to justify the yearly purchase
__label__3 it is a cosy and user friendly to do app
__label__3 after recently updation this app is not proper working please solve this issue
__label__5 after i found out wunderlist was going away i look for an app that could do all the things that could do as it was pretty much perfect for me todoist is pretty much as good not perfect but for free i can't complain
__label__3 easy to use intuitive has issues to share the kist woth somebidy if one of the use is using a school or work account non collaborative
__label__2 i dont like how it charged me automatically after the free trial without informing me expiry of trial or if i wanted to subscribe to the paid service
__label__3 as i am a regular user of this app this app needs some update like the calendar based listing method people will go to date and list the task another problem is so many color for list it's annoying who don't like colors they can select one color for every task list that is all
__label__3 ребят конечно круто что вы сделали это в виде игры только вот вы бы могли доработать такие вещи сбивается сортировка задач после выхода из приложения я хочу чтобы у меня постоянно была сортировка по не выполненим ежедневным задачам я закрыла прогу на вкладке ежедневные задачи хочу чтобы при повторном открытии она была также на этой вкладке
__label__2 not free
__label__4 i have been using this premium version of app from past 6 months and its really great but i still believe there are few feature still missing in it to make things easy like there should be dashboard which gives details of all habbits progress in bar percentage marked successful currently you have to go to each habbit and check the status so a centralized section giving more details on the progress would be helpful like it is in habbit tracker app also a dynamic habbit counter could be added
__label__3 this app is ok the thing that makes it stand out for me is that i've been able to set it up to work with google home as my grocery and to do list however since the update i now can't click into the full app from the widget which is necessary as i'm unable to rearrange my tasks from the widget and i can't seem to find a way so that the app automatically sorts my tasks by 'priority' i can only see how to do it afterwards
__label__4 good
__label__4 seems like a very good idea but how can i edit what i've done the previous day eg if its tuesday it seems to be impossible to edit achievements from monday which seems like a perfect thing do to on tuesday morning
__label__2 first i liked the free version but after a while it got annoying with all the advertisements
__label__2 decent but a pain in bums to have an alarm go out every morning at 9 00 am just to remind you to plan your day is out right stupid i'm not mental pigmy i can do things for myself
__label__4 very useful but a feature to postpone events more easily would be nice
__label__3 i've been using this happily for years but i have realised that it desperately needs ical feeds functionality to make it perfect i need to see personal and work calendars and an university provided ical feed all in the same place
__label__3 i've been using bc1 for years and i've installed bc2 on at least 2 seperate occasions bc2 is so not as good as bc1 the overall look makes it look like a cheap childs game the functionality became nonsensical and it made going back to bc1 such a pleasure i can't imagine what the developers were thinking when making such changes after using bc1 for so long i had high hopes for its future development but alas it not to be these days i'm looking elsewhere
__label__1 reminders are premium it defeats the main purpose of the app
__label__5 great makes you organise your life
__label__5 the app has a clean sharp interface and is easy to use i appreciate having one app for my daily todo's and calendar needs it also never unexpectedly quits on me
__label__3 useful app
__label__3 force closes when trying to create challenge
__label__4 it's a really great app
__label__3 very good app but something lacl there is options default task set today tommorow etc one more problem when we add task in any list it automatically saved in other other when we add task any date it demand time necessary it shoud be optinal
__label__5 it has everything i need seemless synchronization across devices habit tracker dark theme calendar and a whole lot more i'm usually not a fan of paying monthly for a to do app but this one is so well made i don't mind paying 2 99 monthly at all hoping to see some more themes in the future
__label__3 it's an okay app but i have found better ones such as i am sober this needs to be paid for to be useful
__label__1 asking to buy pro version when clicked on new program
"__label__3 it would help me a lot if it could silence the notification from other apps 
when i'm studying"
__label__5 awesome
__label__3 the aap good but not some updates are required such as in notes section add photo upload option add journal option
__label__5 so far i love it you can turn your life into a game and reward yourself for everyday tasks no life coach can do a better job you earn gold and xp for daily chores awesome and so far no issues
__label__1 this is just a re skinned samsung calendar don't waste your time
__label__3 i prefer the simplicity and organization of the old wunderlist app over this new microsoft app
__label__2 idk how it works
__label__4 very good calendar
__label__4 events sometimes take a while to show up on the day you selected for them other times a certain day will not be selectable choosing midnight as an ending time for an event doesn't seem to work
__label__3 wish the reminder have had a repeat function e g every week so i don't have to recheck the tasks
__label__3 the new notifications in 5 3 suck they visually look wrong don't perform well and are a huge step backwards would love to see a reversion to the system notifications rather than custom
__label__3 this app cannot be useful to me until it works with dav synchronized task lists for some reason it is able to load calendars from the davx app but not tasks
__label__1 this app kept losing my reminders
__label__3 i can no longer touch the widget to open the full app what happened i use to be able to touch the upper left hand corner of the widget and the list would open in full screen
"__label__3 it talks about habit building but in effect it doesn't help much apart 
from giving very subtle reminders of tasks which to me were fairly easy 
to ignore it doesn't really push oneself to break free of lethargy or 
other excuses which we usually end up giving for not keeping a habit apart 
from few motivational text snippets i would like to request you that as 
this app is named habitbull you need to please make it act like a bull it 
should lead and at times force the users to do the right thing a little 
more aggressive approach to habit building is what could really help"
__label__3 still trying to get used to the app
__label__1 worst apk reminder not work
__label__5 awesome to do list makes things like grocerie lists very simple the way list can be compiled as a page of single swipeable tabs
__label__1 i love it at first plus the very idea gamifying a task to make it a habit it was all fun until the 'i cant use it offline' that really threw me off please make it available offline as well
__label__3 it's super
__label__1 quite ordinary experience
__label__1 who puts ads on a calendar y'all that desperate for money smh
__label__5 здравствуйте ваше приложение мне очень помагает в работе и рутине очень обширная программа с множеством функций у меня предложение как вам идея добавлять собственные иконки к задачам как например к аватарке героя мне кажется что среди всех иконок может и не быть нужной иконки же дадут возможность максимального представления о задаче к примеру я занимаюсь пайкой и покупаю различные модели паяльников радиодеталей хотелось бы добавить изображение конкретного елемента будет круто
__label__3 is this offline or can you use this even though your not connected to the internet
__label__3 good premise just doesn't sync with any calendars unhelpful guide
__label__4 it is a fantastic apps but if they can allow the push reminder in the free version it will make it perfect
__label__4 this app is damn near perfect but you know what would be awesome being able to check off each complete tasks by adding a check mark i would even pay for that feature make my life a lot easier
__label__3 i would love to buy trees but even though i have the coins i get told i don't have enough that is rather frustrating but it is great to set goals and make it so you can not be distracted by texts and emails
__label__5 need to organise my tasks so far so good
__label__3 i love it but my daily tasks dont reset at midnight so i cant use it in the morning im in western canada what timezones should i set this to so it works for me irs just frustrating not being able to use it for the majority of my day
__label__3 average save your money re subscriptions wasn't what i thought it was paid for the yearly but hardly ever use it there are enough apps on my samsung galaxy note to fulfil the needs of this app
__label__2 this is terribly buggy and you're better off avoiding it use the website instead if you're on your mobile device latest update doesn't update habit counters on screen after you press any buttons all of the command is processed though app still doesn't display items that are found just another buggy update
__label__2 came over from wunderlist its good that you guys have synced my lists here however i have many shared to do lists with comments i don't see any comment feature in msft to do when can this feature be expected will increase rating once this feature is introduced
__label__2 cool idea but it keeps crashing when you try to add subtasks
__label__1 this is demo only
__label__4 i downloaded this game in the hope's that the format would help me with my procrastination and can i just say its exceeded my expectations it's so good i ended up having to change some of the pre set tasks and rewards to make it more personalized but apart from that it's great highly recommend if you like me like to procrastinate and make excuses to avoid tasks
__label__4 needs an easier way to switch from other task apps specifically common ones such as google tasks please add the functionality to import tasks lists reminders and events by logging in with a google account
__label__2 it would be a very helpful app if it actually worked the way you'd expect if i say i want a task to be weekly but make it so i can complete that task any day what i'm trying to do is make the task flexible so i can do the weekly task whatever day of the week i feel like instead however making it available everyday turns it into a daily task which i will be punished for by not completing daily my only real solution at the moment is filling up my to do list which is really frustrating
__label__2 i was told to install planner pro instead of planner plus which was what i already used in order for my cell phone ipad to sync i have had at least 5 emails back forth with the contact person but i still can't get my calendars linked using my email address as instructed i guess i will have to go back to my google calendar i love the planner plus but need a calendar that syncs to both my cell and ipad
__label__4 i find it's useful and easy to check
__label__4 i enjoyed using habitbull in the past and decided to give it another go not a lot has changed i do like the app very simple to use and gives great reminders
__label__4 your app is awesome please add sticky notification
__label__4 great way to manage your tasks only downside is you set the deadlines and can knowingly chance them at any time
__label__3 the app is very good but after the change in scheduling settings the feature is not convenient at all each time i need to schedule the task to a certain time it's a torture
__label__4 it's very versatile the project system makes it easy to group tasks together the one problem is that it doesn't have a calendar view
__label__4 i am using pro version and its pretty well organised applicatiom among its competitors but my suggestion is that please make a significant difference in tree for varioua time period for example most of tree looks same at evry time period
__label__3 not bad
__label__2 after paying for the pro version it went all good for a few days and now it doesn't even open it says forest keeps stoping i tried clearing the cache but nothing
__label__5 the best to do app ever now i don't forget any important things on my mind i can write or record at anytime or anywhere thanks ms
__label__3 i believe that u should introduce a better interface to explain its working and an optoon to create day plans accaording to ur schedule and not with a calender i mean a time planner ao that i can plan my time accordingly by a pie chart
__label__3 huge like from the bottom of my heart
__label__1 not working in my phone
__label__4 i really like the app i'm having an issue though where the widget doesn't populate when a new day starts i have to delete it and readd it or restart my phone
__label__5 vb
__label__4 have been looking for a way to incorporate the elements of gaming into making progress in real life even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic really like it and it has made a big difference the only reason i took it down a star is because it depletes my phone battery really fast if i am in the app for very long such as when i am shopping or browsing challenges so i do these things mostly on my pc overall great job would recommend this to anyone that enjoys gaming but is struggling with motivation in the real world
__label__4 good app easy to use i like the fact that it emails my daily to do list
__label__4 this app is very helpful however i had bought this app on my apple device and just recently swapped to android and now if i want the full version of this app i have to re purchase it to get all the facilities
__label__5 good please make a note taking app also you make amazing apps
__label__3 this is a good app but the list i shared with my friend did not sync when i completed some of the task i click complete but my friend still view it as not complete
__label__2 just one neccessary thing just one thing and it is missing to see only your today and earlier incomplete tasks in the widget automatically every day with different due date colors depending on if it is a today task or earlier
__label__1 update 11 02 20 use at your own risk as expected no contact from developers app has not been updated since 2018 this app was great for a month until it kept freezing my phone a de reinstall has now lost all my data and looking at other users with this issue it looks like it is lost forever because of the sync function never working and no contact from developers very upset and disappointed
__label__1 got banned for talking about not politically correct stuff in a respectful manner didnt even had a chance to discuss or clear my name would not recommend bc of it being heavily monitored and censored it does not facilitate what it was aiming for a community for learning and growth after pouring 2 months and money into it was terribly disappointed after my ban yes perma ban no warnings no nothing disgusting outsourcing will power is a bad idea anyways
__label__5 i got this app to write my schedule on it it works great my children liked it too
__label__5 great app
__label__3 there could be any difference between gold that we earn if my rewards are cheat meal and netflix episode and tasks are run 10 km and read a book it shouldn't be able to get a cheat meal reward for reading a book
__label__1 need more habit columns for free
__label__4 the app's a bit glitch y not gonna lie but it helps tremendously in my day to day life the community aspect of it is amazing i actually feel motivated by all the kind words good job developers my life's a bit less bleak now c
__label__3 please allow more than five habits in free version
__label__5 excellent app
__label__5 wonderful app
__label__1 cant access calendar allow access to calendar crashes waiti or close app
__label__5 great
__label__1 kept bugging out trying to register log in
__label__2 yeah keep everything for premium and then say its free
__label__4 good
__label__4 have been using the old pro version on all my previous devices for years and liked it very much just started to use this new one not long ago it has a more contemporary design simplified and streamlined options but the change in drag n drop in weekly view costs it a star
__label__3 a little shy on functionality but for the price it can't be beat i use it daily
__label__5 so far it's everything i need was looking for
__label__3 been a user of the app for 5 years has been helpful in managing a busy life up until recently would have given 5 stars three stars because of poor app support i think i have finally worked out my issue but disappointed in level and responsiveness of support just hope you never need support
__label__4 great app my only problem is some of my habits i created doesn't work i set a habit so i don't do something atleast 8 days of the month but it links all the days inbetween successful days together i only end up being successful for 6 days out of the month but then it says 20 days successful because it link all the successful days together going to try other apps unless i can resolve this issue
__label__2 it's supposed to be able to go on multiple devices yet when i downloaded to my phone after putting it on my tablet it just keeps saying loading after i spent a lot of time setting it up and plugging in all my appointments for the next month it's a huge disapointment should i get fixed i will change rating to a 5 star
__label__4 great experience
__label__4 i like that they have incorporated a lot of different plants to choose from
__label__3 ok but feels like untested alpha state software tricky to navigate quickly when called from a widget direct call entry for phone calls seems to be missing though that's the first thing one needs in a todo list sorting tasks is either impossible or a well hidden feature sharing and assigning is very rudimentary
__label__3 need to explore more
__label__5 it is very very easy use and after spending hours longing a to do list app i can say this is the best app i have ever used download it and install it i promise you will not regret it
__label__3 at times it doesn't work as expected hut the app can be great potential if scrutinized aptly
__label__2 doesn't let you say you did something yesterday which is for me a big deal as i browsed the options looking for a way to do that almost everything was only a premium option
__label__4 the idea is good but the app can be made better with some performance optimisation for example when i launch the app it takes at least 3 seconds to synchronize and restart my habit list with the correct status and all pop ups only appear with a 2sec delay overall i like the idea by i'm moving onto other habit tracker apps because this kind of gamification isn't for me appreciate the app
__label__3 great app so long as you only use the free version which only tracks 5 x habits used the free version for a couple of weeks then paid 9 49 for the platinum version so i could sync to other devices really disappointed that the sync option won't work and software support is non existent for an expensive app i would expect the developers to be as helpful as possible when a customer has an issue but they have completely ignored my request for help
__label__4 it is what i have looked for for some time i wish it could sync'd across multiple devices
__label__3 no signup option
__label__3 new to the app so still learning
__label__5 i'm really happy with this app it helps me stay productive both in school and with my writing goals and even tiny things like just getting out of bed in the morning i 100 recommend this to anyone who procrastinates as much as i do because it's really helping me get out the hole i dug myself into with my bad habits
__label__3 can add a reminder option withthe specified time
__label__3 good integration with other calanders but not easy to read at a glance
__label__3 useful
__label__2 reminder notification not on time for about an hour so it is inconvenient
__label__3 can only have 5 unless you pay for premium
__label__1 this app would not let me start a new day it listed my tasks that i performed for one day as overdue for the next day just weird
__label__5 it's an amazing app it allows you to control all the details it helped me a lot
__label__2 i regret buying this app tl dr don't use this app if you ever intend on changing routines or planning changing existing routines is very hard as it simply deletes whatever overlaps in time so unnecessary and impossible to revert if you accidentally click pm instead of am once your whole day is deleted permanently also every time i want to sync between my phone and my tablet i have to export it to google drive and then import it from the other device also you can't copy items or days to another time please make this app more user friendly
__label__3 i love habitica and i like the ui of the updated app but i find it frustrating that the app doesn't show all the content that the website does normally this is just a small annoyance but now after paying for a group plan for my family i'm discovering that my kids can't access the group tasks list via the app which makes the entire thing a waste of money since the whole point was to be able to create tasks for family chores please tell me a fix is in the works
__label__1 predatory ads killing it
__label__2 when u want to add check list this will help you out instead of writing some where u can add them out here but in the case u want to develop it as a habit then u have to changes the setting and activate habits mode even in that u can create only 5 habits if u want to create more than 5 habits u will be asked to update to premium version only 5 habits thats funny if its atleast 10 then okay
__label__5 helpful to visualize recurring events on google calendar
__label__3 good but still does not handle repeat events such as daylight savings time change i e setting a reminder for the second sunday of march each year to change clocks that don't adjust automatically does not handle last day of the month reminders well also the list should display an icon by repeating tasks backup options are very limited does not handle integration with e g dropbox otherwise it would be perfect for my needs
__label__5 really amazing it helps people achieve your tasks better than using a piece of paper inclusive you can fix commitments in future days
__label__1 even after several updates the problem persists despite adding and sceduling tasks the calender inside the app isnt showing any tasks at all no tasks visible at all in the in app calendar view in the calendar widget however i can see tasks arranged datewise honestly yours is a really nice app with features but what's the point to having them if they don't work in the first place
"__label__3 this is a really good app it's what i'm looking for but i wish it was 
available offline so that i could add edit my tasks to dos habits and 
rewards"
__label__5 hi i've been using this app for a week and i can see how easy it made it for me to get used to my daily routines pluse it has a great user experience and interface design
__label__5 really great it takes some time to get it working my current use is to input what i plan to do the previous day either at night or through the day when i discover what needs to be done jotting down your plans is more effective than you might think to productivity ill keep using it and get back when i discover more tips to be more productive
__label__3 no of activities that we can add is only 5 that's why i give this 3
__label__1 i like when this developers claim their apps are free wait 95 free you mean 5 free if even data costs money stop pretending this crappy apps are free for an note app this one is nothing but invasive
__label__4 very good have been using it daily for work however i really dislike that i cannot change the date for one of many recurring events it changes the whole lot
__label__3 idk if its my phone android but i dont receive push notifications nor reminder for this app
__label__3 this app is missing subtasks and obviously no prioritizing subtasks when subtasks are added if they ever are please make with all the primary task options and a next action option
__label__3 reminder is not working what i should do
__label__4 new item menu for actions is horrible please bring the old one back delete action has a bad offset and is rendered behind the navigation bar it's so inconvenient
__label__5 honestly it's not a bad app at all
__label__2 the new widget is not looking good please bring back the old widget or atleast bring an option to make it look like the older version
__label__5 very nice
__label__4 good design hope the plant real trees is a true story
__label__3 the day pro widget view shows events overlapping despite them not scheduled at the same time it's an annoyance but an overall decent app
__label__3 loved the concept beautiful design and has taken its place on my home screen after a clarification from the dev on syncing other calendars i also love the fact that you can just jump in and use the widget or you can opt for deep customisation of the look feel and functionality
__label__2 getting annoying reminder keep jumping out although the task is set one month later start looking for alternatives
__label__3 wants me to write a username but says username already taken even when i put nonsense in
__label__3 ugh too complicated just want plain priority list uninstalling
__label__3 bull i've been using it for 2 weeks and it's okay except for the fact that the widget doesn't work most of the time i have to open the app directly to be able to list activities which renders the widget useless i paid for the upgrade which makes this issue all the more frustrating
__label__1 i can't share my lists with my partner because i'm told i'm using a work or school account but i'm not no such problem on wunderlist
__label__3 right now i m using todoist for simple tasks as an inbox for research and non essential stuff but todoist needs to step up their game i don't use todoist for long term planning i use my other task manager for that or for important tasks or projects because todoist simply is not built for actual projects although it refers to its lists as projects what todoist and many users actually are wanting from todoist is a task outliner close to mylifeorganized notion dynalist where projects exist within the task outline had to give it a three star meh rating
__label__1 came back to see if i can use the app since i do like it it's a great idea i'm my case i need to be able to add calendar events reminders in one app 100 essential and afaik this isn't supported i have a shared gcal a personal and another work one and all of them needs to not only show up for me to organize life itself they also need to be managed in the app i use for reminders etc for this to do what it needs for me not just reminders calendar events needs add edit back to any do
__label__2 not that good after using
__label__5 if you like checking boxes off this is a great app you can create lists sublists and even nest tasks inside of a list it's a great organizational list app
__label__3 i'd mark it higher if the reminder alarm could tell the time the alerts pop up a good 15 45 minutes late
__label__3 so so i expected the ability to attach files to notes and a lot more flexibility with format
__label__3 so as huge fan of wunderlist i was devastated to hear that it was going to cease along comes to do so most of it works similar to wunderlist which is good but there's little things i just don't like for example when tapping on a list boxes are too big and in your face text too big also main screen is ok when ticking something off on a list how about something to divide to do and done from that list instead of everything together give us more customisation options for sizes colours etc
__label__3 i love how the app is almost exactly like the last one the only irritating thing is that the show completed button is no longer at the bottom of the list this button was used so much due to my fingers accidentally completing a task i would just hit the 'show completed' button and my most recent item would be at the top ready to re add to my list now we need to go through a few buttons to find it and it doesn't bring up the most recently deleted item very irritating
__label__4 good app i agree with other reviews the addition of tasks will make it great update the new edition seems to be less useful it seems one need the pro version to get it to work well
__label__1 the app is broken right now downloaded today to try it out and the first two slides were blank character creation is all blank unfortunately deleted but was looking forward to trying this has been catalogued by others when its fixed i'll try again but so far it seems that this app is only really properly supported for iphone users i have a samsung s9
"__label__2 play voice option does not work consistently it regularly does not sound 
the vocal reminder this is a function i rely on how do i contact you to 
discuss further"
__label__5 this is a fantastic app with a fantastic community love this game helped me start sleeping on time and drink water anything that you can imagine for yourself it can help you do
__label__2 i liked it but most of intresting features was unable until you purchase them
__label__4 since the may 1st update it made me create my character 15 times before i uninstalled and reinstalled before having to do it again and spending close to 45 minutes deleting pre generated habits dailies and to dos to get to my original ones terrible i love the app otherwise update since the new update it is fixed
__label__4 i've really enjoyed this visual approach this is the first time i've used a digital schedule of anytype and been successful i bullet journal and use a planner
__label__2 just started using it but so far so good
__label__3 where is the priority setting my app interface doesn't match the video you created for new users i liked everywhere and can't find any any to prioritize tasks only set a time for a reminder please provide up to date instruction for setting priorities and other details for using the app thanks
__label__1 bad ui bad quick short cuts
"__label__2 was excited for this app but the fact i can't change the notification 
alarm is a deal breaker"
__label__2 the free version comes with ads and normally i would be okay with that except that it decides to interrupt you seemingly every minute to buy the full version now when planning your day you might have to schedule time to exit out of the constant ad pop ups
__label__5 simple to use and surprisingly motivational graphics are cute and though i don't use the music due to hearing loss there's a good selection love the tracking feature enabling you to see your focus time for the day week month etc
__label__5 hi seems a good app to me for india this will cost 200 is it yearly cost or for lifetime please let me know
__label__3 a great app has some kinks that need ironing and i'll update when they're done but i love this app and use it daily as intended
__label__3 it really helps in focusing but there is this premium thing so i cannot do many stuff i think you have to pay or get the premium thing to plant trees in real life but i like how there's this different kind of trees and stuff like it has music
__label__3 seems pretty good but totally crippled the free version by not allowing reminder notifications what's the point without those not bothering with it
__label__1 ads with free apps are acceptable but fullscreen non skippable ads blocking the entire screen for 20 seconds are not awful user experience google has recently removed 600 android apps from play store because of disruptive fullscreen ads this app may be the next one to be removed not recommended
__label__4 easy to use i will however like to have a time boxing feature for my daily activities
__label__5 pretty good great graphics as well
__label__1 reminders are not showing notifications for the past 1 week to me sir
__label__4 homescreen widget would be nice with more display option such as the progress bar etc
__label__2 where my reply ended up i cant see but i am a user for 2 5 years and this app never worked properly for me i use for the script task adding feature and pay for supporting its development but they are not much interested i guess businessline halit try searching your emails i wrote more details in original post
__label__4 i wish i could create notes without having to select a date otherwise so far so nice
__label__5 nice looking clear presentation of the calendar
__label__2 does not sync if i enter an item in the agenda it does not sync with the widget sometimes it takes a whole day before it is visable in the widget in the widget only 2 items are visable the rest keep saying loading for days now even if i manually sync
__label__5 i really like so far i makes my daily routine a bit fun and make it meant something in a way
__label__3 pretty good app but nothing crazy that i can't achieve with google calendars already if there is i'm not in need for the feature atm i've really been looking for the feature to set a reoccurring remind with a full custom option for say repeat every 43 days or repeat 3 months then 4 months then 3 then 4 etc this sorts of features would be amazingly handy as you would then not have to set up a new reminder for each date after having worked them out manually if you add this feature please lmk
__label__3 best habit tracker edit can you guys fix the overall habitbull score graph it's not accurate always trending down no matter what
__label__2 hello habitbull team i need to check all features in premium version so can you give me access to premium version for 2 days so that i can try all features and check if the feature that i need is present or not and then buy premium version
__label__4 would have given it 5 stars but it doesn't seem to want to rotate when using my tablet
__label__2 great at first but now it's getting on my nerves i tried to create a routine for each day of the week today is monday and for some reason my monday routine shows up for tomorrow wednesday thursday and friday i've had daily routines show up on other days over the past week as well there seems to be a setting where i can change this but that doesn't seem to do the trick it shouldn't be this hard to have one daily routine for each day of the week uninstalled
__label__1 an awesome app best in field but expensive at 30 subscription for every single year that you want to use the premium feature and yet zero way to contact developers for support other than a fairly useless help guide that has every question under the sun except the one that you need answered i would expect much more from an app that cost 30 each and every year very poor and a pity because its fundamentally a great app
__label__3 you should have the choice to swipe left and right for different months and just up and down also change the word title event colors on a particular day to make it stand out
__label__5 love it only tweak i'd love to see is when you have something to reschedule and you open the smart rescheduler feature when you click on the item you can customize the suggested date
__label__5 good organizer
__label__3 facebook login not working
__label__1 worst app waste of time
__label__5 great app good reports and tracking ui is simple and does what it needs to do keeps it productive
"__label__2 u should work on the phones like oppo and others so that customer don't 
find problem"
__label__3 limited functionality but reliable
__label__3 todoist is the best i've found for allowing me to create to do lists and then assign tasks dates and times later while syncing with google calendar unfortunately it has a bad habit of deleting past calandar entries especially those that repeat don't ever modify one instance of a recurring event
__label__5 it's very good it helps me more about my difficulties in habits tracking i found it best of all
__label__1 no notification or stick to notification n alert n all features not working after a day in my previous review you replied to try that feature i already did that my android version is 9 asus zenfone max pro m1 plz fix this error
__label__4 overall good app interface is easy to use effective and powerful would be good if it had better integration with calendars and other services while many features are free premium is a continuous subscription and quickly adds up to be very expensive
__label__2 i was testing this to replace fabulous so far the notifications are not persistent enough fabulous is able to wake me up in the morning
__label__5 great app to keep your timing steady
__label__3 for real who asked for markdown especially that check mark in markdown is so tiny and stupid the highlight is also not nice if we want to take notes we use evernote not ticktick
__label__5 i was mortified when i heard wunderlist was going to be withdrawn i downloaded this as suggested and i am pleased with it it is much the same with a few little extras easy to use and well organised without a lot of extra clutter that other apps give you i have decided to use this app immediately instead of waiting until wunderlist ends
__label__2 not a fan of the new foundations update you promised so many new features and didn't deliver any of them the update to subtasks didn't fix some of the core issues with them
__label__2 interesting idea but useless
__label__2 i changed the settings like it asked allowed the permissions to let it stop me from coming off the app but it doesn't work allowed me to go on a different app then when going back on the tree was still alive
__label__5 so far this app does everything i need it to do it helps me to keep track of all of the tasks i want to accomplish and helps me make positive steps towards changing bad habits
__label__4 liked wunderlist better can't add more than one share i wanted family grocery list
__label__3 its ok bought it sadly need another payment to customise palette sad hope more update come
__label__1 i just bought pro on my tablet 15 minutes ago and then installed sectograph on my phone and it says i have to buy pro again what the heck happened with syncing google accounts
__label__3 the app is great but after using awhile it start to lag
__label__3 good app but only counts by day 5 stars if there was an option to count times a week as well
__label__4 easy to use
__label__3 its a very good game and i like it but to buy most things in the game you have to get gems or a subscription which you both to pay for also i don't seem to get anything when i purchase the enchanted armoire
__label__1 only 9 lists allowed for the free edition incredibly expensive by app standards for the pro 37 per year i don't mind supporting a good product but that is ridiculous for a shopping and task list app
__label__5 this is a very useful app helps me a lot with my day to day task management
__label__3 how can anydo send reminders to someone on whatsapp when the task is due i want the person to whom task is assigned shud also get a reminder before it's due how can i do this
__label__4 easy to navigate with simple task input and completion of task sense of accomplishment i like it so far
__label__1 don't use this unless you sync your tasks the backup and restore functionality from one device to the next is bad
__label__4 learning hopeful
__label__5 great app for revising and studying it really helps you to stay focused growing trees to keep you focused is a lovely concept and i love the sounds you can play in the background
__label__4 love this app it makes viewing all my google calendars in one apot easy my only issue is entering locations because i live in a rural area and it recommends places in large cities all the time
__label__3 sorry i dont get it i have no idea why seeing my schedule on a circle is somehow better than a rectangle what am i missing
__label__3 not fully developed this app could be great but in their rush to put it out the features are highly lacking no push notifications you cannot upload stickers no widget pretty buggy i really liked the idea of it but it needs improvement i will update to 5 stars if and when these features are added they did reach out to me to resolve my issues so i am updating to three stars
__label__4 almost perfect a feature i'd love is if using share could predict the project you're adding to based on the app you're sharing from when i share from spotify youtube or soundcloud it always goes to my music project i wish after doing that a dozen times todoist would know that i like to add these links to my music protect and preselect it for me
__label__5 this app is a great help for me this helps me enjoy productivity in whole new level i have been struggling for years to get my life back together but with this app i feel like i can finally get some work done in a fun and enjoyable way thank you very much
__label__2 the app itself is really nice i like how the widget displays my schedule for the day it gives me a very nice grasp of my time the bad thing is that it slows down my smartphone i have a s9 and it drains a lot of battery it makes my phone lag and stutter when i try to open it i uninstalled ans reinstalled apps to check my theories so i uninstalled this one the phone was doing so much better and i even paid for the pro version
"__label__3 there is one problem that not notified me accurate time it's 5 to 10 
minutes after wake me up why i don't know please help me regarding this"
__label__1 cannot get it to work on my huawei p20 i have tried 3 times and cannot get it to sign in it looks like it works fine on my ipad because i can sign up and get in but on my phone i am unable to do either i needed something that i could use on both devices but am unable to get into in ob my phone
__label__3 ui is hard to understand
__label__2 i really liked the app but suddenly from nowhere all of my data were gone one second they were fine then when i connect to the internet it's back at lvl 0 with the johnny avatar it seemed that there was no way to get my data back dropbox saved data seemed to have been overwritten so idk what to do i feel betrayed being immersed in the apo then suddenly left hanging with the fact that i don't even know what caused it
__label__2 update i know it's a one time fee as stated that i had already paid same acct now i don't have pro i've had it for a while now and had purchased the pro version right away my reason for giving 2 star now is all of a sudden it tells me i do t have the pro feature anymore that is supposed to be a 1 time payment also if there was a desktop version that would be majorly useful disappointed that i would have to pay for pro again if i wanted to continue those features
__label__5 practical apps i use this everyday
__label__1 not only is the app bad the second they have your email address they start spamming you response hey doist i have a better idea quit taking people's email information and spamming them without their permission
__label__4 nāo é exatamente oque estou procurando
__label__3 just migrated to tick tick it's better with more holistic useful functionality and cheaper with free version having not that much restrictions like in todoist sorry guys it seems you have some work to do if you want to stay competitive
__label__5 this is by far the most useful and customisable gamify your life app it also focuses on skills and character building which is my favorite part and mostly missing with comparable apps takes a bit to get into it but it's definitely worth it d
__label__1 was forced to migrate from wunderlist my husband and i both used wunderlist extensively sharing and updating lists when we were force to migrate over it migrated everything except the lists were not shared anymore so when i updated my list it does not update his list i reshaped that list and it created a duplicate list for him this is extremely annoying because we have to reshare everything
__label__3 it does the job i wanted that is to ring alarm at the set time however i am unable to clear the timeline that is old ones couldn't get much help from their help center
__label__1 can't rely for reminders no alarm comes even if i select alarm because of relying on this app i missed an important task
__label__3 with the latest update it seems that when i update the frequency for one task it messes up the frequency and repeat days of the week for another task which is annoying as i was using the app to track my weekly tasks
__label__1 don't bother downloading because even whitelisting requires payment and its all separated payment so this app just want to grab money trash
__label__4 nice app
"__label__3 i really do like this but there's one probably petty reason i have given 
it a three my class i cannot seem to change from warrior to something 
else this is a problem to me because i personally hate the warrior class 
in games this makes me less motivated to stop my warrior from losing 
health and the such i would be much more motivated to help my healer"
__label__3 pretty good app
__label__4 easy to quickly find and use
__label__2 i have used this awesome app for 3 years at least sleek convenient powerful but the recent updates just bring more and very intrusive ads if that is not reverted soon i will have to change app pissed by how awesome app become awful because someone wants to make money out of other's great job and thanks for your copy pasted answer
__label__3 overall alot of features can make the app more organise using colors cannot find way to export when switching phone
__label__5 i have used several habit tracking apps and this one is the best it is easy to use and i like the way it gives my percentage success rate and my streaks a lot of the other apps wanted a monthly subscription fee i paid for the pro version after using the free version since it was a one time payment
__label__3 yy
__label__3 i really like must of the app but it has 2 horrible bugs that made me uninstall it whenever i make a new event in the widget it places it a day after the date that i chose and then the edit button doesn't work and you are stuck with it and it might get confusing i might download it again if that is fixed
__label__3 it's good but it needs to link to other ms desktop apps rather than online cloud ms eg outlook opens in cloud not on desktop
__label__3 i just wish you could use this offline even if wouldn't record progress just make it accessible offline
__label__3 the photos that described what the app was about made it seem like the whitelist was just part of the app edit what what kind of a responce is that
__label__2 i have problem with purchasing the pro version when i click on buy pro button it says already purchased please restart the app i have not yet purchased it though and nothing happens when i restart the app
__label__5 i got this app to track my medication and it's perfect i can set up how i want to take each medicine yes no or quantity see the start date and adherence in the summary view and even track side effects and effectiveness each day then see them in a chronological list in the sunmary and the best part is that it's not tied to some medical database added bonus i can track real to dos as well overall love this app
__label__1 app no longer supported data loss likely was a great app until i needed to migrate to a new phone the sync feature never worked and i lost months of habit data i tried contacting the developer via the supplied email but zero response i used to recommend this app to many people but i'm done with it
__label__3 i like the ideas of the app however the biggest inconvience for me is when something happens that disrupts my routines there doesn't seem to be anyway to change the routine for one day with out changing it for every day in the futurs as well it is annoying to have to manualy change a routine and then have to change it back the next day i would like to see an option to edit or rearrage single intances of items in the time line without effecting the base routine or future dates
__label__2 excellent app but google assistant support integration is in coming soon state for about 2 yeas is there a chance to see it available in next 5 or 10 years
__label__2 does not sync with ms exchange calendar
__label__3 i love it but the app keeps crashing when i try to invite friends to party and i can't buy gems
__label__1 dislike the latest widget downgrade the loss of the ability to select multiple tasks is frustrating not sure how long i will stick with this app now as the widget is far less user friendly than previous version
__label__5 this is the best to do application i've ever used i've tried a lot and i love the way this one breaks down the lists into today tomorrow upcoming and someday i would definitely recommend it
__label__5 an amazing app helped me to become more productive and disciplined only downside is is that i wish it was compatible with my laptop so that i can always be reminded of my time schedule other than that an amazing app would totally recommend this
__label__5 you can customize color and transparency of every single part of the widget you can click on events for detail view
__label__3 very litle one
__label__2 i like this app but one thing that i hate why do i have to be member of premiums i mean why do i have to pay if i want to track up more than 5 habit this is a free app right please can you consider or change something about it
__label__5 genuinely i have tried a bunch of different to do apps and this one is by far the best genuinely has every feature that you'd want you can organise things in so many different ways big props
__label__5 adds not to frequent good time tracker
__label__5 this app really helps me even if i'm not studying or hanging out with friends i like that you have too set a time for how long you want to do things but i wish that if you wanted to leave the end the time you would have a withered tree in your forest other then that i think the app is awesome
__label__2 i love the app but i wish there was a separate page for notes i know that you can add notes when you create a task but i'd like to see a designated page just for notes other than that i never liked subscription models i think way more people would actually buy it myself included if it would be a one time fee
__label__5 excellent for keeping on your toes
__label__3 update the accidental deletion problem described below is compounded by my now finding a confirm before deleting setting that simply does not work the app is nice but when starring or opening a list item it's easy to delete it that's because deleting happens when you slide an item left and that can happen by accident either add a working setting to optionally require confirmations of deletes or provide a trash can from which you can recover deleted items
__label__3 should not need to tap a notification alert each time i add a new item should be by default like almost every other app in testing it has only not worked once could be great
__label__2 seems like it could be very helpful getting very frustrated with it always opening on monthly view even though i have weekly view selected in settings even tried switching it but no matter what opens on monthly
__label__3 feature request natural language support when typing 'today at 3 pm' or 'tomorrow at 10 am' it should understand and set the due dates accordingly as in wunderlist
__label__3 this app need to be more compeleted
__label__2 after update i couldn't log in to my google account the button allow wasn't working after applying the workaround and setting an email in web version my app on the phone requested permissions to my contacts i allowed it the pop up in the app did not disappear after pressing 'ok' several times it went away however now the app doesn't fetch the information from the cloud i wanted to buy pro not anymore you can't fix the bug with google account for several months now embarrassing
__label__3 just lowered my rating used to work great but now does not properly sync everything in my task list with my google calendar on my computer it will sync new events new tasks but if i edit a task ex change the date of the task it does not sync properly w my google calendar it used to be that all edits synced appeared the same in both the app my google calendar but not now i have been emailing with the support for this app but have not yet found a solution
__label__3 still testing
__label__3 i will rather pay one time update my rule is i never my buy subscription based apps doesn't make sense
__label__1 my go to for years until the last update ads used to be unintrusive now you have to wait 10 seconds after every calendar update for the ad to run uninstalling now
__label__2 syncing with alexa takes over 10 15 minutes which renders it unusable any do before you post your generic response yes i added the skill to my alexa and yes i logged into my accounts it syncs kind of so i can verify the two accounts are talking just not well at all when i use wunderlist or google tasks or just alexa by itself the changes are instantly viewable across all platforms the only reason i downloaded with app was to give me more control over my alexa lists which for some insane reason you cannot reorder the extremely lag in syncing any do with alexa renders this app useless the ui looks really nice and user friendly so i bumped it up to 2 stars
__label__3 the new update remove the option to change only one event when it is on repeat now i need to copy and select and could have more colors paid version
__label__5 it's a beautiful digital calendar that u can customize with a cover and stickers and fonts so much prettier than the standard calendar that comes on your phone
__label__1 misleading all themes require pro
__label__4 this product does everything that i need for it to do and all that it says that it will do it is easy and friendly to use and i enjoy it greatly and truly do rely on it daily
__label__5 love it
__label__3 great way to start to get organized
__label__3 app is working great except i cannot see my tasks in my calendar i'll change it to 5 stars after this synching capability is added
__label__4 this is the best planning app i ever tried however i subscribed to the ads free version but i'm still getting a message telling me to subscribe to unlock the extra features i also get the same message whenever i rotate the phone to landscape mode actually the button that advertises for the full version did not go away even after buying it
__label__2 had high hopes for this because it had everything i wanted but the completed tasks that i keep putting as completed come back the next day which is just irritating have tried all the settings to get of it but i can't and can't be bothered to persevere anymore
__label__4 superb
__label__4 really like this app the layout and ease of use however i did not see a way to go back and edit your scheduled days everything else you can edit time date category but wanted to change my days and i had to delete the entry and start over to modify my scheduled days otherwise i would've rated it 5 s
__label__4 i wish to buy the pro version and also encourage my friends and family to do the same but hope you can make some improvements to the app the ui looks very minimal which is a vanilla android template for an app development please make the ui a bit more appealing we would have also like to do routines that are repeated in intervals of more than 15 days present app doesn't allow me to set a monthly routine hope the icons can be more rich and appealing
__label__4 good
__label__4 quite a good app for me
__label__1 do not have the account sync feature how we backup data when we change device
__label__5 it works great
__label__3 not sure what happened but now i have to hit the sync button every time to get my calendar to sync i've deleted the app and reinstalled and still having the same problem
__label__1 doesn't sync to calendar
__label__4 easy to use i will however like to have a time boxing feature for my daily activities
__label__3 just add 'to do list' feature highly recommend
__label__1 kicks me out everytime i use it now i regret installing the new version i also don't want to uninstall as i don't think i have backup help
__label__4 this app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned liferpg app and from a bit of digging so far i'm impressed some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so i'll probably bite on that once i've set up everything and used the app a bit one suggestion i'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events like bringing up a reminder when i'm near the gym or store
__label__3 this app is amazing it would be better if the app was able to be used without internet though
__label__3 pretty good app to take notes and lists 1 for the smart snooze feature however it's disappointing that there's no reliable way of backing up all your data even with premium the only option is to log in using a browser and manually export a backup but an automated scheduled export within the app would be way better
__label__4 liking it a lot so far but i don't get it doesn't give a warning ring before tasks i put in that's kind of the main thing i need it for to remind me of tasks i had previously put in
__label__3 it always crashh
__label__3 it would be higher rating but i can't delite some events i don't need anymore for example i still have reminder to pay a credit card which i don't have anymore for 2 years if there is a way of deleting the same please tell me i'll give it 4 stars also too complicated time consuming setting exact time you want a reminder for an event
__label__4 overall i love the app but with the most recent update i'm experiencing an issue where it appears trees cost more coins than they display for instance i cannot purchase a 600 coin tree with 673 coins because i don't have enough coins also last night i had 1272 coins and bought a 600 coin tree bringing my balance down to 501 if this could be fixed i'd love to go to 5 stars i literally use this app all the time
__label__4 i have barely began using this app less than 15 minutes and i am already in love the terms you have to agree to alone are just so assuring and satisfying kudos developers kudos
__label__1 not advisable to anyone
__label__5 nice to be able to turn certain calendars on or off
__label__5 amazing app would recommend it to anyone just wish it had more icons for activities does that come with premium too
__label__3 great app new adds not so much
__label__3 why do not work reminders repeated monthly at all one time yes repeated no what is wrong
__label__3 it would be higher rating but i can't delite some events i don't need anymore for example i still have reminder to pay a credit card which i don't have anymore for 2 years if there is a way of deleting the same please tell me i'll give it 4 stars also too complicated time consuming setting exact time you want a reminder for an event
__label__4
__label__1 terrible app it didn't let me put my whole schedule in and it insisted me to buy the premium version which i'm not going to do 4 99 for an app that doesn't even work that well no thanks bye and it restarted my whole damn thing like wth bch
__label__1 i couldn't even make an account it wont work
"__label__3 great idea but would be better if it was stand alone and not dependent on 
google calendar to input times events"
__label__1 i don't like that i was able to link my account through wunderlist and my gmail but my husband is being promoted to create a microsoft account to have access if i am going to have to create a microsoft account i will be deleting this app i don't want need another account to manage wunderlist was much better
__label__3 please make the widgets more customizable and make us able to change the background transparency edit looks like you didn't understand i'm talking about the background transparency of the widgets again if you didn't understand i'm talking about the ability to change the background transparency the blackish background which makes the contrast higher and isn't necessary on wallpapers which aren't too bright
__label__3 i don't get any notification on the tasks to be done neither do alarm work and so i am get frustrated pls do help me with this apart from that it is a good habit tracking app
__label__4 productivity gamefied as has been said before the natural successor to liferpg looks like they just ripped the source code tbh but it irons out many of its predecessors bugs pity they monetised it in every available orifice fukugly full screen ads in app purchases for trivial customisations and an absurdly extortionate subscription all conspire to overshadow the app itself as does the uninspired graphic design and the use of unexciting headings that detract from its gaming usp
__label__3 overall decent experience main areas i'm not happy with are ui design choices lots of wasted space and navigational steps that could be improved wish i could see the content in more compressed format also no night dark theme which is important to me when using an app i night pull up before going to sleep or in early morning
__label__3 it was ok but only the first instance of the recurring events shows up on the list calendar it is important to see how recurring events impact the schedules in the future so users can avoid scheduling something on those dates times
__label__5 it's just as good as wunderlist and so much more
__label__3 i really enjoyed the experience of using this app i like it but it doesn't work offline so i can't use it properly so please make it offline or at least se fundamental features
__label__2 i like the app but for the past day i haven't got any notifications
__label__5 perfect task tracking app i absolutely love automatically set repeated tasks for example you write pay rent every 25th and the task sets repeat every 25th day of month
__label__4 excellent
__label__3 like everything about the app except my events kept disappearing i would enter an event and one would disappear
__label__5 great app
__label__1 waste of time unusable cannot delete events
__label__5 after searching through loads of todo list apps finally found one that works for me great interface very customiseable sad that some features are locked behind premium but works fine for free
__label__2 why would i pay for this app for reminders it's just a goddamn simple feature
__label__4 good app
__label__4 love ticktick it's almost perfect i'd love to see the following features added subtasks within subtasks like todoists option to assign repeating tasks to repeat after completion rather than due date i have an automatic cat feeder that lasts five days then i need to be reminded but if i postpone a day or two and then check it off it sets to repeat five days after the original due date instead of after i check off option to configure inbox behavior include tasks from other lists
__label__4 i love this app and the widgets are awesome 1 star lost because i am frequently getting pop ups about 5 a day stating it stopped and to restart app and there is no update available i might uninstall if this continues and it gets on my nerves for now works for what i need it for
__label__3 i love this app but there's only one problem i can't sign up or sign in i was able to sign up using google chrome but when i try to do so in the app itself it doesn't work please can this be fixed i would like to be able to sync across devices
__label__1 i couldnt even get past setting everything up before it glitched i couldnt move on from types of goals a pop up showed up that said something about strength and attributes
__label__2 there are full size ads that block your entire screen incredibly disruptive and i don't want to reward that by buying pro there are other calendar apps out there that don't deliberately disrupt your productivity
__label__4 a bit inconvenient interface when adding and asigning date to the task other than that pretty cool intuitive ui along with minimalistic style my first choice of todo app even free version is good enough to keep your plans out of your head but in this app
__label__3 it's okay why not a simple yes no box instead or colored circles it's really confusing also not a fan of the general navigation
__label__4 helpfull
__label__2 i have to agree that the full screen time draining ads are not viable for a business calendar regardless of the reasoning behind it by all means keep the small rolling ads along the bottom of the screen or alternatively charge a more reasonable fee to go pro 6 is not an option when there are so many other options out there such as acal which i used to use before bc and am now reverting to i'll keep an eye on business calendar though because if you change the ad situation or make the pro price more reasonable i'll certainly be back
__label__3 app needs work poor sync with website
__label__3 needs a lot more sophistication
__label__3 its good nd loved it but need to more developed
__label__4 paid experience is better than free but it will do since there are no ads ui and design can be made note clutter free
__label__4 great app
__label__5 really amazing and helped me sooo much just i hope that it can be sharable by more than one person for group planning one line and it will be world organizer or making groups thanx for developers
__label__5 it is so nice and useful app thanks a lot developers
__label__2 skips reminders until i pick up and check my phone then they go off
__label__3 hi how can i get this app on my galaxy watch 46mm regards
__label__3 i have to uninstalled this app on my phone soon i open the apps and trying to make things to do list it worked fine just i have trypophobia and those small circles dot just freaking me out edit the small circles dots that i mean here is when i click new list next we fill the list name and it appears with small circles dots in color for me who's having this kind of phobia that kind of design is just scary aside of that your apps seems to be simple and easy to use
__label__1 the first 2 slides are black and i can't see character in the character creation some message saying path 'profile' required habitica i hope this gets fix soon until then i i'll wait
__label__1 36 per year for push notification reminders no thanks
__label__4 handy habit helper
__label__3 my settings kept on changing ever time i reopen the app for example fear is set to zero when i open the app again fear is set to 80 why please fix this it's getting tiresome to re do the settings over and over
__label__4 rlly good just 4 for bugs but it's really good
__label__2 loved it untill recently when it started playing adds eveytime i put in an appointment now ill have to get a new calender app after years of using it and loving it too bad
__label__5 this is a great organizational tool it literally combines all my relevant tasks in one place
__label__5 great easy works fine no problems
__label__4 good app but a big improvement would be to have categories for a grocery shopping list i add things as i run out but that is not how they are found in the store i would like to group item by product type so i don't miss getting something or have to backtrack
__label__3 this app really helpful to focus on your task before i update forest for the last version the tree always dies if i open other apps but after i updated the tree is still growing although i open other apps
__label__5 love it downloaded it and deleted it over the years and everytime i get it back i get so amazed at the amazing new features it helps me straighten up my life thank you
__label__4 fun and easy to use creative and helpful way to track tasks and habits
__label__5 this app is practical beautiful fun and easy to use highly recommend
__label__3 whenever i open it i have to turn my phone sideways because it's locked in horizontal even after i turn on auto rotate
__label__1 used it once and cant use it again cus it crashes
__label__2 i liked using this app but i recently noticed that important information i had saved in sub tasks has all been deleted its happened before and i thought i had made a mistake but no it's just this app malfunctioning
__label__3 as a replacement for wunderlist this is ok but needs a faster way to share lists to known people rather than sending a new invite per list
__label__1 i use it for awhile then deleted it is take more time to use than other note apps confusing and have no reason to keep it many better note apps out there
__label__1 as soon as i downloaded the app and made a new account i couldn't create a new character because under the body skin and other options to make your character was blank when i changed my display name i got a weird message for 'profile name' required the randomize button didn't even work for me either i left originally because there were many bugs with to do's and other things and i'm not confident it's functional past the character creator so i don't see a point to continue on the s10e
"__label__3 okay thing is this app is almost gender biased the starting avatar it 
gave is already set in female and you'll have to earn something to get 
beard and mustache i thought it will be custom task set ups but it's 
already given lags a bit too"
__label__2 i had to buy this app because i need that larger widget to fit my needs and you cannot test it out with the free version sadly it's too buggy to be of any use at least on the aio launcher still overall better than my last habits tracker but i feel ripped off
__label__2 i used to love this app but they made the ads much more intrusive taking over the full screen with countdown timers any time you do anything i guess i'll go back the regular google calendar app reply to developer that'd be great if you remove the terrible ads for now i'm uninstalling and checking out other calendar apps
__label__5 perfect
__label__4 ok
__label__3 everything is premium lots of useful things are premium and you actually have to buy them everything except that is good
__label__3 it was fine until i found that to use features like syncing or transferring lists from an older app i had to upgrade to and pay for premium felt like bait and switch
__label__2 i had wunderlist but it changed to microsoft to do to do is more clunky than wunderlist it does not currently group starred items by category it does not have a variety of theme back grounds and the sharing of lists with others had to be done list by list and was unnecessaryily time consuming i am hoping to see significant improvements in thia app
__label__5 very good app
__label__2 do you wish to not be a retard well too bad simply owning this app means you acknowledge how useless you are to life and should instead of uninstalling the app uninstall yourself irl 2 stars because the app is not entirely useless it signals to others that you're a complete moron with no social capabilities
__label__3 music doesn't play as notification of reminder hate it i had skipped my one routine
__label__1 waste of time failed to pair with mu gmail account gave up after 5 attempts
__label__3 it was good now alatm sound of tasks is full but sound is low only this app i have seperate alarm volume and its full
__label__3 good experience nice concept sad that it's not completely free for a to do list and completely frustrating that it keeps crashing everytime i want to edit my level and changing my avatar it went brainfarted when it got overwhelmed by a long list of levels starting from 50
__label__2 the program is very good on my old phone galaxy note 4 but notifications don't work on the new one redmi note 8 pro i hope you will fix them thanks
__label__3 hi how do i add back my premium account i deleted account by mistake
__label__1 microsoft bought an already mature application spent 4 years working on it and this is all they have to show for it perhaps they could add more technical resources to support the 2 high school students that currently support this product poorly integrated with outlook simple too simple has very few features or functionality
__label__4 love it so far i would like to be able to move appointments around on the same day for example they are listed in the order you enter them but i want my am on the top of each page and my p m appointments in the afternoon on the month view it would be great if you can just drag and drop i also would like a printing feature for my lists so that i can actually print them out while packing
__label__3 when i goto monthly view press the date the event is on the previous date shows up sometimes i am able to scroll forward to the date i am looking for but mostly not for example i scroll april 24th and april 23rd shows up i like the design of the app would like to see yearly view i also can't see events i posted unless i rotate the phone but it works for tasks and notes tabs fine
__label__2 free version does not allow you to view all your events in the monthly view i only see colored dots that indicate an event is scheduled i would like to see the event names i contacted support but sadly did not get a response
__label__4 it's a great app you can search for words in tasks the reminders show up on my new samsung s10 which is why i had to ditch keep to get five stars i would like to see an easy way to access the app on my desktop it would be great if it would work with google calendar
__label__5 great
__label__2 i hate how you cannot open the app and see all your lists there you have to have one open at all times and it does not show a list of your list on the home screen deleting this app for this reason too bad the rest is great but they need a home screen they don't have one
__label__4 good job
__label__5 love it
__label__1 after the last update i can't connect to the app anymore with my vpn turned on which is extremely annoying
__label__2 it's not worth the premium i tried to get a refund because it wasn't what i thought it would be and no one has contacted me they claim to read every single email but can't reply to a paid customer i will be deleting this app and regretting the 8 purchase
__label__3 i genuinely think it is great but i feel like there are still a lot of features that still can be improved one of them is the whitelist feature i bought the premium version in app but i am not satisfied with it the reason for that is the whitelist give to much leniency when planting trees i plant the trees for various different reasons such as studying excersising relaxing etc however i need some apps to be available in certain activity while unavailable in others my suggestion is to apply different whitelists for different tags of activities this will surely help me to be less distracted by other apps during a certain activity i hope this improvement will be made and if so i will gladly changed my ratings of the app
__label__4 so cliche first u make people addicted to something then u put a price on it not all the countries have the possibility to purchase please add hijri shamsi to any do's calendar the christian month names and other calendar features are not any recognizable for we persians using shamsi calendar month names
__label__5 amazing work done for this app i have looked for a long time for an app which was fast well developed and really easy to use keep this way always
__label__5 i love this app it is an easy to use and appealing format i like being able to move items around on my list of taks without having to re type or cut and paste i like the option to leave completed items on the list or have them automatically deleted i would recommend this app to my friends looking for a good app to help with to do lists
__label__1 todoist is garbage nevermind the idiotic text based method for creating daily tasks this stupid app seems to think every day is a suggestion even with premium been using this app for three weeks every few days it refuses to renew my daily tasks scheduled reminders disappear curse blast whoever eol'd wunderlist cuz it was perfect for my needs this todoist trash not at all i will cling to wunderlist until the very end
__label__4 good
"__label__3 it's ok there's no actual options to make a list i have to number each 
item task action etc myself in paragraph form there's no proper list 
formatting in there besides that it's alright not what i had hoped"
__label__3 only works fine when app is on screen which means i can't press home button or switch apps while i wait for my tree to finish it is mildly irritating because i use other apps to study but still thank you for this app it motivates you to be productive by rewarding you cute cool trees
__label__3 reduced one star because there is a pro version 5 stars rated when there is another pros version it cant be right reduced for another star because i suggest that you should have a 'pause session' check it out from the study bunny
__label__5 really useful for time management
__label__3 works fine for importing calendar can't say same for tasks os linux
__label__2 great app that suffers from the most annoying design flaw every time i create a task it goes to the bottom of the list i always want the task at the top so i can see it that's the whole point of using a to do list so i have to drag the task one by one to the top makes me crazy
__label__5 i've tried different calendar apps for a few years now and this is the one that i have decided to keep for the longest time the monthly view is very neat event creation offers a lot of option and colors are easy om the eyes too
__label__5 simple does exactly what i want
__label__1 widget has stopped working and the developer is unresponsive
__label__3 the app isn't working properly it keeps getting stuck and the notification app not responding keeps popping up
"__label__3 could be a lot better i wish we were able to check off items in our 
routine as we finish them so we can move on to the next task i would also 
like to see a timer associated with the routines so we can see if we are 
falling behind or are ahead of the time we have budgeted i have my morning 
routine but it has multiple tasks within it if we were able to condense 
my tasks into the routine it would make things look more organized all in 
all a very good app if you want to stay organized but i don't think i 
wouldn't use this app until the mentioned points are added if these all 
exist already please let me know because i couldn't figure out how to get 
to them"
__label__2 widget is buggy a task marked as completed in the app is displayed as overdue and trying to tick it off in the widget takes me into edit mode the proper app when reopened shows a blank inbox and revisiting the screen is required to populate it again poor punctuation eg 28 sep 2017 why the space before the comma is not that big a deal but also adds to the app not feeling very pro
__label__3 there are ads even though there wasnt any label of contains ads in this app description
__label__3 hvn try
__label__2 was and is a great app used it for years but now the fullscreen ads are an immediate turnoff small ads down the bottom were fine but forcing me to sit through a full screen ad till the timer runs out is a huge no for me uninstalling cos there are plenty of other free calendar apps around that don't force you to wait through adverts
__label__2 beneficial to get my goal it's heplful to make discipline and commitments to yourself it's continually popping up notification that what you have decided according to your time table over all its good and helpful for students
__label__3 helpful
__label__2 update i did all the steps still not working it is getting frustrating i really love this app but off late it just keeps crashing can anybody help updated thanks for the reply there was no auto update option in my phone settings so i have disabled auto update in google play will it work
__label__4 a great idea and the app itself has been improved a fair bit but still a little bit too slow to respond to give five stars seems a bit like server congestion maybe
__label__5 great simple app i wish it easily sync'd across devices i also would love a calendar view i can see print so i can visually see my progress over time
__label__3 i like the calendar but get really annoyed at having to constantly change the colours as they keep going back to default
__label__2 does not show morning event's
__label__5 good app does what i need it to
__label__4 one or two minor hiccups when inserting advance appointments which resulted in a difficulty with getting the diary back to 'todays' date i had to turn the phone on and off in order to correct this also had problems with the app widget failing to download after the phone has been turned on other than those issues the diary has been great i would love to have more options to customise the appearance of the app eg background or page colour options only work when you insert an appointment
__label__4 it has a button just for what i need i bit hard to read the scheds though
__label__4 i really like the concept of this app the style the features and it has done its part in motivating my studies and organizing my life however the app needs some serious redesigning the layout is difficult to navigate and the chat function is almost useless the way challenges are organized could also use improvement all in all i like using it make an account a month ago but the functionality needs to be improved
__label__5 it was good because it had the time in form of a clock it told you the time before a session it told you the time each session lasts but since i dont have premium it doesn't let me choose different colors which is not too bad yet i would like that option for free
__label__5 adds not to frequent good time tracker
__label__5 i love habitica i love the social aspect of it if it didn't have the social media portion of it i probably would have unistalled it as soon as i installed it the social portion of it gives me a reason to check it and reminds me to try and meet my goals
__label__3 there is no option for repeated activities is a few hours i will give 5 star and uninstall todoist if i can set 'every hour every 3 hour' so far this app is better than todoist
__label__5 great to help habits nip them before they ruin your life
__label__2 fix the lag on moving events on the day display and i'll subscribe again ux is clunky get a second opinion
__label__4 user friendly and plenty of bells and whistles
__label__1 it wouldnt sync to my google calendar i had it set up and everything
__label__3 i wanted this for my tablet and like the features like tasks a calendar etc but i'm disappointed it is locked on landscape position instead of allowing it to rotate to portrait position if they fixed that one detail it would be a winner for me
__label__2 i really liked the app but suddenly from nowhere all of my data were gone one second they were fine then when i connect to the internet it's back at lvl 0 with the johnny avatar it seemed that there was no way to get my data back dropbox saved data seemed to have been overwritten so idk what to do i feel betrayed being immersed in the apo then suddenly left hanging with the fact that i don't even know what caused it
__label__4 no issues so far integrates nicely with all the software i use
__label__5 best app for planning and scheduling jst bless u developers
__label__3 only premium is good free version has nothing
__label__3 the feature that i liked in wunderlist is that you could move items around on your list manually this is missing from this app
__label__5 very nice app it helped me feel more motivated i can now see life more as a game and as something that's supposed to be fun
__label__3 it don't work with samsung gear s3 smart watch even after i bought tge widget
__label__3 it works great for me but my friends are dealing with the days not reseting and aren't able to deal damage our monster please i cant do this alone our party needs help
__label__4 pretty good only issue i noticed is that if you undo claiming a reward that has its price increase each claim it can give you extra coins back aside from that a lifetime purchase option would be nice i try to avoid subscriptions where possible so i'm sticking with using this for free for now and an option to hide the parts that require a subscription instead of showing them but asking you to pay when you click them would be nice e g so the calendar doesn't even show up on the bottom
__label__4 i like the interface my only problem is awkward birthday calendar
__label__4 i love the app but the only thing i hate about this app is that 1 does not have a start and end time for tasks 2 stop showing task for the next day 3 sort the tasks based on start time or reminder time
__label__3 this app should be made to work around certain schedules for example people who work the third shift graveyard shift have a completely different schedule than say a person who works a 9 5 7 3 3 11 etc i'm certain this adjustment would be greatly appreciated
__label__2 i ws kinda disappointed because i really loved the user interface of the app and how smooth it flows from one set up to another however i have to uninstall and install it back up several time because it will not accept the 4digit password i have set it up with i had to do it like 10 times but still like the app tho i hope that bug will be fixed sooner
__label__3 it is a cosy and user friendly to do app
__label__3 i have been using this app for about a year now without any issues so i'm definitely not fond of the new routines menu i find that swiping from side to side for the days to be much easier and having the drag and drop feature to be more comfortable hope it will be implemented again soon also the fact that you can't move a blank time frame up and down makes it difficult to set up the routine as i have to change the time of every item to move it down i would prefer the old version hopefully it all gets fixed soon
__label__5 love it
__label__1 i use the pro version but what happened to the option to purchase holidays my christian and jewish holidays don't show up anymore
__label__3 i use todoist every day and it is awesome service in general but the latest update to the widget made it absolutely unusable for me it has too slim lines even without compact mode compact is ridiculous even though i have small fingers the quick button to open the main app is gone and the worst it is now not possible to select more tasks and do anything quick with them bye bye fast rescheduling i am greatly upset it is my main tool for staying on track
__label__4 not always reminder message pop up sometimes missing time or day
__label__1 warning malevolent app features intrusive pop ups as soon as you unlock the phone and without even activating the app high possibility of crashing your phone
__label__3 helps me stop touching my phone it helps me stop touching my phone however there is not much thrill in planting the tree you cannot select where the tree is going to grow and eventhough there are number of other trees it cost so much and earn so little from planting it makes it so boring it can get quite dissapointing
__label__1 usless
__label__3 i bought the premium version because the app said this would allow me to create routines for a bunch of specific dates but i cannot find this feature i'm a casual worker and my routines are based around different morning afternoon and night shifts that don't fall on any usual days of the week
__label__4 i love this app i tried many to do list apps but this is the one that meets my satisfaction i guess the basic features are good just right but i'll give it 4 stars since i'm still finding something i myself can't say and it's not here maybe it's in the premium version but i'm broke as hell and i can't afford to pay for it because i have other expenses i do hope that some other features would someday be free it'll be really helpful
__label__1 after installing the app i check to see if my reacurring event would show up and it did that one time so minutes after i insalled i had to let it go
__label__3 it's a useful app have maybe some things to improve like the habit set up is not very clear or intuitive
__label__3 booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
__label__3 has any do changed the way moment works five stars for me until recently and not sure if it's associated with change to android 10 or a change with the app i used to have moment pop up daily i no longer get moment nor continued pop up on screen reminders for tasks throughout the day just looking for clarification that these are no longer features in the non paid version
__label__4 not the best but better than others
__label__4 i think this app is great only problem is it's very easy to close out of the app without the timer stopping and your plant dying
__label__4 i have been utilizing ticktick todo list for awhile now its a very solid application that helps ensure the important tasks in one's life are completed on time
__label__4 the new widget is an improvement but the fact that i can no longer open the app from the widget is immensely frustrating it means i have to waste home screen space in the app icon and isn't that what a widget is supposed to avoid
__label__3 awesome
__label__2 new update to the widget makes it so i can no longer get into the full app by tapping on the widget i actually have to go into my list of apps or create a whole other shortcut you tout a fully operational widget but i can't rearrange my list entries via the widget only the full app menu and it was already a pain to rearrange my tasks in the first place i really really wish there was an option to add new tasks to the top of the list rather than the bottom i will be trying out new to do list apps now
__label__4 very helpful for busy scheduled hard workers
__label__1 didn't like it it's connected to the calinder
__label__3 it's really confusing its hadd to make routines and stuff just over all really confusing but over great way to track routines i love the tag idea mabey you should add a default school tag
__label__3 this app would be fantastic if the calendar integration also picked up repeating events in my google calendar but it doesn't i need to see all that's on my calendar in order to properly plan after the second repeated event it shows a blank calendar day which is inaccurate this alone makes it just another to do list app without productivity functionality
__label__4 i love the app it's a great way to stay focused especially with all the quarantining going on however i have one issue with this app the ambient noises you can play don't loop properly and become glitchy if you let them play for too long
__label__5 it's a great up easy to use and very helpful if you want to create new habits and track your progress
__label__2 quite good one but i prefer single purchase option but seriously i like the statistics well i saw it automatically logs out and not doing backup
__label__4 why this app sends me notifications 30 seconds late
__label__3 would be awesome except when i put start in weekly view in the settings i can no longer access monthly view or change the settings
__label__5 awesome app i now remember to take my medication drink my water and have my to do list it has been extremely helpful and productive
__label__2 i couldn't sync this with my work email and doesn't seem to give me the option to
__label__3 the app is glitchy notification alarms fail i have to frequently update the time in the app it often shows wrong timing these issues prevent a 5 star rating
__label__4 good app with good widgets one star deducted as i can't work out how to view completed tasks dailies and habits
__label__3 glitchy but good
__label__3 it's a good app however i'm disappointed that thr alarm doesnt ring and bevause i missed the remainder i had to pay overdue library fees edit the app's creator is responsive and lovely thanks for the advise steve
__label__2 could not get app to consistently stay connected to my google calendars
__label__3 leave it to microsoft to screw up wunderlist i used it for my show notes while i was out and about i could input my note and it would go to the top of the page now it goes through the bottom and i have to drag every single note to the top it's annoying
__label__4 the app concept is so great it drives people to work on but there is an issue when i try to remove withered trees i click on watch ad to remove then it opens an ad but suddenly disappears the ad and it doesn't remove my wethered trees
__label__2 i love the feature where you can type the timing in the name of the task this app has great features but one thing doesnt seem to work its the reminders i'm neverrrrr of my tasks i never get the notifications i tried everything that was wriiten in the reminders not working but it still has not been fixed could u please look into it asap
__label__3 when the screen goes off and you on your phone but did not press into an app the tree will be killed and waste your efforts a lot of features are also locked and only premium which doesn't help with productivity the achievements sector of the app cannot be seen and the tress dies without reasons
__label__1 the app opens it self up whenever it wants to display an ad but the screen remains the same but i cant press anything so it just opens up in the background all day long to display ads and make money when im not even using the app this feature is ridiculous and it started happening every 5 minutes as opposed to every now and then so i just deleted the app
__label__4 super great app just installed and l feel already familiar with two comments it would be great to have the possibility to change time setting with digital clock and not only timepiece visual second having the possibility to set a reminder based on the location not only time as proposed by other to do applications otherwise the app is looks really great congrats to the developers
__label__1 could be as good as wunderlist was but please change the new tasks to appear at the top of the lists
__label__5 it cool
__label__4 seems almost perfect i'm missing a monthly view feature of the tasks assignments etc
__label__3 great app lots of ads
__label__1 sync problems
__label__4 very useful app for establishing good habits i like the weekly view in particular also like being able to set the level of chatter and reminders done to the minimum in the free version
__label__2 you reaaallllyyy don't have a lot without paying
__label__5 easy to use and has all basic functions required
__label__3 could be better on samsung s6 not showing reminders on screen have to open the same as a diary
__label__3 good concept works fine helps to avoid phone addiction but the problem with this app is that it crashes everytime when updated several times i installed and then uninstalled it that led to loss of data and time tried your way not available in my device problem still persists
__label__3 great app but why can't i add an attachment i need this functionality and although i have been using bc for years i might have to go to google calendar
__label__3 slightly glitchy and missing some features you'd expect syncing between desktop web and mobile is nice missing parity between all though
__label__3 one of the billions of to do lists app nothing special unpredictable non intuitive behavior as usual useless hints for features that are obvious i've thrown this app away after the third time when i accidentally removed my task while simply scrolling the list
__label__5 it's a good app
__label__2 yeah keep everything for premium and then say its free
__label__5 resolveu minha necessidade de organização e produtividade diária demorei um pouco mas encontrei um app inteligente e fácil de mexer não tenho nenhuma queixa sobre a funcionalidade dele ou qualquer outra coisa
__label__4 very easy to use and intuitive wish there were a way to roll incomplete tasks forward to a new list or a different list i tend to make a list for each day otherwise love it
__label__3 this app is sooo good for and perfect for students add tasks at lightning speed and track your pomodoro sessions habits and tasks without problems
__label__2 it's motivating but pro mode is a disappointment now rather than being able to watch an ad for double coins at the end of a session i earn the same base coins with the option to pay real money for increased coin earning i already paid for pro mode and pro mode feels entirely necessary for the white listing feature without it even apps like a music player or calculator that are sometimes required to be used while you are focusing will kill your tree i feel ripped off
__label__5 so far this app has had a profound impact on me getting things done it does rely a bit on the honor system but if you're down for it it can be very good
__label__5 fun cover stickers and layouts
__label__3 no webapp no integration with other services google task calendar can't pause stop the current pomodoro
__label__2 edit there is some annoying bugs when assigning a date tomorrow is sometimes sent to next week and next week the week after i double checked my datetime settings good tool but removing a star because of the subscription model i would be happy to pay but a monthly fee is difficult to justify by the extra features being offered at least not for my usage
__label__5 nice
__label__2 plz share instructions on how to use on oneplus trees don't wither even after leaving the app
__label__4 works well
__label__2 seems like a good tool but almost nothing that i actually need to do with it is possible without a subscription i'd happily puchase the app or do a free trial period but honestly it annoys me when companies offer a free download only to put everything useful behind a paywall especially when they try to give a discount for a year's sub before you even really get to try the features nope
__label__3 the app does not let me create a widget despite the fact that i have logged in
__label__1 confusing
__label__5 best planner out there i love the ability to take notes journal track projects schedule events and to dos all in one place excellent
__label__3 parece una gran app pero no se me actualiza el idioma a español a pesar de que ya lo configure para que asi sea una lastima
__label__1 complete dumpster for here migrating from wonderlist we sync between two phones the list did not completely sync you have to share each list seperatly updates to a list did not sync the app keeps telling me things are being checked and unchecked i left the shared list and tried to rejoin and it would not rejoin microsoft ruined a great simple app look elsewhere until this is fixed
__label__4 this is a super cool and helpful app i love it my only criticism is that it could be a bit more user friendly it's easy to set up habits you want to do drink 8 glasses water per day but harder to set up i only want this many ___ per week additionally the funny reminders are funny because they're ridiculous i don't think an english speaker wrote them but i can't convince myself to disable them because they're so strange
__label__1 requires creating an online account to view the calendar therefore there is no reason to use this over google calendar
__label__4 the app is good i am using the pro version since years it works well with google calendar now i want to use my outlook calendar as well but i can not find the possibility to add an outlook calendar there do you have any suggestions for it
__label__1 ads too frequent didn't even finish setting up first days tasks
__label__4 its ok little confusing at first i think some more of the features that are in the add a blah should be a bit more clear also a report a bug option would be nice my entire phone is on silent cause im at work app still makes sounds
__label__4 awesome app wish had auto sort feature of priority task like franklin planner use to have
__label__1 only get about half of the reminders
__label__3 for 4 99 to 9 99 i'd like more widgets and customization as it stands the main widget list is block white
__label__5 great to do list app that handles reminders well it is perfect for my needs
__label__4 useful good notifications
__label__4 very interesting application just to complicated for me
__label__3 it's a good sentiment but it didn't really work for me i wanted to like it but the motivation for getting stuff outweighs the motivation to actually do the things you're supposed to and unless you join a guild or any sort of group there's no accountability if you don't want to use it as a social app then i can't imagine mustering up the focus and drive not to just lie
__label__4 one of the better cleaner to do apps could you please add recurring tasks based on day or date as an example recurring every wednesday take out trash
__label__5 one of the best app to stay focused on your study
__label__5 this app is awesome makes tasks fun
__label__1 worst app ever because there is no reminder bell things i think there is but it doesn't work i can't even remember that i have this app with reminder thing will be better i spent two hours to write my routine plan and i thought there is reminder it's not easy to use this app too i am deleting this useless app immediately alarm doesn't work at all how disappointing
__label__3 i am having issues with the purchased premium version but am not getting any reply to my email inquiries generally i found the app great but this lack of support is really disappointing
__label__1 the app is very good giving one star because data sync doesn't work even for paid version so if you change the phone you lose all tracking history and as others reviews are saying there is no service by developers
__label__2 suddenly with ads and paid content disappeared synchronization has some issues
__label__4 good enaught
__label__5 its a nice app for making routines
__label__5 it has added a bit of fun into my daily tasks which was something i didn't even know i needed until now
__label__1 new android widget is garbage full control yea ok you took away useful features and gave us more theme options can no longer open app from widget and most importantly you can no longer select multiple tasks from the widget which was super useful for rescheduling
__label__3 i like it however i can't seem to get the notification sounds to work they used to
__label__3 how do i disable voice note everytime i need to write something in todo list a google voice popup came out its ridicolous stupid and annoying i couldnt find the disable option in setting
__label__1 it was to difficult and takes a lot of time to create a routine
__label__4 this app is the simplest thing yet it makes such a big difference in my daily life i would only add the option to see the details of each task on the widget right now it opens the app by default which is not a major issue but it would be an improvement thank you for making my life easier
__label__4 неплохое приложение для поднятия своей дисциплины в игровой форме перейдем к минусам дорого за полную версию серьёзно 3400 рублей за полную версию навсегда это очень дорого мне кажется что автор случайно дописал лишний ноль 340 ладно 3400 дрого не всё доступно без полной версии это немного относится к первому минусу теперь плюсы повышение дисциплины в игровой форме например если быть чесным и выставлять адекватные награды то всё очень классно
__label__5 love the reminders
__label__2 why did you remove the ability to enter the main app from the widget the widget also has some serious performance issues and freezes often other than that it's a great app does its job and the web interface is really useful when you're on desktop
__label__5 superb păcat ca varianta premium e prea scumpa cu plata lunara sau anuala dacă avea un preț final și definitiv as fi cumpărat o
__label__3 it is ok bit too simple really and could do with a little bit of tlc and new features and just some developer input does the job though
__label__4 so far i really like it when will the stickers and tablet features be ready
__label__4 just started using the app and it doesn't scale with my phone's zoom settings so the icons on the bottom are cut off is there a way to fix this it doesn't seem to have its own zoom options more accessibility features would be great e g zoom contrast dexterity settings also it's great to see a wheelchair available for the avatar but it would be more inclusive and fun for more users if there were more types of default assistive devices canes walkers crutches braces glasses etc
__label__2 spending 10 once or 5 year for a subscription would make sense to me but paying 15 year to use a to do list when discounted is really excessive this is a great tool actually i love it but i find it ridiculous to pay so much just to temporarily unlock basic features like a calendar edit since writing the above review i've found cheaper free alternatives the one i'm using is called treat yourself it's free and doesn't look great but it serves my needs just right and i love it
__label__3 this app has a lot of potential but a few things could be added and tweaked i recommend adding a calender and more icon options
__label__4 only used for a day but it's the best app i've found for daily tasks to do lists would love to see the following 1 completed tasks move to the bottom 2 tasks be linked to a numerical value 3 the ability to order each item manually daily
__label__3 not as good as wünderlist sadly
__label__2 acalendar business calendar tiny calendar tick tick pro acalendar's design featurr and logic is from 2004 business calendar is better but still stupid and feels like from 2010 tiny calendar really improves from the 2 above nice modern design and good drag drop feature but still suffers the same wrong logic and bad design as business calendar tick tick is the modern calendar that wins because its designed with modern logic designed with proper modern features less touchpoints and jus
__label__1 the new full screen video advertisements make the basic version of this app unusable i'm looking looking for a replacement
__label__5 this is a great app it has made my life so much easier i have tried other apps but this one has to be the best one so far if you are thinking about getting it you should
__label__3 the app is very nice but it keeps crashing please fix this i don't want to uninstall this app it helps me soooo much after 2 days of downloading this app when i open it it will take me to my home page it wouldn't function i have to clear the data and restart for it to function again please fix this immediately thank you
__label__5 an amazing app helped me to become more productive and disciplined only downside is is that i wish it was compatible with my laptop so that i can always be reminded of my time schedule other than that an amazing app would totally recommend this
__label__3 i like how it allows me to set any number of reminders minutes hours days weeks in advance either by push notification or email but many little bugs pepper this app the calendar view will bug out and not map to the selected month from time to time the location field tries to be smart by giving you a 'maps like' autocomplete but this is annoying when you just want 'gym' for some reason the first letter of an event name isn't registered by autocorrect so 'event' turns to 'venting'
__label__3 i like the new jump day and insert gap options and the advice delay dialog for multiple activities the undo feature is a great addition as well i'm really disappointed with the new look and that vertical scrolling through makes it so much harder to use it's easier to start changing the wrong day since the current activity is not highlighted in any way and starting time is not that clear as before also those activity free time blocks take too much space yet there is not enough space horizontally for the text and a lot of the additional tags aren't visible i'd prefer a more compact look it would take a lot of time getting used to this
__label__1 cant use if i dont allow permission for contacts dumb
__label__3 it's good but it needs to link to other ms desktop apps rather than online cloud ms eg outlook opens in cloud not on desktop
__label__2 norton antivirus reported this as a malicious app and recommended i uninstall after paying for the pro version i felt it was very lacking no portrait mode on tablet no day mode on phone no way to adjust the length of a meeting beyond that of the default meeting settings
__label__4 have been using the old pro version on all my previous devices for years and liked it very much just started to use this new one not long ago it has a more contemporary design simplified and streamlined options but the change in drag n drop in weekly view costs it a star
__label__5 listen this is a great tool take the time to learn how to use it it will do great things for you if you are like me and value your time productivity and efficiency use this app as an android user i keep my agenda view along with all my tasks and lists as a widget to the left of my home screen i keep my calendar view to the right quick clean efficient
__label__2 day 2 of trialling this so far i've had two location reminders fail i can't label a location with more than one letter the only time based reminder that's fired did so while on a phone call so i don't know what it sounds like not that i can change the sound anyway because the instructions don't work i had no idea what the buttons meant so the first one tapped the task got snoozed for 28 hours how is that a typical snooze length adding anything more than a basic list item is not intuitive
__label__3 why can't i change a single event in a reoccurring series am i missing something it only has 'change this and future events' or 'change all events in series'
__label__3 clunky annoying lag time after button presses often won't update upon opening
__label__3 this app is great as far as the calendar and task functions however it is nearly unbearable to use since it doesn't respect the phone setting to not notify during a call when it notifies during a phone call using the regular carrier app not skype hangouts or other app it buzzes and sends a loud notification that is painful and very disruptive i sent in a support request 3 5 years ago and they said it shouldn't do that and they were going to look into it but they haven't fixed it in any updates and it's been the same on all of the different phones i've had since then not just an isolated issue on one phone
__label__3 it was ok
__label__2 the concept is good but the execution lacks there are constant issues with server sync and since the server side has priority updates i make on the phone regularly get wiped out every so often the app will prompt me to log in again when i open it this time it just kicked me out while i was actively using it and updating a list made me log in again and didn't keep anything i had already done my wife already gave up on it and i will probably look elsewhere too
__label__3 the app idea is great on itself however there are too many options blocked behind the pro version which one would think are basic whitelist and exporting the progress changing phones makes all the progress be lost moreover although not essential some free achievements would also be nice even if they don't give any coins i'm willing to change my rating if i see any of those changes since like i said the app is quite good already free version feels like less than a free trial
__label__5 excellent thank you i appreciate you having a free version without a time limit
__label__1 useless
__label__5 awesome app improved my efficiency by 80 pros integrates with google cal awesome ui ux
__label__3 nice app however one important feature missing in app is you can not assign the task to some other person this feature is there in desktop version and very useful in corporate environment
__label__3 i like the ideas of the app however the biggest inconvience for me is when something happens that disrupts my routines there doesn't seem to be anyway to change the routine for one day with out changing it for every day in the futurs as well it is annoying to have to manualy change a routine and then have to change it back the next day i would like to see an option to edit or rearrage single intances of items in the time line without effecting the base routine or future dates
__label__3 this is one of the better habit tracker app ive tried a couple of them i deleted after a few days just because they were so basic yet had the audacity to charge for a premium service habitica seems to be much more realistic and actually has a more detailed u i for setting yourself different kinds of targets habits but i would like to give this app 5 once they link this app to your clock and calendar apps or build in add more notification controls looking forwards to updates tbc
__label__2 this has the beginnings of a great app but lots more work still needs to be done
__label__2 it would be better if there are more options for customising the avatar and theme which is in purple you will need to spend money for a decent background the avatar is pixelated and doesn't look good getting a bit bored of it now
__label__5 great app unfortunately the price for the cloud sync the only premium feature i need is rather high
__label__3 disappointing and unreliable it's sad to see this app struggles to be as great as its predecessor wunderlist if you set a daily reminder and one day forget to mark it as complete the app will not remind you again about it if the due date and reminder date are different you will not be reminded about the task i don't care if i'm receiving a notification about a thing i had to do 3 weeks ago i just wanna be reminded no one is this strict with dates i hope this helps improve the app
__label__5 the app has great routine planner helps me keep organized it's important to me for someone with adhd
__label__5 this app os great for planning out your days its helped me become more effective at aticking to a plan the customer service is very quick and helpful
__label__5 very good
__label__2 was a great app but could not login since last month so bye bye planner pro
__label__5 customise and tailored according to your needs best for every class of jobs as well as for students for making their routine go for it guys
__label__3 widget stopped showing the correct day which makes it pretty much useless which sucks because it was the easiest way to use the app for me please fix
__label__5 great
__label__3 smart input while editings tasks should be same as when creating tasks
__label__2 when i share my task on whatsapp even though i selected share title and content it only shares title version 5 2 2 if i share my task in the form of image the task with long name the end of the name gets replaced with instead of showing the remaining heading on new line
__label__2 doesn't sync properly anymore have been using the free version of this calendar app with my google calendar for years without problems but for the last half year or so the appointments don't sync the invites don't get sent it has become unusable and unreliable i have had to switch to the google calendar app now
__label__2 would like questions answered i email my questions for answers i give my contact info for almost two months now but no one contacts me this is very disappointing especially when i bought this app very poor for business kevin
__label__3 best app
__label__2 why would tasks be tabs instead of a list the whole screen is empty and you make us scroll tabs o
__label__1 can't share lists with other people garbage app that is much worse than wunderlist
__label__2 osm app but now its update an i am not able to see my all reminders that i use to remind my self before uninstalling the app
__label__1 very bad don't download very complicated app
__label__5 best app it keeps me organise and it's great app exactly what i was looking for
__label__1 limited habits
__label__2 why would i pay for this app for reminders it's just a goddamn simple feature
__label__5 great app
__label__5 really useful app
__label__2 do not pay for upgrade if you upgrade it just messes the app up i have to manually change days every morning now if it weren't for that it'd be great please fix
__label__3 why won't my homescreen widget display all day events this makes it really difficult to use
__label__3 really hard to read when you have overlapping calendar items which is a shame as the concept of a circular 'clock' calendar is a good one
__label__3 a very good but incomplete idea there is no way to track time spent on certain habits there is a big difference between doing 5 minutes of something and doing it for 1 hour besides the statistics are super limited and basic
__label__5 great app
__label__2 used to be my favorite app changed phones and it doesn't recognize my premium purchase i've been emailing for support for two months with no response so disappointed
__label__3 it never reminds even thought i've set the reminder
__label__3 tasks cannot be ordered by their time a habit not done is not shown as overdue edit i checked again to use it but 1 recurring task cannot be created 2 habits are shown like scheduled tasks it's motivating to see habit progress instead on landing screen 3 it's more useful to see progress on habit activity instead of successful day if we set to do 2 times a day but we could do it only once it should show progress for a 30 day goal as 1 2 today 1 60 total instead of 0 30 or 1 30
__label__5 great app i like the way it looks like clock
__label__1 over basic definitely not worth 200 per year pictures shown are not what the app looks like
__label__2 not a fan liked the idea of diving into main areas and percentage of your day it occupates but what flipped me up was scheduling a reminder daily i started getting a morning reminder of the task for the next day schedule for i e 7pm i mean what about task i have for this day ahead i don't need to be notified 27hrs ahead of my daily rutine seriously
__label__3 good for notes needs export email options
__label__2 recurring tasks are very glitchy they sometimes change the day or time when they recur per any do's request i sent them a video of this happening crickets no explanation or acknowledgement and no refund as i requested fine otherwise but i rely on recurring items
__label__1 it doesnt do any thing its gliched everytime i open it
__label__5 started using it after having used many to do apps the ui is beautiful syncing is quite fast the companion apps are available for every major operating system plus it is also available on the web which is a big advantage over google tasks however i'd love to have natural language processing and a way to prioritise the tasks
__label__2 your app was gud but when i did reset my phone and install this again app doesn't work properly i can do whatever i want it doesn't protect me to other apps if i use other apps while tree is growing they don't die your app is really useless
__label__3 widget is not loading correctly when the phone is restarted all the time
__label__5 cute and entertaining definitely helping me to stop bad habits
__label__5 was sad to replace wunderlist but this app is really good i particularly like the my day feature and the fact you can see all your to dos for today all together
__label__2 it dont have alarm feature
__label__5 this calendar application is fantastic and it is very easy to use the best thing about it is that you can set multiple events and reminders it's great that it has up to 5 reminders that you can set for an event that you've made there's also a custom setting for setting reminders to any specific time of your choosing i'm also glad that it doesn't have autocorrect there are convenient weekly monthly and yearly views to choose from great calendar application i highly recommended it
__label__1 another update but the stats section is still totally useless and buggy week starts with sunday even i changed to monday on a sunday the stats resets and stays empty for the whole day to update the progress i have to exit and enter the app several times
__label__3 the app has started causing toasters to pop up frequently saying this widget will not be updated maximum memory is used for the same widgets i only have one instance of the widget running and plenty of free space i've removed it from my home screen for now the notifications are too annoying
__label__4 its a great app for those who understands the precious value of time it takes time to set your own schedule but once you start its fabulous keep modifying it to get best of it
__label__3 i don't know why this app is an editor's choice there isn't any special graphics and you need to be a premium to change a color keep google give me all this for free i was just looking for a different to do list where i could change the size of the letters
__label__5 it has everything i wanted i really love the habit integration and at first i didn't know you could back date habits but you can so now i am very excited to use this app long term and see how it goes beautiful design too
__label__3 critical
__label__4 app services are very best but its very expensive when i tap for subscribe yearly subscription google say your limit cross
__label__1 could be better pls fix the 'repeat' setting where i could accually pick the exact date and time for example i have to study during mondays tuesdays and fridays at 8 pm the app isn't very specific about it deeming it useless to me hoping for a better update
__label__2 купил версию pro сменился телефон что покупать снова тогда зачем такое приложение
__label__3 the app is good but it has a bug i use poco f1 in desktop widget it many times stop showing tasks just shows a black empty list when we remove it and add it back from widget list it works for some days but problem keeps on occuring times and again please fix it
__label__1 app is a pain to sync not user friendly in this regard used wunderlist for years then ms took them over and ruined it
__label__3 calendar has a lot of good features but half the time my reminders don't go off so i miss them paid for the full version but it still didn't help all of my friday reminders finally chimed on sunday kinda pointless
__label__3 i guess i am wanting the routines to have synched my calendar and not my timeline it is not clear how to keep track of my performance i am going to have to enter everything thing in my calendar into the routines bin
__label__5 bough the premium subscription for 37 aud worth every penny made a top firm list of things i need to sort out this week was wondering where to start for past couple hours checked out google creating a group for myself in whatsapp to remind astonightly undoubtedly worthy new whatsapp integrations let's you to be reminded whenever you set it to chartbots to the win
__label__3 it is useful but not the perfect
__label__2 decent app but does not seem to be able to sync with my google calendar without that it is pretty useless to me i like that sub tasks are listed as an indent to the main task not as a seperate task
__label__4 this is the best task keeping app out on the market it has a very easy interface and many useful features that are blended together well into a useful product
__label__5 clean design easy interface keeps me on task
__label__3 it's ok when we imported our list from wunderlist the list was duplicated my husband and i share a list for shopping when we connected through this new app every item on the list was duplicated frustrating to clean up
__label__4 can't fully scroll to the bottom of the options list of a task can't see the delete option fully
__label__2 i tested a few task apps and this one looked promising at first but very quickly i hit the paywall even for basic and essential features such as reminders and labels i'm going to use trello instead
__label__4 the essence and notion of this application is not just to define activities from day to day basis but to remind us that its really not about perfection its about progress this application teaches us not just to address holistically in our commitment and time management but also push drastically at the same time our attitude towards commitments senior project engineer here it really helps alot thank you
__label__2 it was a good app until this most recent update now my widget doesn't work it's not syncing with my calendars i'm losing dates appointments
__label__2 this app is a pretty good one but on my galaxy note it stopped allowing me to check off tasks for some reason i paid for the pro version before this happened unfortunately
__label__3 widget sering ngadat dan ndak update dengan hari dan jamnya butuhnya pasang widget agar terupdate tapi seringnya malah gak cocok dengan waktunya notifikasinya pun sering g muncul
__label__3 i love the concept of the app i'm just not digging the functionality trying to set a custom date and time is a complete pain in the you know what every time i select pm it's stays at am i have to do it multiple times before it catches same issue with the clock i try to rotate the dial to select an hour and it hangs and throws me over to minutes i go back to hours and it does the same thing i finally just gave up back to the old string around the finger
__label__3 this app is great if you know how to use it i downloaded it and it just doesn't work for me it says it's a routine app but it doesn't really let you put your whole routine it only let's you put one reminder at a time
__label__2 it is so stupid that i have to be coneccted to my calender and cant just create what i want to much work not worth it
__label__5 absolutely the best to do app out there great ui great features use it for general stuff shared shopping lists and household tasks projects everything well worth it for the paid version too the only features i'd like to see are more than once a day scheduling eg morning noon and night can workaround with multiple tasks and repeatable projects think recipes can workaround with templates but difficult
__label__5 this app is a great help for me this helps me enjoy productivity in whole new level i have been struggling for years to get my life back together but with this app i feel like i can finally get some work done in a fun and enjoyable way thank you very much
__label__5 pretty good
__label__1 the free version is crippled 3 lists max seriously just use dtg gtd to do app with free unlimited nested to do lists with tags and reminders
__label__1 why isn't this app getting downloaded there is some issue with the app it had been recommended to me by my buddy but this thing isn't getting installed on my phone
__label__5 helped me stay focused usually when i study i always have my phone around and i keep getting distracted by my phone twitter yt etc i have an upcoming exam this week and i decided to stay focus so i downloaded this app its great and it really works the first time i tried to give up i was so sad to kill a tree so i try to focus i really recommend this app especially for my fellow students also excuse my grammar because english is not my first language
__label__4 great app would love customizable notifications and icons that being said of course this is a hobby project just being wishful meant no offense i'd love to reach out it's always nice to get in touch with a fellow developer
__label__1 i have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly i am connected to the internet i am a premium user the app is great but please help me with my problem i'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error
__label__2 there's no automatic list of everything that is due today or past due wunderlist was better
__label__4 fabulous tool for task management by those organizationally challenged for five stars it would need to include a calendar function
__label__3 add ability to have a dark theme
__label__5 integrative calendar i've been using this for a few years now it combines multiple accounts syncs fast and the widgets are really flexible one suggestion to the devs is putting in an automatic do not disturb option so you can be certain your phone won't ring during an event
__label__2 setting am pm is not easy
__label__4 i really love this calender app its pretty overwhelming at first but give it a few tweaks and boom it wonderful my only complaint is that i can't add it to my family library please allow me to do this and i'll rasie my review to 5 5 stars overall i would recommend this
__label__4 overall good and useful i'll likely continue to use and i would like more control of reminder sounds including repeating so i don't miss it and sounds without needing to open app maybe there are settings i can adjust also more integration with other apps including trello and evernote and more a general multi app share feature would be great as is i am copying and reentering things in multiple apps and i want to just send them
__label__4 instead of just giving me a clock for practice give me an app for accountability something in which i can see my entire day at one place and i can manage accordingly make it simpler guys
__label__5 best app for calendars it's complete in almost every way possible made my calendar app for life because of the customization power you have
__label__3 it's great app very much helpful to focusing but now it's not as its stopped all the time from 2 days even for 15 min time and bcoz of this i didn't get any tree and from beginning i loss many trees which worth atleast 150 points which demotivated meso pls fix this problem
__label__3 reminders set to repeat daily don't repeat the only reason i wanted this app was to have ongoing daily reminder notifications so i will be uninstalling really liked the other features though
__label__2 the sorting option is not good there's no option to manually arrange individual tasks when you show completed tasks it all over the place completed tasks should be grouped together and displayed at the bottom of the list after the incomplete tasks it becomes very messy when completed and incomplete tasks are mixed together why tweak the app to make it worse than what it was before tweaking should making it better not worse
__label__4 great app reasanable pro features please add multibe avatars for the kids
__label__2 i was pretty pleased with the layout and the weekly view on the paid version but then i started encountering problems first of all i used fb to sign up and i logged out of the app and i can no longer sign in it stays loading indefinitely also on the weekly view it showed the incorrect name for the day and kept changing it it also changed notifications randomly
__label__4 this is a great planner app only thing missing is the ability to rotate into portrait or even rotate 180 degrees
__label__3 great app but unless you pay 48 year you can't type comments against your tasks
__label__4 simple and practical
__label__4 i really like it i think it's a really cool concept to have characters to build up with the habits only thing i wish were there is to be able to have notifications for term less habits
__label__5 very easy to use
__label__3 good app but some feature are to be updated still like it should actually calculate the petcentage of work done by us on each task and should be more attractive i think so
__label__3 just downloaded this app not sure what i think of it at the moment cant seem to find where you can use colours like the pictures
__label__3 it's good marginally better than the one that is standard with the phone
__label__5 love this app my favorite part is the helpful and intuitive snooze feature on tasks quick preset time ranges or ability to get specific make reminders easy to manage
__label__5 perfect for a busy bee i do a lot in a day this app helps me categorize my time on my busiest days by setting times dates and reminders for all my tasks that need to get done love it
__label__1 waste of time unhelpful and unmotivating
__label__4 does the basics clearly and easily i particularly like that it allows you to sort completed tasks in alphabetical order some other apps don't
__label__4 for me it takes a lot of additional actions to schedule a task and set the reminders even in free apps i can do it easier for one task i've left comments from mobile phone however i couldn't find then they were only in the web version of cource there are things that i like projects subtasks labels reminders by location and access from a mobile phone and a browser
__label__2 it does not stop you to open youtube so it's not that good for me
__label__1 expensive old and without any support also much better alternatives are available now
__label__3 this is a re review this could be the best habit tracker goal setter and task manager with some really great features like nested lists and smart auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup just don't confuse the 'game' in rpg for any actual gameplay but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system that deserves recognition allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life however do it now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups after a solid month of use building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks and setting up several habit based routines the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next while auto grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared once again losing the important ones in the clutter user defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series with no social aspect currently attached to the app as at ver 2 23 0 there is no task sharing there is also no designated pc mac linux front end for desktop syncing finally it's expensive as apps go a one off of 75 will get the full version or about 2 50 a month paid yearly which removes ads and gives calendar access original review a good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy it would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader
__label__5 tis' good
__label__1 i never give reviews i believe in if you don't have anything nice to say don't say it my issue is not with the app itself its the fact that i have been charge every single month for over a year i have reached out to the developer many times and nothing there is no subscription for me to cancel i am really over it with this
__label__4 good but have to pay for many of the features
"__label__5 fun free and heavily customizable if you are a gamer even in the casual sense this is the app for you 

 edit 2 1 2020 one problem to note is that there doesn't seem to be an easy way to renew overdue tasks by which i mean in other apps i can usually refresh them all with one click so that the tasks are due today would love an option for that since otherwise i have to go into each task and set it to be due today tt tt"
__label__3 pretty cool its features are much better than the previous version however the widget shows up too many google play apps pop up advertisements which is sometimes really irritating and takes my time for schedule planning i saw a review from the app developer maybe that problem could have been coming from other sources like my phone or google play app itselft or the like sorry for the comment that i have left even when i was not sure i thought that way because a lot of popups have ben shown when i was using this app sometimes gallery or photo app on my phone my phone is cheap but compact even sometimes show up ad maybe that could be the real cause of the problem
__label__3 please add location based reminders and missed call reminders
__label__3 it is simple to use ok for day to day use
__label__5 this saved me as i journeyed into my career of teaching so much to do and so little time this app kept me organised in my new chaotic life
__label__5 this is perfect i'm able to get all of my family calendars in one place without having to lug around a traditional agenda also they are wonderful at fixing any issues and responding to all emails
__label__5 perfect app
__label__2 too confusing
__label__3 the ui looks great love the dark theme problem is i downloaded this app because it was advertising watch compatibility in the pictures but the app is nowhere to be found on my galaxy watch active which was the only reason i chose this specific app
__label__2 initially app was working nicely but now since last 15 days its not working at all i tried its not opening at all i tried uninstalling and then restalling but same problem app is not opening at all
__label__2 great concept but can they hire an artist this artwork is outdated otherwise i would use this
__label__1 it only lets you use it linked with google calendar you can't have 2 separate things
__label__4 i've been wanting a habit tracker that is fun and this definitely is there are a few loading issues every so often if those bugs weren't there i'd give 5 stars all around though enjoyable easy to use and a great way to keep track of good and bad habits
__label__1 full screen ads in a calendar app are you serious
__label__1 terrible i'm not getting the pre alerts i set or the reminders themselves i go in to check on upcoming reminders see outdated ones in red that never alerted me
__label__5 i love this app so much very helpful for someone with adhd
__label__3 the time in the center of the widget most of the time does not get updated you have to open the app and then the widget is updated
__label__1 anything that calls itself a to do list that doesn't include a reminder unless you upgrade is useless uninstalled
"__label__3 i love this app and would give it a 5 star review except i can't get my 
dailies to reset after yesterday and that puts a major damper on my quests"
__label__5 awesome app
"__label__2 i paid for the subscription but can not use the recurring function i tried 
to make a task for monthly use and it does not show up on the other months 
ahead"
__label__4 app doesnt work without internet connection everything else is great
__label__3 sometimes gets dates wrong e g religious holidays not as intuitive as others ok for basic use
__label__3 great app needs a few things like task fail without consequences option mostly a full paid version without subscription or in app purchase not every one has everything connected to internet all the time
__label__4 would be perfect if i could organize the to do's by date they're random right now
__label__5 superb
__label__2 i couldn't restore any of my previous planted trees as the app got uninstalled due to an android technical problem very frustrating that i lost those records please advise how to restore the history
__label__2 the dailies and habits should reset everyday please let them reset
__label__5 great app
__label__2 there's no automatic list of everything that is due today or past due wunderlist was better
__label__2 i love ticktick and have returned after trying a few other task apps the problem is that it's all a it buggy emails sent to be added as tasks dissappear if sent automatically through gmail and my online web based tasks are different to those on the app maybe time to look again at other apps ticktick who should i email i'm also totally fed up as it no longer works with google assistant
__label__1 this app is not the best
__label__5 amazing this is the app i've needed haven't even dived into all the features yet
__label__2 it used to be a great app but since you took away ability to change delete a single event in a series of the recurring events it's not good for me any more
__label__5 one word to describe this app is amazing ultimate app for to do and habit tracking after many years a single app has impressed me so much highly recommended
__label__3 it works it just hard
__label__5 a great way for a visual person to outline and track their activities
__label__3 ok ilv
__label__3 good but i can't plant another type of trees i unlock trees but it can't be planted
__label__2 i would love it if my calendar would sync across by devices and my tasks notes synced its disappointing because i enjoy the simplicity of the format its user friendly but iy doesn't work for me since i can't sync all devices
__label__4 this app has been so helpful for me to be more productive as i didnt take care kf myself before i can't complain about anything except sometimes when i first log in for the day my dailies will be from yesterday and will take a minute to switch to today i would love to see why so and so points are being deducted when you take damage from missed dailies like clean medium 6 health or something like that i don't think i'll ever delete this app and i look forward to any updates
__label__4 fun and engaging way to track your goals and form better habits i'm still not great at keeping up with it but the app works well when i spend the time to pay attention to it
__label__3 cannot duplicate a list
__label__2 app is very buggy week view is completely unusable shows some events twice and some not at all also it would be nice if there was an option in month view to see the names of the events without having to click on every day individually fix this and you'll get 5 stars but without that especially week view the app is useless
__label__4 this app is awesome trust me it will keep you on track
__label__2 okay if you like planning with google it's exactly like that just prettier i don't see how this can replace a paper planner at all
__label__4 very nice app almost as good as apple would be nice if i could schedule task on calendar but great that i can have on phone and laptop dumped other apps that do more for this simple straight forward app that allows me to capture stream of consciousness things i need to do like reschedule doctor apt got rid of paper tablet on my desk in favor of this
__label__3 time zone doesn't work i have my phone in a different time zone than i live in and have managed to change most things to my home time zone this app allows me to change my time zone but it doesn't actually reflect the change anywhere the date and time of the app and events stay incorrect my phone is on taiwan time for now and i have set the app the preset for events and every individual event to mst but when i open the app or use the widget the dates show in taiwan time still
__label__4 it is goed better than i expected their windows app is bad but we all have a browser so that is not sometging bad
__label__1 horrific they have stopped supporting the application no replies application is not working as sync is not functional anymore please don't buy it it is a complete waste of money
__label__1 never responded to my original review in 2019 and the response to my latest review still doesn't answer the fact that any tasks that are recurring do not show in calendar even though you sync this information
__label__4 good
__label__5 superb daily time organizer
__label__4 this app is amazing i use it to show all my google calendar events as sectors on a 24 hour clock i just have one feedback i wish there was an option to divide the clock into two colored sector based on from when sunlight is available and when it's not the idea of ligh dark period seems more practical than the usual am pm or maybe provide a custom rotation to the dial for eg i would want the day to start from the time i go to bed and thanks for this great app highly recommended
__label__3 i like the app and it works to improve my productivity but the notifications almost never show up and the whitelist mode doesn't work sometimes i wish there was a way to change the ground color for the day week month and it's quite annoying that the flowers are as big as trees
__label__1 at first i really enjoyed this app but over time every update to the app has only served to break features make it more disorganized and never adding anything new of value just more problems
__label__5 increase very good
__label__5 really interesting apps
__label__2 reminders are kind of a core feature in a to do list app why should i have to pay for it the app is fine but i can't use the reminders
__label__5 i love it
__label__4 love this app so much it's helped me so much over th years to get university work and school work down but i do wish that trees didn't cost as much
__label__5 being able to sync shopping lists between various shoppers in one household is such a blessing keeps us from overspending
__label__1 infoo
__label__5 this is quite literally an app that has helped me organize not only my personal but professional life from planning out my work week and important projects to listing out groceries tasks never disappoints i've tried tons of different apps but i always seem to come back to tasks because it's so user friendly and has so much to offer on top of that customer support is amazing if i could give more than 5 stars i would
__label__5 the best scheduling app i've used so far easy to view at a glance and connects directly to your calendar no complaints
__label__1 widget has stopped working and the developer is unresponsive
__label__4 best personal assistant app
__label__3 being a free version user regularly i can boast about todoist's opening yield of tools you receive although they are not much different or more varied than most other task apps what makes todoist stand out is the easy to operate platform the simplicity mixed with the intuitive functionality makes this a hair more effective enjoyable my recommendation for anyone needing some help being more structured it helped me greatly
__label__3 looks great but reminders notifications are a premium feature google calendar is better
__label__4 this app is very helpful to me
__label__2 is there no way to assign a specific color to an event i like to group my meetings by color if i can't do that the app isn't useful for me
__label__3 suggestion can tasks take things from the inventory maybe some items can only be acquired through achievements and those items are needed to complete a task
__label__4 tried several of this type best of bunch for me after last upgrade widget date not automatically rolling over to next day
__label__5 free app works perfectly syncs everything
__label__2 would like to assign priority rating to each task a do it soon b do it later c low priority z take it off the list
__label__5 i love it after all those problems i had with my time i found this great app it let's me manage my time as well and its so easy to use
__label__3 suggestion can tasks take things from the inventory maybe some items can only be acquired through achievements and those items are needed to complete a task
__label__3 this is a good app for forming habits however it is missing important functions that you'll need for one this is primarily a countdown timer app it only counts down for a specified time it would be better if i could have a stopwatch feature i want to use this app for times i'm working out also the minimum time allowed is 10 minutes they should change this either way i uninstalled ads suck too
__label__1 the premium version is advertised at r32 per year but if you tap it it changes to r300 odd what's up with that
__label__5 the best cleanest most uncluttered to do list app thank you matt for sharing this
__label__1 unable to download it beyond 78 even as other apps download in a second
__label__1 i hate to say but ur app sucks it automatically stops and deletes a tree or seed score it hangs and even crashes so many times i can't even contact you for support i spend 600 s from 1146 s left with 546 which got automatically deducted to 200 i mean how on earth this is happening
__label__4 simple interface clear display not explored advanced features does the job for me
__label__4 it's a good app for task reminder but it still needs some thing more one needs to go into the menu to switch to the lists no matter which list has an upcoming task it should have option to show the mix of tasks from all lists in tiles widgets on app home interface i really like the snooze option quite straight away
__label__3 it helps tho but i can't access premium account even if i had enough load credits in my phone network
__label__3 they changed the priority colors so that instead of a gradient it now goes grey blue yellow red i don't think this is an improvement it is not immediately apparent to me which priority blue is at a glance they also took away the priority color strip on the left and replaced with a colored checkbox it looks worse to me i'm not sure this was necessary just so that the user could close out a task with a single click
__label__2 i'm not interested in subscriptions one time fee would be fine by me
__label__3 good but could be better it works well and is very similar to wunderlist however it's very annoying that the reminders disappear from the notification bar if you haven't completed your task in a day so you have to reschedule every day would be great if this could be fixed
__label__1 i hate it
__label__5 the only best time scheduler in play store
__label__3 it doesn't work i can still use my blacklisted apps while the tree is growing
__label__5 at last i get what i want thanks
__label__5 just installed and all of my events seamlessly transferred to this planner if i could give 100 stars i would
__label__3 excellent with a single exception i've used todoist for about 5 years and it's the best app in its class the free version outperforms other paid apps in my experience the one thing holding it back for me is the home screen widget on my phone it struggles to load lags is unresponsive won't select tasks properly the list may well go on in short there are so many things which sometimes break it rarely works this is fundamental 5 stars if fixed til then it's a reluctant 3
__label__3 i like this app and i bought premium even it was a little expensive 5 49 euro what i don't like is habits with a numeric value don't allow at least 0 times a day if you want to do something 6 times a week with the possibility to do it twice on one day it will stay undone the other days 1 tasks habits which are marked as undone may be send to the bottom too 1 whitout premium you only can scedule up to 7 habits after a removal of any named defect i will change my rating
__label__4 good place for storing tasks
__label__3 ok
__label__2 poor substitute for wunderlist which is going in may all imported well but nowhere near as many settings options and the list font size is far too big so u can only see a small portion of your list on the screen looking for anotjer alternative
__label__3 good great greatest very good nice decent adjusting
__label__1 tree withers and dies when using team mode all is fine in single mode refund premium please
__label__5 i have tried a lot of to do app's but not a single one has all these features in built reminders sub tasks support customizable moving of tasks in the list and most important sync across all devices like phone tablet etc even if some app has we have to buy premium to enjoy those features highly recommend this app
__label__1 its too complex
__label__5 i don't have this app for long but it is really easy to use so i like it it also allows you to skip a day if you can't do it that day just change the day
__label__3 please build ifftt integration so that any trigger can cause habit to be set as done up counted
__label__3 it could have been a robust app but these bunch of loosers want you to pay every month is annoying
__label__3 helps me stop touching my phone it helps me stop touching my phone however there is not much thrill in planting the tree you cannot select where the tree is going to grow and eventhough there are number of other trees it cost so much and earn so little from planting it makes it so boring it can get quite dissapointing
__label__4 useful
__label__5 you can list what you need to do and set up weekly monthly and daily tasks
__label__3 i love this app but the latest update is buggy and does not record when i check off tasks please fix
__label__4 love it bought premium but needs an option to schedule reoccurring tasks like take mom shopping first sunday of every month at 11am
__label__5 i've only been on the app for a small time and i can already see the ways in which it can help very inclusive and helpful
__label__1 i got just scam rs 200 for pro version nothing happened good times
__label__4 switch to 'to do' because wunderlist is being discontinued it is a lovely app easy to navigate interface however the function of 'today' smart list is not integrated in wunderlist this is the hat i was working from it would be great to see 'today' smart list again by the way my day smart list doesn't automatically pick up the day's tasks instead you have to add them
__label__3 the reminder option is not working i have paid for premium to use the app to its full potential but unfortunately the basic feature of the app to remind you to stick to your schedule with respect to habits you creat dosent work kindly help by resolving this issue color code options are limited that can be assigmed to the newly added habit
__label__3 guys excellent app bad financial model prepared to pay reluctant about subscription model unfortunately uninstall
__label__3 good app for setting daily tasks if it had hourly reminders alarms it would be great for me being notified by alarm makes up for it though as most just have short notification sounds that i never hear
__label__1 do not download this app if you want to keep money in your account they took an unauthorized almost 40 out of my account their help page says they offer refunds within 48 hours however they offer no access to claim a refund
__label__4 i use this to help me see what my day looks like the circular shape helps me related to easier i know and i have open spots and i know and i am busy it sinks with google so i don't have to import information multiple times really like it
__label__4 i've had this app for a while and i love it but after the last update it hasn't notified me that my time is up the tree is planted but my phone doesn't go off all the notifications it could have are turned on so i don't know why this is help please
__label__3 could be better on samsung s6 not showing reminders on screen have to open the same as a diary
__label__1 twice lost all data b c wouldn't sync had over a year of data had premium and still didn't make a difference moving on just done so upset
__label__3 felt very complicated when i am flying high
__label__3 fantastic idea i've actively been seeking something just like this for a long time but the app itself is super glitchy most things wont load and everything keeps resetting it might be my connection or my phone i'm not sure hoping i can figure it out cause i love this
__label__5 it's a good planner app
__label__3 nie ma możliwości ustawienia wyprzedzenia przypomnienia ani zwiększenia liczby przypomnień dla mnie to wada poza tym ok the application is basically ok but it is not possible to edit reminders i would like to be able to set several reminders for one event at different times in advance it would be good to have this option in the settings to set the default reminder advance
__label__2 no easy way to import export tasks in a compatible format e g google tasks
__label__3 it's a great app but i can not depends on it because sometimes it is not working well i have to refresh background task
__label__1 i have hope that this app will get a lot closer to the superior wunderlist so i'll change my review when it does but for now here are my biggest concerns i really don't like how 'my day' doesn't automatically include things due 'today' also when moving a task to a list it's annoying because the lists are not shown under their folders i'd also like to see a 'my week feature' also two lists can't have the same name even though i have them in different folders
__label__3 there were a lot less options for handwriting covers and stickers than i anticipated for something you want me to pay an annual or monthly subscription for it's a great concept but the execution fell short for me
__label__2 bad color scheme
__label__4 the app's a bit glitch y not gonna lie but it helps tremendously in my day to day life the community aspect of it is amazing i actually feel motivated by all the kind words good job developers my life's a bit less bleak now c
__label__2 the new design is atrocious before you could swipe left or right to see coinciding days which made for easy comparisons and changes you can't even scroll back up once the time has passed now its just one long continuous list takes 3 times as long to readjust just terrible 2 stars until a more usable design is reintroduced
__label__4 very user friendly
__label__3 it's listing the same tasks after some time even after its checked and completed in short it's listing the status of tasks
__label__5 good app
__label__1 very annoyed by the new time setting it's like going back to android 2 1
__label__5 an all in one app for todo lists remainders habit trackers and pomodoro timer and i haven't even bought the premium version yet
__label__1 shity app on top of that i subscribed for monthly and they charge me the while year and when i cancel my subscription no return policy my google reminder app is millions time better
__label__3 not sure bought the premium subscription for a year not sure though help pages are pretty good so i will keep working with this i like that it crosses my devices
__label__4 love the app was able to download it to my iphone i went to download it to my samsung tablet but once i hit open all i get is black screen i uninstalled the app and reinstalled it several times and it still won't work
__label__5 helps me keep track of my tasks and goals in an intuitive and easy to use interface
__label__4 this is a great app helps me a lot but i have 2 problems 1 the app doesn't give notifications on time when the time is up it used to give proper notifications before but for the past 2 weeks it doesn't sound on time 2 another problem is that i'm not getting the coins i earned sometimes when the notification doesn't come as described above i don't get any coins and the timer resets itself without awarding me my coins i request you to fix these 2 problems as soon as possible
__label__2 to complicated and let's you set things up only to then tell u it's not available
__label__3 i wish it wasn't conected to google callander which i don't like at all overall realy awesome concept wish i could use it if only it was a callander on its own
__label__1 not good
__label__1 absolutely terrible most unless app i have downloaded to date
__label__2 everything is under pro version
__label__3 it really helps in focusing but there is this premium thing so i cannot do many stuff i think you have to pay or get the premium thing to plant trees in real life but i like how there's this different kind of trees and stuff like it has music
__label__3 does the month view as per the professional design image exist this seems ideal but i csnt find it
__label__1 i was unable to understand anything this app is a big mess
__label__4 very useful reminders at specific times which stay on the screen really help me get stuff done would like to be able to create own catagories and choose colours and icons for these in the premium version thank you
__label__3 lobe this app but the only thing that is stopping me from getting premium is that i am unable to arrange the habits in order habits are also not arranged according to time and it makes it so hard to find them if you do fix it i will purchase this app
__label__3 is anything wrong with this app i do have to reinstall the app every day actually it is excellent but i am just about to give up with it i thought that was my phone but it happens only with this app could you guys please check what is going on i do appreciate it thank you thank you for tour reply it jist disappear from my cel regularly and i have to reinstall it again and again i use to move the app from the cel to the sd card i will try to follow your instructions thank you
__label__3 nice app will suggest some changes after some time
__label__3 any chance of getting a widget for the calendar
__label__1 i uninstalled the app and installed it again and now the app works but ive lost all my progress and my forest this is so dumb this app forces me to uninstall and then i dont even get my progress back
__label__3 pros i like the layout i like the ease of entering tasks i like the widget cons no check off when complete no accountability tracking it just didn't help at all with keeping me on task
__label__3 i found a way around this app i always do this and for the longest time forest was the app that kept me truly focused cause i dont want my trees dead but then i found out that if i remove the app from the background while a tree is planting i can use all phone features id still get the tree and coins by the end of the time i put now im just planting trees to gain coins so i can plant actual trees can this be fixed i really love the app
__label__3 i miss wunderlist don't like this app because i can't copy a tasks or project by copying to another section must write out in manually which is time consuming plus app doesn't let you cut and paste too cumbersome aloe and tedious wunderlist was 10x what this app is plus i couldn't move everything over sho lo'day tons of notes looking at evernote as a replacement
__label__1 shows annoying full screen ads that pop up from time to time
__label__3 i can't not choose another calendar besides google calendar to sync with app
__label__4 life changing app with a great concept but still needs some work
__label__2 app seems ok but they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar it let's you view the current week anything else and you have to pay so many free ones out there to choose from uninstalling
__label__2 please help relogging in after several months disuse it has asked me to enter a username and it's stuck on 'username taken' will not let me progress to the app i've tried every random letter number combination so it's definitely not taken just buggy app
__label__3 just changed phone didn't keep anything from my premium account can't even create a new account without erasing current data 2 for that inconvenience has helped me tremendously develop new habits ui is perfect the app and widgets allow quick and easy habit tracking counting habits are useful but it would be great to be able to see near misses in order to track improvement better customization of the interval chosen to calculate percentages would be very helpful
__label__4 great app reliable and useful however would be great if the kanban view was also available on mobile other than that i'm very satisfied with the app
__label__5 excellent app continuous improvements make app be in the top 1 of productivity category
__label__1 really frustating configuration
__label__4 it's pretty nice all things considered but i have found a few problems with it mostly the fact that the notifications do not work and by that i mean no matter how many notify alarms i set none of them go off i've downloaded this app on several occasions in the past and i've had the same problems each time the second is that the widget will quite often display that i have no tasks when i in fact have about seven on any given day i'm not taking a star off because of the widget though
__label__1 help forest team please note a genuinely helpful app if followed with honesty i've been using it for around a month have definitely improved with focusing but not a 5 star rating this evening the app crashed then did not open at all i even tried rebooting the phone trying to clear cache there was none etc and thus with no other option in order to continue using the app i had reinstall it edit update it keeps crashing i have to uninstall reinstall it almost everyday
__label__5 really useful
__label__3 the app itself is really great however if you are going to buy premium please make an account first then buy premium i bought premium without an account and was fine until i switched phones i couldn't buy premium again because the option had disappeared but i didn't have access to premium features i had even emailed support about the issue and gave the invoice number from google play store no response this is enough to make me not use the app again
__label__2 really liked this app until they started charging for basic functions on a monthly basis would have been happy with one time charge but not worth 36 a year when there is better for less
__label__5 works great
__label__5 best to do app i try very intuitive interface my day now is completely organized karma feature is very interesting and motivating thank you for this amazing app
__label__3 gets me moving when i get a reminder
__label__5 i love the app so much but i am really hoping that you guys dont get rid of your alarm feature in december because i love that feature so much and i dont want to have to get a new app that has the alarm feature and have to start all over again
__label__3 great app just can't justify spending 8 10 in order to track more than 5 habits when there are other apps out there i don't need to pay for to do so i'm switching to loop habit tracker can track as many habits as i want and back everything up all while being entirely free plus it's really nice
__label__1 it seems the app is not build for longer and more complex use it looks like it can be used for people that plan to follow and develop their behaviour but the level of this app is of a game takes too long for resolving the bugs and no reaction to feedback app crashes when using the calendar options this should not happend when using payed version of the app waiting for improvement or giving up using and paying for this app
__label__4 very nice app and easy to use
__label__4 easy to use and very flexible
__label__4 very good it is a bit complicated to use it should probably have a tutorial or an expailnation about the different functions as some of them just seem to be the same thing with just a differeent look i could just be stupid which is a possibility
__label__3 it's fairly easy to use however the alarm doesn't work
__label__4 love it some pay features are annoying
__label__3 really like this calendar app and would recommend to other users though it really does need sms support for sending automatic reminders to event attendees by that i mean i would like to be able to create an event and add an attendee when the event reminder comes round i would want the invited attendee to be sent a sms text message reminding them in advance of the event that functionality would make it a 5 star app for me
__label__5 es muy útil para mantener las aplicaciones del celular cerradas mientras trabajas
__label__2 i really like the application so far great interface and feature set i'd really like to see and would even do an inapp purchase for would be a much larger icon set i think being able to group characteristics and skills would be awesome too even better if the group can collapse it would also be cool to see a health bar that represents the amount of time you have in a day to be productive have it decrement as time passes and maybe make it adjustable for how much time you have in a day i think another tasklist app does that overall a great application i hope you continue working on this application edit the app is still decent but taking away the option to just remove ads for a one time price in favor of subscription only has made me decide to stop using this application and change my previous 5 star rating to a 2 star rating
__label__4 good
"__label__2 a core function missing is the ability to disable a routine daily 
occurrence for a specific day for example i usually exercise from 6pm to 
8pm every day so i created an event that happens every monday to friday 
today is a thursday and due to an unexpected occurrence i can't exercise 
today i wanted to change that my 6 8pm block of time just today but can 
only do so by deleting the event for every monday to thursday to clear my 
timeline makes no sense to clear that block of time and need to re create 
that exercise block for all the other monday to fridays if something 
unexpected happens at 6pm next friday i'll have to delete it alll and 
recreate all over again after just to clear my timeline if you get this 
core feature right then the app would be complete"
__label__2 looks like a copy of an iphone app im not impressed by the huge bar in the bottom or the single colored ui a night mode should come standard
__label__3 needs to have matching theme with phone i e dark mode with dark theme light mode with light theme
__label__4 it's best features are locked behind a paywall
__label__4 i suggest a positive running tab amd also a negative running tab i love the app and it really makes a difference in tracking my daily habits the only thing i have found that would make it better is if i could track relapses this would require it to allow something that i do not want to mark for a day amd when it is marked then it would be a negative this would help responsibility to be accounted for the relapse i would like these negstives to be separateky counted from the positive marks
__label__5 you win take my money i have been using this app for many years and never bought the upgrade i recently upgraded to the s10 and between bixby google and many planning apps i just couldn't separate myself from this one i simply have not found an app that's easier to add and complete tasks also the task widget is just hands down better than every other one out there so fine if you want to add fullscreen ads and have the audacity to include sound then take my money you can have it
__label__3 a new isdue has cropped up when editing a multiday event that you want to extend 1 more day you must include two additional days in order gor the app to show the one additional day you wish added most strange issue
__label__3 pretty cool its features are much better than the previous version however the widget shows up too many google play apps pop up advertisements which is sometimes really irritating and takes my time for schedule planning i saw a review from the app developer maybe that problem could have been coming from other sources like my phone or google play app itselft or the like sorry for the comment that i have left even when i was not sure i thought that way because a lot of popups have ben shown when i was using this app sometimes gallery or photo app on my phone my phone is cheap but compact even sometimes show up ad maybe that could be the real cause of the problem
__label__3 it was decent but i remember having to tap so many times just to get it to record your progress not very streamlined
__label__1 notifications are still premium feature okay
__label__3 dont have a microsoft account
__label__2 refreshing tasks is a nightmare
__label__1 can't use it without providing your email address immediate uninstall
__label__3 i wanted to buy the app but the subscription feature turned me down i wish there was a one time purchase option to unlock essential things like calendar unlimited inventory etc and the subscription for themes sounds and other cosmetic stuffs
__label__5 great app use it daily very useful
__label__1 i really wanted to love this app it does exactly what i need unfortunately it's riddled with bugs mostly with repeat tasks main one being if your phone is powered off at a reminder time it will break the reminder resetting the task brings more issues also takes 15min for the app to sync with the widget contacted priority support one reply a day seems to have no real interest in fixing the problems blamed it on nova launcher same thing happens with samsung launcher
__label__3 decent app would try premium but not going to pay yearly almost 50 for it offer a monthly plan and i might try it
__label__5 it's different from wunderlist but pretty close its like changing from gmail to outlook but it's working for me
__label__1 sync is broken we have been using for a year or so now sync between two people simply doesn't work microsoft have destroyed a great app what did you do it worked perfectly before
__label__3 bags lags usable but painful
"__label__2 beutiful and easy to use once you get used to it however i wished creating 
an event was a bit more simple and quick update no longer syncs to my 
calender and the dates are all messed up too bad i loved it"
__label__4 really good
__label__1 used to work ok now something is skrewy now if i restart my phone every single task comes up as a notification never mind of when the tasks were are due and the schedule i set now after i dismiss tasks they pop up again ignoring its schedule also wish app could remember which day the task is for if you have a daily task that you complete after midnight it thinks you completed it early and won't remind you later that day finally wish app opened to an overview of all lists
__label__4 i like the app very helpful for lots of things however i've lost my account twice i've had to uninstall it and recreate my account very good otherwise tho
__label__1 pretty disappointed that the first wall i hit is having to login or register i get the whole cloud saving thing but at least give me the option and let the risk fall on me for data loss the app looked promising and i was really impressed with the bit of pixel art i got to see however i'm not sure i want to sign up and allow access to my details or habits just yet
__label__3 yes at first attempt it look user friendly i am pleased good app
__label__3 why aren't holidays showing up on my calendar
__label__3 this deserves 5 stars but i am not able to see discussions since the last one week
__label__4 very good app for focus has helped me on more than one occasion i will say though the audio it plays if you choose to play it sometimes glitches out on my galaxy s9 it will sometimes just shut off and refuse to play even when my volume is on and the sound option is on otherwise though its a very good focus app great for people like me who get easily distracted by their phones
__label__2 not a power user with a massive calender of events so i don't need the full blown pro version but there are a lot of basic features under pro only no thanks
__label__3 its a cool app it really is but developers need to understand that a subscription based system is not for every app im fine paying a subscription fee to netflix or spotify because there is new content almost daily but i refuse to pay a subscription fee for a todo list app make a payed app ill buy it for 30 bucks what i wont is give you 3 bucks a month everymonth and add yet another subscription fee to my list
__label__1 developer started to add invasive ads and worst of all the functionality that was working before is not working anymore probably the app is busy with the invasive ad and forgot about the job at hand and yes i know about the payed version
__label__2 great concept but i didn't build up coins quickly enough and didn't get any gems meaning i couldn't get anything new for my character honestly a calendar and check mark system would give me more incentive than this
__label__2 please change the logo
__label__4 good to use
__label__1 after installing the app i check to see if my reacurring event would show up and it did that one time so minutes after i insalled i had to let it go
__label__4 please fix the alarm functionality it does not notify me in android 9 running asus zenfone max pro m1
__label__5 like it a lot easy to use easy to edit events great variety of views daily calendar for me
__label__4 loving this the only addition i would have is being able to view highlighted tasks and events on the calender
__label__1 not what i wanted wanted a timeline
__label__3 overall a really good app well thought however i would personally spend some time on the interface interactions it became too many steps for my preferences realizing i needed to change a bunch of tasks i had to pick a task bottom right to edit then tap below description untick termless select date click ok top right another ok top right that's too much i suggest adding swiping options to the task look at nine email as an example but overall good might return one day
__label__2 couldn't change time zone its an hour ahead and no setting to select my time zone
__label__1 only 9 lists allowed for the free edition incredibly expensive by app standards for the pro 37 per year i don't mind supporting a good product but that is ridiculous for a shopping and task list app
"__label__2 firstly this app often has been stopped i've tried to do something to fix 
it but failed then finally this app has been blocked by my phone so sad 
can't use it"
__label__3 notifications are great so far
__label__3 i'm an ui ux designer i use this app for 5 month i think it's great but hard to use
__label__4 this has been very helpful with tracking my habits for hopefully having remission with my fibromyalgia it sucks that there is only 5 habits you can put in but if you think about it 5 habits is more then enough to start trying to break go any more and you overwhelm yourself
__label__4 excellent app that not only has to do check lists but habit tracking also covered what i loved most about the app is the 'your thought' that pops after completing the habits genuinely thank you for such app creator
__label__2 it started strong then the ads were a bit much but it's free and i was thinking about buying it then events that are clearly on my google calendar stopped showing suddenly yes they re still on google and show on that app i don't like that app but i might be stuck with it i'm sorry this didn't last but i am glad the problem developed before i bought it
__label__1 i have been using the app from the last 3 years i am a premium user when trying to sign in a new device and sync it's not syncing i need my data please help with this issue even after reaching to the support team tonnes of times no one is responding so i am changing the rating from 3 to 1
__label__1 terrible i transferred all my lists from google to this app do they would all be in one place and they didn't save so beyond frustrating
__label__3 it is a great idea don't get me wrong but why the need for a chat room
__label__3 the app itself is very good nevertheless there's a problem i can't seem to make it work on my sony smartwatch 3 in fact as soon as i install the app on my phone the watch face appears on the watch but after a while about a minute it suddenly disappears
__label__4 very nice app it would be helpful if it is integrated with outlook calender or can be added to outlook calender just like evernote and wunderlist are connected to it
__label__3 very usable occasional technical freak outs some shortcomings in navigability and manageability
__label__5 best app for tracking habits could be better if it could be connected to the alarm and a better reminder system would have helped otherwise this app is really helpful tajnk you sooo much guys
__label__4 well
__label__4 habitbull is great i love how customizable it is for making different types of habits tracking my current streak is great for motivating me to keep on going and even if i break my streak i love that it shows my best score so i have a new goal to reach the only thing i would suggest is having a user suggestions button in the settings i have emailed about a new type of habit a couple times and have never heard anything back user feedback is always good for making a great app even better
__label__5 it makes your life easier
__label__5 this aponit the best i think it's great i love how you can set tasks and reminders
__label__5 very easy to use and extremely helpful for me to get organised for the day
__label__3 it's good but it's size is large
__label__3 hi im using the paid one on my phone and ipad however i find that they do not sync well on both like i already marked 3cups of water on my phone then whem i open on ipad it's not marked but then both updated according to the ipad how do i make this better also can there be a way to skip a habit sometimes i missed it and i dont want them to keep appearing on the list
__label__3 it's good but has some points to improve
__label__3 just started hence neutral stars i was going to write to the devs but i see you reply here open is good i don't know what a filtered list is that is my only confusion so far i was interested in premium but put off by the monthly fee rather than a single license meanwhile i was playing with the idea of selling each premium feature separately that would give you information about what your users want especially after you add computer support feed the wolf you want linux 1st
__label__3 pretty app and probably useful too i just don't like having to create calendar entries i thought tasks would be managed within the app
__label__1 i'd like to give it a 5 star very much the app is very useful convenient and easy to use and what's even better is that it allows the user to modify the alarm sound icon etc as we please that makes it much easier to organize our schedule but the app no longer works after i've changed my phone i don't know if the issue is about my phone i used mi a1 before and oppo currently or the app i've read about the configuration to get the app back to work but to no avail please help ty
__label__1 after signing in i get random notifications telling me things i absolutely do not care about i haven't even added any tasks and it's already telling me to join groups and blah blah blah no thank you
__label__4 this app has really helped me get my stuff in order it also has an active community and good challenges it is a bit glitchy at times things don't refresh etc but overall it's great edit lol the 'report a bug' is glitched on my phone p i had to manually send my info over in the middle of fixing a glitch where my day won't reset been broken for a week
__label__3 this habit tracker is fairly good in its own right but there are ways it can be improved a lot perhaps it can be more specific perhaps it can become more addictive with certain rewards for teaching certain goals
__label__3 it was working well but after sometime it was experiencing crashes and won't open really disappointed but still i am downloading it again hope it'll not do the same
__label__5 good app for helping me organize daily tasks
__label__4 i like this app it's very useful
__label__3 i prefer the browser version over the app version it's hard to find all the options in the app version the app and browser also don't sync well and one time i lost all of my health and money upon opening my app version for the first time in a long while even though i had used the browser version earlier
__label__3 overall it's pretty darn good the only problem i have with the app right now is that the crown doesn't work for scrolling please integrate this simple feature for five stars
__label__3 great
__label__1 needs to access data on device events can't be entered manually
__label__4 it is a good for organising daily task n making habit
__label__3 bought the planner pro love the app the down side is that the app did not sync i have 2 device handphone and tablet both android i have to update both device twice instead of once would give 4 or 5 star if it can sync between both device i have some suggestion maybe can input some bill tracker and some cute icon or pill tracker hydration icon
__label__3 have to push too many buttons to approve my route not hands free friendly
__label__2 i paid for the pro version because the color coding in the free version didn't work properly come to find out that the pro version doesn't have daily tabs for tasks and notes as the free version does but the paid version does color code gaining that feature isn't worth losing the other two i feel robbed
__label__1 i have purchased pro version i plant a tree for an hour and come after an hour to see the forest destroyed it has happened more than 3 times i even left the phone on the app itself kindly fix this when you don't get to see the reward after 3 hours of productive time it really gets irritating and makes me think why did i even purchase this app kindly help
__label__1 i cant uninstall this completely there is this package installer uninstalling forest for days and still running i am using samsung s8 if that helps
__label__5 i've only been on the app for a small time and i can already see the ways in which it can help very inclusive and helpful
__label__1 this app launches itself with an invisible overlay over my home screen that is extremely suspect behavior and therefore uninstalling
__label__3 it's a great app and has definitely helped me maintain my habits i had been gifted premium early on but i've found that the features have disappeared and i'm only seeing the base version i like it enough that i want to buy it but i worry about whether it will keep the features based on my experience and other reviews i've also found a bug when i have a goal set to 3x a week as success the app doesn't recognize when i've had a successful streak and always shows as 0 successes in the streak section whereas it's at 80 in the percent success section and many weeks of meeting my goal
__label__4 this is my favorite daily schedule app it is so simple to use and super versatile i paid for the pro version just so i could do everything and it was well worth it
__label__5 great app love it
__label__4 this app is very helpful for me to cut back from phubing and spend time staying focused for as long as i wish there's only the problem of the crashing of this app oftentimes please do fix it and thank you
__label__1 installed looked like what i was looking for loved the design but the app makes me use the standard alarms and calander of my phone to put every bit of planning in and i hate the calendar on my phone thats why i came here to bad
__label__3 app is okay but ba can still enhance this app by adding more features to make it more user friendly for example allow the user to drag and drop tasks to their desired schedule or list
__label__3 well i like the app and it truly helps me stay focused combined with some time restriction methods it's good although those ones are short times plus breaks achievements are boring and not good enough they try to make you pay for extra but the app itself is not exciting enough to pay the achievements are not really worth it and it's hard to unlock new trees even with pro version no new campaigns are launched collecting coins is not an easily achievable task too hard to get new trees
__label__5 nice app good layout and design one request add tracking as well to the tasks then it will be complete solution along with setting up tasks i need to track as well which tasks i have done today weekwise and monthwise
__label__3 i lost all my pictures that i had attached in wunderlist
__label__4 habitnow is the first todo list with a key feature i've been looking for to do items that are automatically created at certain times as such it is the best such app i've ever used the only problem is that the author made no provision for hiding completed items they just hang around cluttering the list the best it does is move them to the bottom i find it very odd that anyone would want to stare at completed to do items certainly that shouldn't be the default but there it is
__label__3 i found this app to be redundant since i already have a calendar on my phone and planner pro does little else
__label__5 this app has been more entertaining than i even expected i have been looking for a productivity app that i will stick with and this is the one
__label__1 this is worst task game in my life
__label__5 very nice app and i think it will help you with your routine
__label__3 forced to migrate i'm annoyed that you can't drag and arrange tasks manually if sort by is on i need to be able to arrange tomorrow's tasks in the order i want to do them not whatever order the app decides
__label__3 cool app
__label__3 needs to give you the option of adding pictures when note taking if it had this option would be excellent otherwise not a bad app
__label__4 very useful calendar for people in business and even for busy individuals
__label__1 for what i needed it wasn't good enough i was going to have to buy the pro version to truly enjoy it too bad had a lot of potential
__label__4 good app
__label__3 needs a widget once it has multiple different widgets calendar to do list grocery list etc i might revisit it
__label__2 sharing didn't work there's a permanent notification and everything is premium option even the theme
__label__3 not bad i liked it
__label__1 i have had this app for 2 years and absolutely loved it after an update it would cut on automatically and freeze my phone i would have to hit the open apps and close it before i could do anything with my phone i have emailed and explained what it was doing and i get am email wanting more explanation so i did several days later i get an email that wants a video showing i don't think this will get fixed i paid for the pro version and i will not renew
__label__3 vibrates even in silent mode without vibrations even on 485
__label__4 so far so good simple and functional would like an easy way to quickly move items from one list to another as i shift things from a general todo list to a today list each morning clear clean and ad free love it
__label__2 i'm going to start by saying who segments their hours on a clock into fifths that's not standard and just annoying second why can't i add events from the app it always redirects to google calendar so what is this app even good for i'll just use my calendar and it will be easier
__label__3 hi i like this app it could be better if the todo list's tasks were sorted by their deadline and also today's tasks had a different color and a reward could be a game which needs some coins to play them thank you
__label__3 it just opens a calender so i'm not sure why i need something between me and my regular calendar app
__label__3 has a lot of potential
__label__5 this is exactly what i needed the customizations are really in depth and very helpful i opted for the 2 99 mo subscription and so far it's already worth it it's like a better version of google calendar look at your daily routine and upcoming tasks at a glance it's super intuitive within a half hour i set up my daily routine and upcoming events with absolutely no problems at all if you're a busy person and need a way to organize your life this is the app you need
__label__4 money hungry devs want about 5 mo for simple features that's about 60 year for the fully functional organizer app other than that it seems nice so far
__label__5 amazing app to take notes and make to do lists
__label__3 widget stuck after some time and not updating according to app untill we lauch app why plz fix it
__label__1 you need internet access and the server has to be up on their side for you to be able to access your to do list server has been down today and i cant check off or edit my to do list due to that going to be deleting this app most other to do lists work offline
__label__3 good
__label__5 so useful
__label__3 i like this app but despite all attempts following your steps the notification is still not working it used to work just fine but for some reason i'm guessing after an update it will not notify me that the time is up until i press my phone's powers button meaning i am having to come back to my phone every so often to check if my time is up which contradicts this apps purpose i'm sometimes going 20 minutes over time so much for pomadoro please fix this issue
__label__3 i'm constantly finding little glitches in the game that throw off what i am trying to do when i am trying to earn points thank goodness for husband and siblings who have played this enough to know how to fix things when they go buggy but i don't appreciate not being able to go to customer service or send a quick email to help them update the system and fix it
__label__5 i really enjoy this app it's a fun satisfying way to keep track of time and stay off my phone for a while
__label__1 this app is terrible compared to wunderlist especially if you like the functionality to share a list with another we cannot seem to get the shareable feature to work additionally even though i'm logged in with the same account on my laptop and phone it doesn't sync lists new items are added to the bottom of a list instead of the top microsoft has a lot of work to do to get this where it needs to be
__label__4 great app
__label__5 especially like that there is a widget option where you can put your tasks on your home screen and be reminded of the tasks you set very dynamic app yet simple is appearance and interface helpful and not over the top
__label__1 couldn't edit any habit in this apps can't add pages episodes and liters bec they're not available in the edit menu the only way to edit a habit is to delete it
__label__5 one of the simplest yet best app for time management hardworking people must give it a try
__label__5 loving it would appreciate dark mode as well
__label__4 really just started using this app seems pretty good but way early days to rate beyond 4 even if it does deserve it
__label__1 i dont understand anything it's super complicated
__label__3 it would be great if didn't cost 28 00
__label__3 decent simple just a bit too simple for me i thought the percentages counted for task progress s though it were a whole project unfortunately it seems to only relate to habits i'd like to see subtasks and then percentage competed at least the habit statistics are clear and aesthetically pleasing
__label__3 i just started using this app my week actually starts with saturdays while only sundays and mondays are mentioned if you could modify this detail that'd be really appreciated
__label__5 my favorite planner
__label__3 passive but good
"__label__3 initially i gave it 4 stars but after using it worked great based on how it 
was created but lacked important features like offline functionality on 
mobile sorting your todo list by date and calendar syncing overall if 
you're not very particular about these it works great in gamifying habits"
__label__1 very poor customer support despite being a paid subscriber strongly recommend against this app not able to sync across devices and there was no response despite sending mails
__label__2 i don't care for it when i first opened it it showed me all these appointments i was thinking what the heck then i figured out it was showing me weeks passed along with the current to me that's just a bunch of clutter then it was telling me i had five appointments this month no only have one it only showed the one but it still says 5 i don't have a clue what the other four are anytime i try to do anyting it practically begged me to join premium i just uninstalled it
__label__4 of all the planner apps i've used this has been the best one i really love the widget a few extras i wish i had but for the free version not bad the biggest thing that bugs me is the force use of military time in the widget
__label__1 this app claimed it was syncing to the cloud when i lost everything on my phone and had to reinstall it signed in and tried to sync there was nothing i have an open support case that nobody at habitbull has responded to 900271 do not trust this app or whether it will backup your habit tracking data terrible customer service and fail of an app
__label__1 dude don't we all want people to pay us for everything we come up with xxxxxxx hi thanks for the attentive reply though this app was not worth the payment or storage space for me i did find one that works nicely looking forward to more replies hopefully relevant or none at all
__label__3 please make the android navigation bar match the app the area with the back home recents buttons on non samsung phones
__label__3 i've been using this happily for years but i have realised that it desperately needs ical feeds functionality to make it perfect i need to see personal and work calendars and an university provided ical feed all in the same place
__label__3 its a nice app liked the design also no option to copy paste same schedule to next day
__label__1 cannot log in on other devices
__label__3 i liked the app and it looked like it had a good set of features but i didn't like the 4 99 year recurring subscription fee
__label__5 this really helped me hone my time management skills while at home and helped me to stick to a daily routine wonderful i love the video game aspect of it so interesting brings back childhood memories
__label__5 i love this app it's very cool i'm having fun with it
__label__4 i like this app and it's really helped but now i can't open it anymore it crashes while loading every time i've tried troubleshooting restarting deleting the cache but nothing seems to work
__label__3 is there no way to have weekly rasks but only week days other apps have this option
__label__5 i really like the planner it helps me achieve my tasks goals have an avenue to scribe my ideas down double thumbs up
__label__1 very poor customer support despite being a paid subscriber strongly recommend against this app not able to sync across devices and there was no response despite sending mails
__label__5 it's a nice app
__label__4 i love it simple and effective is it right that the motivational pics don't switch anymore mine has been stuck on the very same for a year now
__label__4 fun way to keep away from your phone
__label__1 newest update nerfs the widget so you can't utilize as much functionality to it the main app also features the annoying swipe to select feature now the previous click to select was fine and this new change doesn't add anything only creates a new barrier of frustration
__label__3 i can't figure out how to make it work on my s2 watch there are no clear instructions
__label__3 is there a way to get my money back i don't like this app as much as a few others i have
__label__4 love this app didn't think i could find something as good as wunderlist but this app is better just a couple of things would make it perfect option to change font size and option to add new items to top of list
__label__1 this used to be a very good calendar app with plenty of good features in the free version already unfortunately they introduced intrusive full screen ads recently to force you into buying the premium version i'll rather switch to another calendar app than be blackmailed like that
__label__5 i've found this app really useful for assisting my success in various areas sometimes stopping certain poor habits and sometimes starting positive new ones
__label__5 awesome was using wunderlist but they are going away i tried a few others they are all so similar now but this one seems like it will be here for the long haul judging by the number of downloads also it is as simple as wunderlist i did have to pay 29 and waunderlist was free for the most important functions so that was different but after using the app for a week i'm sold not a better app out there for my purposes kiss keep it simple stupid and this app does that
__label__1 path profile name is required glitch when trying to make avatar on galaxy s10
__label__3 cool application
__label__4 very helpful
__label__5 i love it's fun and also it makes me want to focus more that's a pity i can't buy the premium version because my country is under sanctions
__label__5 this app is actually really handy it really keeps me motivated i would highly reccomend this app to anyone that has trouble staying organized
__label__5 the best scheduling app i've used so far easy to view at a glance and connects directly to your calendar no complaints
__label__2 i much preferred wunderlist could easily copy items to new or existing folders was much more versatile why do it techies have to move 3 steps back each time something new is launched surely r d of products they wish to replace should have shown functionality used
__label__3 no sound in reminders just vibration how can i fix it
__label__1 i would use the app but it's a paid app and i'm not sure of its true value because i haven't used it how is it better than keep or others that are for lack of a better description free
__label__5 this is a superb way to motivate yourself to do things to create new and healthy fun habits and get rid of bad habits do you want to live a life full of adventures be creative and install this amazing app i would suggest a clearer and friendlier gui but overall its amazing
__label__4 great app and it really helps me stay on top of things though i do wish i could be able to put events in too for example friends birthday from maybe 10 am to 2 pm and things like that
__label__3 nice but there seems to be no way to hide declined events that makes it much less useful would give 5 5 otherwise
__label__2 i'm probably too old for this couldn't find the energy patience to work out how it works and why was it preset with meditation i guess it would seem obvious to someone who uses technology more bought a huge paper planner called trigg instead less portable but it won't crash malfunction or lost if i break my phone
__label__1 i would give 5 if bug is fixed it automatically opens showing black and unresponsive app pop up when it is not actually opened please fix this is for samsung s10e
__label__3 cannot share lists send invitations from both directions to lists imported from wunderlist on both sides get unavailable list
__label__1 was good but has recently been persistently bugging me for add'l permissions including to my google account uninstalled it
__label__3 overall the app does what it's supposed to do but a few quality of life features would go a long way for one a list for later this week would be nice as would the ability to nest lists more than one deep however the achilles' heel of the system is definitely its sync syncing frequently fails or takes forever and is often too slow between devices to make the most of the other capabilities of the app honestly if a better option came out i'd jump ship in a heartbeat
__label__1 this is a great planner but i'm really annoyed that having previously paid for the pro version i am now expected to pay an annual fee
__label__5 this has replaced my paper planner and i am addicted to it the most amazing app and product ever
__label__1 my entire plan was suddenly removed
__label__5 super easy to use great widget keeps lists clean love it
__label__1 don't go for premium then you have to make sure the data sync is upto date everytime before you start the app and it is not possible unless you have good speed wifi wherever you go
__label__3 i don't friggin know yet i just installed it note i haven't spent any time on it
__label__4 simple and straightforward
__label__1 too complicated and time consuming to set a task no way to repeat on a monthly basis and specific day of the week at the same time not worth the time it takes to use it uninstalling
__label__2 requires an account
__label__3 kinda complicated still not used to it i love the widgets though
__label__1 it will ruin your plan you are going to waste your time customizing it downloading this app will increase your screen time and degrade your efficiency
__label__1 now down to 1 star for the unappreciated bilingual holiday settings for bc canada absolutely no need for this the phone and app setting where the language is set to english should override any other situation i didn't get a satisfactory answer from the dev i'll keep deducting stars as long as the app doesn't improve update feb 2018 1 star for the completely uncaring attitude re french in the holidays that i have no way to get rid of my 1 star won't change until you do no change
__label__5 this app works really well it let's me organize my tasks reminds me when they're due with the ability to give me the option of reminding me early much like the calendar on my phone i just like having this app as a backup reminder so i don't screw up forget them which i seem to be able to do occasionally anyway since i've yet to find any bugs i highly recommend this app
__label__5 it's an amazing app does what it promises easy to use and a cool feature is it pushes due tasks to the next day which helps a lot
__label__2 trying to set a reoccurring daily task is so convoluted that it requires reading a lengthy help article i've switched to google tasks which is way more intuitive
__label__2 i had hope for this calendar app but apparently in order to see the calendar in a normal format as to the list format you have to pay a premium that is not what i want to do i'm very disappointed uninstalling will be looking for another calendar app all in all it seams like a good calender app but just not for me
__label__4 the app is allready great the amount of customisation is surreal and with a bit of tweaking you can really make it work the sentimental value you create this way really helped me grow as the app is rpg themed those elements could be further enhanced imo i think a customisable character would be fun more options to spend the currency other then personalised awards is what im getting at this way you really build something with the effort you've put in for the games keep up the good work
__label__3 for 4 99 to 9 99 i'd like more widgets and customization as it stands the main widget list is block white
__label__3 great app but tried backing up and restoring for a new phone and got a version mismatch error with no option to convert it no mention of this beforr backing up disappointing
__label__2 anything with a dash creates an alert which is troublesome to remove eg practice weeks 1 3 turns into a due date of january 3rd
__label__5 this app is great it keeps me on track with things i need to do works great for me and i dont have any major problems at all
__label__4 good
__label__3 paid for it 2 times keeps wanting me to pay for it again
__label__3 it hangs in my phone doesn't work cant understand what the hell is happening with this app after using more than 2times fix it plz
__label__5 at the moment i'm using free version and it's suit my needs i've never rated apps before so i think it's good mark
__label__4 some reason just recently the app uninstalled itself or somehow or another it got uninstalled and i haven't been able to receive any updates or any calendar events for the last couple weeks
__label__1 facebook login fails with an error from facebook saying the login method hasn't bee implemented correctly
__label__3 it takes a lot of menus and selections to add anything to your list
__label__5 good simple and effective
__label__1 doesn't even have a repeat feature
__label__2 too complicated i spent a half hour looking at the guide trying to figure it out created new characteristics and tasks but on the home page there's no drop down to choose a task when i saw i'd have to create one every time i decided to uninstall suggestion create tutorial no one has time for the long guide if we did we wouldn't need a productivity app
__label__1 rescheduling tasks is simply randomly not working rescheduling something for today can make task dissapear earlier i have experienced that it duplicated tasks this way a basic functionality is broken and i just lost what should i follow up today no activity log available as that is a paid feature i guess i will never try that now
__label__1 to me its not user friendly i dont like the question up front before a tour of the app its very limited unless you pay for the pro version i think when picking a routine or something a bar or something should pop up with options or ideas to choose from
__label__5 very organized simple just what i was looking for in order to keep my daily tasks organized
__label__1 app has too many error to count
__label__1 don't bother with this planner app there are lots of other apps that do the same thing this app has intrusive ads thats pop up at random if you close the app and open a different app planner pro will open a pop up on the new app your using seriously don't even bother with this bs
__label__3 amazing app
__label__3 something that bothered with the calendar widget is that tasks that span for multiple days are separated into blocks in contrast to a continuous line
__label__3 need google voice integration service to add task
__label__3 it doesn't work well for repeated scheduling of regular tasks i have tried selecting every week or every 7 days and repeat either does not work at all or shows up only for the same day monthly not weekly
__label__5 first class calendar
__label__4 nice app 4 stars for interface somewhere overmuch filled with great variety of little numbers quotes and other things which sometimes could cause eyes bleeding as an evident consequence of an attempt to find out what for they are here
__label__4 great app would have been a 5 if had more color options
__label__2 i could not figure out how to set reminders and i did not want to register
__label__2 great app for your phone but if you need smartwatch functionality look to any do rather than this app in dialogues with the devs theyve stated they have no intentions of integrating even simple wearos apps like add task from watch uninstalled
__label__2 one day i kinda broke my tree and after that it told that if you want your tree to remain nice watch a viedo
__label__1 i couldn't even sign with android it kept saying the password is wrong i ended up changing the password and still didn't login wasted an hour
__label__3 no feedback and i want to arrange the tasks according to their priorities in the home screen widget and i want to repeat some tasks weekly
__label__3 im facing an issue please i have subscribed to your pro version and paid money google play unfortunately im still an free user the money debited from the bank can you please help me
__label__4 excellent app that not only has to do check lists but habit tracking also covered what i loved most about the app is the 'your thought' that pops after completing the habits genuinely thank you for such app creator
__label__2 been using for years just about to delete due to the full screen lengthy ads that not only appear when i add an event they pop up when i'm using other apps did a scan using an ad detector app and business calender is the culprit shame as pervious ad style was ok this is ridiculous though
__label__3 i have noticed when i write notes and leave the app to find out more info the app locks which is fine but what i have written before i leave the app is not saved which can be very annoying there isnt even a warning or option to save before you leave the app
__label__3 really like this app keeps crashing fix that 5
__label__5 love it
__label__3 can we please have sub tasks placed under our main task the analytics are not so useful to be honest
__label__3 the app is good but a faq would be appreciated for example i cannot find out how to create a group for my tasks
__label__3 it's very useful so far however i'm not sure if you can change your daily routine i made one for monday and it auto filled for every single day of the week whereas i need them different and when i go to try and add a new task to my day that i want it changes it for all of them disappointing and useless if theres no way to bypass that might as well go back to pen and paper
__label__1 does not log in after 5 minites it's still trying to log itself in
__label__3 really great app but it sucks that you have to get premium to get the most basic feature notifications for a timed reminder
__label__2 this app was fantastic when i first downloaded however now my monthly recurring task pops up evey day no idea why when it wasn't doing that before i've tried deleting and adding again but it does the same thing really annoying
__label__5 realistic approach on time management
__label__4 i love it simple and effective is it right that the motivational pics don't switch anymore mine has been stuck on the very same for a year now
__label__1 your app doesn't work properly i can do whatever i want while my trees grow and they won't die when i re enter the app there's just a message that say if you use other app you have to kill your tree first for now is totally useless i have also bought the app and since i've done that i can't even double the money i earn please fix these problems
__label__3 im giving it 3 stars it deserves 5 stars for the app but getting 3 cause after i bought some gems there were some shady withdrawals which means the privacy protection for my card was breached and im 99 sure its from habitica cause this happened right after the purchase please increase your cyber security for card transactions
__label__2 better than google calendar but has bugs for example it keeps restoring deleted events after i delete them i cleared cache memo and restarted phone useless still the same banana update yes i did remove gmail account but no use it seems a bug between localhost and oppo accounts as it shows both colors for the same birthday btw i tested removing oppo account or localhost then i get a bug free part of the calendar but it bugs again after that part update yes 2 entries but for a certain period
__label__5 it's honestly very useful when studying or working by myself it keeps me accountable for how much work i get done whenever i'm working and i don't like what i'm doing or it's hard or i cant focus or whatever i always try to distract myself from my phone so this is helpful 10 10 also the little trees are cute i like to do a lot of short times so i can build up a forest instead of just one big tree
__label__5 i really like it it is easy to use it doesn't take a lot of time just check and follow your new habits me encanta fácil de usar y no toma mucho tiempo revisar y hacerle seguimiento a tus nuevos hábitos
__label__5 wonderful reminder app and brilliant community
__label__3 felt more like i was wasting time instead of getting something done
__label__1 no pomo time more than 1hr no whitelist available no feature for tracking task progress also add the feature to quit bad habits
__label__5 this app is super helpful 10 10
__label__4 i love this app what i liked is the alarm feature for individual list items
__label__3 needs to have feature where you add the next item to the top of the list not the bottom widget version
__label__2 there is a bug of my forest when i use home botton the picture back to homepage and i still can use my phone
__label__1 i cannot log in my microsoft account the app shows a message your password is not correct but i can log in my account using the pc version of the app how to solve this problem
__label__1 simpel in het gebruik mooie lay out snel handige opties voor het opnieuw gebruiken van ingevoerde gegevens werkt perfect samen met google calender contacts en taken
__label__1 just purchased monthly subscription until now my app is not working as a full version
__label__3 unfortunately the free version does not provide enough functionality for me i am trying to track habits but it stopped me at 7
__label__3 a decent to do list app except for the ads i understand ads are necessary and accept that but forced full screen ads with sound that even when they are done don't let you close them and force you to the play store if you back up out of the play store the ad starts all over again
__label__2 i found the white text against many of the colors very difficult to read
__label__5 this is what i was looking for thanks guys
__label__3 useless unless it gets updated so we can use it offline as well the best time i have for updating it is en route to from uni and i can't do that without internet otherwise it would have been a bomb app
__label__2 came over from wunderlist and i was not happy with the changes i have sync errors all the time my lists are doubbled up the ones i had shared with others and when i add a new task to any list they go to the bottom at the list so i have to manualy drag them uppwards and if i change it so that it goes to the top of the list the app wont let you drag organise the list this app is just bugs bugs and glitches so in short make it more like wunderlist but ok app otherwise
__label__3 nice app but requires payment for basic features
__label__1 this program does not work period installed opened just sits there at the start screen frozen and does nothing no available controls or menu nothing do not use it there is nothing to use
__label__5 very good app i loved it like anything
__label__3 could you please add the option to repeat the tasks
__label__5 great app love everything about it especially the multi select option would love to see the task tool bar at the bottom rather than the top it would make one hand operation a lot easier
__label__5 does everything you need when you have a task top of mind throw it in anydo
__label__5
__label__4 i'm using this app for all my recurring reminders that i need to remember that i don't actually want on my to do list like fill up water bottle remind kids to pack their lunches etc i've tried several apps the reason i've settled on this one for those reminders is b c it will give me a reminder notification every time whether or not i completed it last time i love that you can select specific days of the week not just weekly or daily my biggest concern is it not having cloud backup
__label__4 love the design although the rolling 12 hours takes some getting used to very helpful for me to be aware of how much time i have available before an event
__label__2 not backup in device offline
__label__1 they claimed they would give me my money back but didn't so i had to go through my bank i'm talking about 2 99 it's not a free app to get full functionality so you end up paying extra it's not useful for my purposes at all i was hoping it would sync with google contacts the alarm is way too loud and i don't understand how to use it they deliberately give you the runaround acting as if they're going to pay you back but they don't
__label__3 nice app
__label__2 worst
__label__3 i like this app a lot it is refreshing but to be 5 stars i should have more flexibility in setting intervals like selecting days of the week so i can have work and nonwork day schedules that easily repeat when i add something to a schedule a 10min before alarm should not be default i'm using the app to plan my day primarily finally each new entry should default its begin time to the last entry's end time with the new end time shortly after say 30 min later that would be a 5 star app
__label__5 i like it
__label__4 everything is good only one feature shall be add we should be able to customise reminder notification tone
__label__3 works great easy to move unfinished tasks why the 3 because they want 3 dollars a month to review completed tasks there are others out there that don't charge
__label__4 it is very good app to manage your to do list one thing that can make it better is it should show all the incomplete or overdue taks with todays tasks as overdue instead of into inbox this will make those task more accessible and will keep them under notice
__label__3 hi the range of the nuce coloured sectors does not cover the time interval of my events it had been the best reason why i chose this app to have an easy straightforward overview of my plans why doesn't ut work as it is shown on the pictures
__label__3 i really like the concept but the app widget doesn't recognise 'reminders' only 'events' if my day was organised hour by hour with events then this would be ideal but i rarely have more than 2 events per half day reminders i use all the time if the widget recognised those then it would be far more useful to me would still recommend despite this
__label__5 this app has helped me keep up so many habits and routines at first i struggled with it a lot but i soon joined a party the quests are really helpful to keep me on track and there are others in the groups to help out too
__label__3 wish microsoft could copy wunderlist features properly before killing it i am already missing wunderlist
__label__5 the best mobile business calendar ever
__label__1 not good wasted time
__label__5 a nice application with a interface designed to have the ability to give you a reminder heads up for coming events it seamlessly absorbed info from my calander alarm clock and prayers salah reminder keep up the good work
__label__3 this app and todoist web are nice products but they do have their issues 1 it's hard to know what to expect from todoist in the future updates and fixes take a very long time and there is no public roadmap or issue request voting system 2 todoist promotes itself as great for the gtd method but it lacks core concepts like next actions waiting for and reviews 3 the app refuses to start if you don't like google services gsf on your phone
__label__2 doubles and triples all my appointments in my calendar making it hard to manage
__label__1 premium support has not contacted me for 3 days and counting
__label__3 how to view the app on laptop just like wunderlist
__label__4 i was so pleased with the new habit tracker as well as using a true dark mode however i don't agree with the premium policy as i prefer to make a bigger one time payment such as when i bought final cut pro x with apple instead of a small recurring subscription that makes me want to go back to todoist it's a damn shame as i liked ticktick so much i'm willing to pay for premium unfortunately the subscription policy is an easy deal breaker
__label__3 it might be great if i can join online room by not type a code maybe i can found a new friend who has focus time like me
__label__3 great app but missing integration with goggle assistant or automatuon apps like ifttt many apps do this now ticktick is falling behind
__label__3 wish i could track more than 5 habits without paying
__label__3 new user experience just logged in pretty simple started a list saw that you could categorize them as personal or work since i had typed all my tasks in the same place first experience landing i tried to move some of these tasks to the work section couldn't i can't tag them either i have to retype the whole thing bummer
__label__4 like all the other users of wunderlist i had no choice but to switch it took time to figure out how to be able to create lists without having to have due dates reminders shut them off in settings i already had a microsoft account which i used to sign into wunderlist so i used it to automatically sign into to do that made it easy to import the wunderlist lists to to do pop up at bottom i panicked at first but i was able to figure out how to use to do in about an hour after installing it
__label__1 trashy app a total waste of time
__label__5 would love love love love an offline mode i spend 3 days a week without internet and have trouble keeping on top of my life without structure like apps like these this would be the one for me if it could also go offline
__label__4 great for maintaining and keeping a routine this is detailed enough to develop any kind of daily weekly monthly routine and flexible enough to incorporate out of routine events and distractions if you use it right it is a bit tedious for some people that's why the 4 stars but they can keep it simple and high level if they like but if you really want to tame that beast called your work week school agenda or personal days like me this will take care of it
__label__3 app is extremely useful just that the search feature doesn't cover all the notes in the app
__label__3 as far as calendars task lists go it's pretty much the same as every other one that's any decent what sold me on purchasing this app was the crazy customizability of the desktop widgets however i'm still miffed about the crappy out of date icons emotes the devs are using and that at least one of them all but refuses to get with the beautiful present with them i use icons to quickly identify types of events on my desktop agenda widget very useful
__label__3 it has very nice useful and comfortable look i used it with a pleasure unfortunately synchronization with gmail calendar stopped working tried to reinstall this app it helped for a week and stopped working again
__label__4 i wish i could create notes without having to select a date otherwise so far so nice
__label__2 couldn't login with facebook
__label__1 the app does not work after last nights update
__label__3 the app looks very ok but it lacks help or support portal i have accidently hidden the smart list like the planned how can i unhide them and also how can i assign task to my colleagues or employees
__label__3 awesome features but poor ui i wish the app isn't so cluttered with low res motivational posters and others' habits in the community really dont need know that someone out there is trying not to watch porn for 89 days why 89 who you tryna impress
__label__5 this app is incredibly helpful i need to take medication every morning and this app helps me make sure i take the tablet it helps me build the habit of taking it
__label__5 great replacement for wunderlist
__label__3 i wish i could delete things that automatically show up in my calendar things like holidays in other countries etc i don't want everything showing up that really doesn't pertain to me if there is a way i haven't found it
__label__5 great for organising my work life balance
__label__1 awful i can't believe microsoft killed off wunderlist and is forcing people to use this slow ugly pos or lose their data that's microsoft for you
__label__3 custom swipe options hidden in premium
__label__3 it's usefull but would be much nicer if there was an option to play a notification tone just once instead of repeating it continuously
__label__3 very costly
__label__1 quite disappointed with this app is used to be fine for past years currently is really slow when checking my task and is so frustrating at times this app need improvement on the server and at times server down
__label__3 i am facing sync issues yesterday i added a todo from my laptop chrome website today i didn't get it's notification on my phone it's when i opened the app when i see that it's being added this should have been done in the background
__label__3 no longer getting reminder pop ups what happened
__label__2 would be great but almost everything you need to customize it when you first install it is pro only you can't customize font settings it's pro you can't import old calendars it's pro how am i supposed to start using your app then
__label__5 i'm really happy with this app it helps me stay productive both in school and with my writing goals and even tiny things like just getting out of bed in the morning i 100 recommend this to anyone who procrastinates as much as i do because it's really helping me get out the hole i dug myself into with my bad habits
__label__5 yeah it is really good also i don't know how to make a daily reminder plus the tasks in my widget disappears and i don't know how to put it back
__label__5 as someone who is obsessed with trendy planners with pops of color i can't get enough of artful agenda it combines the convenience of a digital calendar with the joy of having a fun planner to organize everything in and they ade always adding new features that are awesome
__label__5 the best app for planning i met
__label__3 i wish it was easier to figure out i can't figure out how to make it look like the photos on here where the time is color blocked out
__label__2 does this works on android 10 i tried installing it and tried to make a character but it seems it's bugging doesn't show my character from character making phase reinstalled it same thing occurred hopefully you guys can help me here cheers
__label__4 nicely presented app efficient colourful
__label__2 didnt like that to really use it as a planner i had to upgrade
__label__3 i'm using the free version and its a disapontiment no themes you can't delete default lists it's ugly
"__label__3 i like it a lot but i think it needs a way to tell what day you're in it 
does ask if you did things yesterday but i sometimes get reminders for 
things on the wrong days it's still a very good resource"
__label__1 i cannt acces my account anymore since their password reset feature does not work tried on my iphone android oreo web version i don't receive any email to reset my password
__label__3 good app
__label__1 you need internet access and the server has to be up on their side for you to be able to access your to do list server has been down today and i cant check off or edit my to do list due to that going to be deleting this app most other to do lists work offline
__label__1 trash dont waste ur time unless u want to pay for the things that should b free
__label__3 can't make calls from the app by clicking on the phone number like google calendar
__label__3 font too small
__label__1 closing and crashing when adding tasks and project support answering but doesn't help
__label__1 stuck on setting the user name no error message etc used to be good
__label__4 great tool
__label__2 really beautiful and great idea it is unfortunate for anyone who doesn't buy into all things google and don't use google callander in this day building your app to only one service is not a good idea unless it's for the iphone now if i could get my work calendar on this app wow what a great way to visualize your day just playing with the demo showed me the power of this style
__label__2 the not completed tasks do not carry over to the next day automatically i wanted an app that would constantly flash incomplete tasks in my home screen otherwise presentation of the app is good
__label__5 great app it really helped me to be productive throughout the day
__label__4 it's a good app but can be better i want the developer to fix the following please 1 when you work with it sometimes it becomes laggy and you need to force stop and restart the app 2 when you type in it in persian the symbols like etc doesn't align correctly 3 if you add some native calendars like persian calendar to it it will become more useful and also an option to set it as main calendar not like google alternative calendars that show gregorian months not persian months ex
__label__3 it delivers what it promises
__label__4 gets the job done very well helps keep track of things necessary and streamlining is awesome
__label__4 very nice and useful would be even better to be able to set less than 12 hour cycle as series of short events inside short time period e g a few consecutive stand ups are not easy to see
__label__5 makes more work done in less time
__label__2 can't put cute stickers on them no cuteness on phone
__label__4 i like this app and use it on my android phone and ios ipad it's easy to use don't need to buy anything and is clear i don't love how some tasks are harder to remember and the reminder isn't how i expected but it's a good app
__label__1 suddenly not displaying all other calendars and after reinstalling app won't open
__label__3 any do to do list
__label__3 i think the app is very good has helped me to keep track of my habits however i wish there was a function whereby you could postpone a habit for something out of your control i e not going to the gym because you're on holiday this although a break from the habit doesn't feel like it should affect the moments when you are focused and in control of keeping the habit also how is the success percentage measured if you only have to do the habit a certain number of times a week
__label__3 there is a bug i can't scroll down
__label__5 near perfect considering you only really need a piece of paper on the wall or a calendar to track habits it does that and more with a clean ui it also has nice features when you create a habit download it to see what i mean discussion posts are a really nice bonus as well overall the app is gold
__label__3 the app was reccomended by my cbt therapy group but i do shift work and it's not friendly for those with rotating schedules great for 9 5rs who have single event tasks or those who tasks always repeat at the same tone each week or month i need my tasks to repeat on a 4 week cycle and it ended up giving me all my tasks together each week
__label__5 super
__label__4 it's helping me the way i think
__label__5 just starting using it but i already love it it is an amazing app and it is so helpful
__label__3 while it has helped me be more productive recently the notification settings are bugging out when i tap on 'add notification' and select a louder notification for when i wake up and press done i find out sooner or later than it had reset it to the opener my default notification sound that is quiter this has caused me great annoyance because of this and do not know why this app decided to bug out
__label__1 the app will put by default new tasks into inbox but inbox is not what you see when opening todoist instead you might see that there are no tasks for the next 7 days there's no logic in it app's assistant integrated with google assistant fails to find any tasks even if asked specifically about those in inbox todoist is cumbersome and annoying it's actually a general problem with task apps they're too much and fail to actually do what they are made for
"__label__3 i accidently swipe going to the right it erase task i have to write it 
again but everything else is ok"
__label__2 notifiction is not working properly when i set a task reminder when it is near finish dead line app doesnot send me task notification about its deadline not working
__label__5 this is perfect i'm able to get all of my family calendars in one place without having to lug around a traditional agenda also they are wonderful at fixing any issues and responding to all emails
__label__1 2018 11 19 it seems useful but it crashes on my phone 3 15 times a day 2019 04 13 no update this app would be great if it didn't crash just about every time i go to my home screen from anywhere also there have been no update and no responses to the roughly 75 100 error logs that i have submitted i paid 5 00 us for a life time subscription to the premium version do not spend your money
__label__3 nie ma możliwości ustawienia wyprzedzenia przypomnienia ani zwiększenia liczby przypomnień dla mnie to wada poza tym ok the application is basically ok but it is not possible to edit reminders i would like to be able to set several reminders for one event at different times in advance it would be good to have this option in the settings to set the default reminder advance
__label__1 i cannot log in to my old account since i have to buy the pro version in order to log in at first so my past progress is lost also i cannot purchase the pro version neither 'error 6 ' i have reinstalled forced stop cleared cache etc multiple times i have added a paying method to my google play account as well nothing has helped and i haven't received an answer to my email to you yet this makes me sad because i like the app to much to deinstall it
__label__5 vibration notification doesn't work please resolve
__label__1 its too complicated
__label__4 love the flexibility and options to track habits
__label__4 the perfect planner only thing missing is that remimder is not working
__label__4 it is an app with a good concept in mind only have to spend 1 to start putting your time to planting real trees the downside is that you have a limit of planting only 5 trees after i reached my limit i started to lose motivation to use the app just to plant virtual trees
__label__5 very useful
__label__1 to me its not user friendly i dont like the question up front before a tour of the app its very limited unless you pay for the pro version i think when picking a routine or something a bar or something should pop up with options or ideas to choose from
__label__1 it seems the app is not build for longer and more complex use it looks like it can be used for people that plan to follow and develop their behaviour but the level of this app is of a game takes too long for resolving the bugs and no reaction to feedback app crashes when using the calendar options this should not happend when using payed version of the app waiting for improvement or giving up using and paying for this app
__label__5 still my go to for planning on my phone or desktop
__label__4 nice but why does it need data tho
__label__2 so far i like it i thought there would be an option to sync your routine from the google calendar but apparently you can only sync the timeline the time tune staff has been very helpful and the app has alot of potential
__label__2 too confusing not neat
__label__2 no ability to add a shortcut widget to quickly add a task meaning it will take several swipes clicks to add a new task on my android phone wunderlist didn't have this constant friction it's a shame that they're shutting down wunderlist without having all of the same functionality
__label__1 too many ads and require to pay for applications that are commonly found in play store
__label__4 really helpful app i've looked at lots of other schedule apps but this one is the easiest for me to customize precisely great for making routines since a few of my routines overlap it would be amazing if there were an option to see routine titles in the widget timeline above or before the task in order to keep an overview of which whose routine is in effect both of my children have their own different weekly routines so it would be nice to see on the timeline that for example it's kid 1 who has school on monday mornings and kid 2 on monday afternoon instead of two time for school tasks with no specifics it would also be great if this app could be accessible from my computer desktop or if i could sync with other family members
__label__4 i've been using the pro version for four years and loved it until recent year end during the holidays daytime sync with google tasks stopped when i wake each morning i find that many or even most tasks have synced but can't force any more syncs for the rest of day i've reset and reinstalled the app without success with the holidays over i need to resolve this and get back to work and find that i can download other competing apps that work great please fix
__label__3 its a good way to manage your time but after a while the timeline menu bugs out and stops sending notifications besides that the app is very good
__label__4 really like this app the layout and ease of use however i did not see a way to go back and edit your scheduled days everything else you can edit time date category but wanted to change my days and i had to delete the entry and start over to modify my scheduled days otherwise i would've rated it 5 s
__label__3 the app looks great alot of function it wouldn't show me any shared calenders fix that and this is a top app
__label__2 my app keeps kicking me off after i open it
__label__3 its a good app but i think thers some glitch i cant have more than 6 tasks when i create one it just dosen't show
__label__2 mostly good but simply things like creating subtasks are incredibly fiddly why can you do it from only projects why can you only do it by long pressing and dragging slightly to the right to much marks is completed allow a simple option on the menu deleting tasks is several options in etc doing almost anything other than straight adding tasks is cumbersome as hell and just frustrating needs some real ux love
__label__3 i like this app and have been using it for a while but have started noticing appointments i put in the calendar don't sync to google and some how disappear out of my calendar so i have no idea when they are extremely frustrating since i don't always notice the appointment has disappeared
__label__1 app not work after purchase plz dont buy user interface not good beacuase eralier version is good
__label__1 upgraded from wunderlist and lost the ability to reorder tasks within a single day once it is ordered by date very disappointed
__label__4 awesome app that has really kept me on track i just wish there was some type of reward system once you've reached your goal i think regular reminders perhaps with some form of motivation attached to it would also encourage discipline and drive
__label__4 great app very easy to schedule i think it would be great if there is a button from the notification panel that allows muting of all events for the rest of the day another feature could be the user can push forward or backwards the whole timetable or pushing forward the event and shortening another from the popup for unexpected event that delays everything
__label__3 great concept store doesn't open though it needs fixing
__label__2 had been very good but now any reminder that is not completed by the end of the day gets marked as complete inatead of showing up as overdue on repeating tasks sometimes marking today's as done will also mark 1 2 or even 3 days into the future as done with no pattern behind the glitch has become very cumbersome to use and has resulted in many tasks getting missed
__label__1 doesn't work typing this as i have a tree growing with 8 minutes left and it's still counting down edit after updating to all the latest versions doesn't work just to let you know that this issue is intermittent and not all the time but most of the time edit i have emailed that email address for support but the email was not delivered
__label__3 leave it to microsoft to screw up wunderlist i used it for my show notes while i was out and about i could input my note and it would go to the top of the page now it goes through the bottom and i have to drag every single note to the top it's annoying
__label__5 i have used many habit trackers over the years but this was the one that most suited me it's simple and effective and even the free version is really useful the only drawback for the free version would be that you cannot track more than 5 habits but i don't want to follow that many habits either way so it was a perfect match for me
__label__3 as someone who has adhd and deals with executive dysfunction this is a very useful app there are a lot of paywalls though
__label__3 the app works only if you do not press clear all apps while the app runs the moment you clear you can shuffle between other apps and use it as long as you dont reopen the forest app the app starts running again once you open it and it blocks other apps this needs to be fixed
__label__3 when i'm entering birthdays i have to enter on the day after or it shows up the day before i have one birthday permanently hooked to a holiday and i can't edit it fix this please
__label__5 great use it daily quick and easy when i'm in a hurry would be nice to have a vehicle checklists etc
__label__3 it could be great but too hard to delete an item on your agenda it's like you put it on your agenda and it just doesn't disappear after it's over it just keeps on repeating very annoying sad that i paid the full subscription amount thinking it would help me to stay focused with my work day but only for a few days until it started repeating itself and i tried to find a way to cancel or delete something out of the agenda completely
__label__2 i like using this app to organize my to do items for my company which subscribes to office 365 however since the latest update my app constantly says unable to sync even though it appears to be working when i check in the browser on my desktop even uninstalling and reinstalling the app doesn't fix it i can't trust the app with my vital work if i'm getting sync errors like this because i cannot lose anything please fix this and i will update to 4 or 5 stars
__label__3 too many features that it becomes easy to be distracted
__label__4 the app is awesome really wish you could tag and name trees before you plant them that would be a nice quality of life change also if you could make the app more compatible for chromebooks that would be nice too chromebooks are excellent work computers and i need a good working app on it i really hope forest can work in the future
__label__2 too much advertisement not motivating nor relaxing
__label__4 nice
__label__1 swipe to delete is terrible takes almost 5 swipes so work rendering the app useless
__label__2 hard to use
__label__1 terrible app
__label__3 great app but pricing is too high for premium
__label__3 great for keeping track of things
__label__3 i used to use this app to set intervals of when i would check in to games i was playing but since they removed the timer feature for some reason the scheduling stuff doesn't suit my purposes still the app should be able to help you maintain a schedule just fine but most phones have that feature built in
__label__2 please stop with the updates especially on the desktop version you're just making it worse the most recent update sucks stop at least make it so you can add all of your previous my day tasks from yesterday with one tap i'm tired of having to add each one individually
__label__3 better to improve the app features
__label__4 it's a good app i like the encouraging reminders and memes each day i wish there were just a couple more openings for tracking but overall it's good it doesn't eat my battery like the last one i tried in fact i'm readjusting to use in the coming year
__label__2 typical of microsoft they bought a really great app wunderlist killed it and replaced it with an app that is nowhere near as easy to use
__label__1 i love the app but it won't sync
__label__3 cool app please include a repeat option
__label__1 dependant on another calendar app why why do i need to have another app to use this app i can't add plans or schedule without this app throwing the task to google calendar besides i don't use g c anymore since i once missed an event which i put a reminder through the g c app because it never reminded me i read one comment for this app that it never gave a reminder for a scheduled task and yes i have an idea why it happened
__label__3 1 notifications comes over my locked screen 2 notifications doesn't work properly on time would be very helpful if you add notes
__label__3 a very interesting idea i would give 5 stars but there are minor bugs in the apps i can't choose my user name it says there are all taken i'm sure no one else would use it and i cant add a daily task it shows an error when i try to add one is not the enum for frequency or something similar please fix this i really love this idea
__label__5 love it especially the natural language e g write every tuesday friday do then it will automatically repeat every tuesday friday
__label__5 this app is amazing you can customise your tasks and give yourself rewards in a shop it really boosted my productivity and helped me get through the tasks that were a bit harder highly recommend this app especially at this time
__label__3 it's a great app but i'm not sure about the security and privacy of it i like apps that mention in the description itself stating that they don't collect data from users a little info on that would be nice to see in the description thanks
__label__2 frustrated that all the useful features are only for premium not complaining that they are set up that way but that they dont let you know until you are set up also its calendar wont work unless you import an external calendar defeats the purpose of having a separate calendar without premium its identical to a hundred other free apps
__label__1 the app is a great app but customer service is terrible i paid for premium service but my app still runs as the basic plan and i've emailed them multiple times and they finally fixed it but once again this month after i was charged again for subscription the app went back to basic plan vs premium i've emailed them twice and still no response
__label__5 imporant functions can be used only if you subscribe it would be best if they rather sell this app than make people pay for subscption it's worth their money anyway
__label__5 really awesome app its definitely easier than other habit tracking apps i've tried and better designed too i get a lot of use out of it so i purchased the full version if you're trying to keep track of multiple things at once especially with the goal of remembering to do things this will help i have horrible memory due to health issues so i sometimes forget to do basic things and this keeps me on track
__label__3 the app is good but it would be better if it had a timeline please do something about that
__label__2 waa supposed to try premium but my payment won't push through it keeps saying that i have the wrong google password when in fact i inputed the correct one
__label__3 the concept is quite elligant yet also hard and confusing to understand it would be eaier if there was a calendar setting and or addition to help the user plan along with a timeline
__label__2 repeats tick now however i encountered another problem there's no way to restore purchases meaning if you subscribe and than reset wipe the app or your phone you can't use the subscription features anymore and to get it back you have to completely resubscribe
__label__3 hi wonderful ticktick developers i'm not able to buy the premium product errros are unavailable for this purchase or cac 01 i've cleared data on goodle play services ticktick etc upi payment credit card debit card vodafone billing netbanking none works can you please help
__label__3 gave it a chance still quite raw no proper planning and no way to see all tasks at once please take some inspiration from any do win10 store application however is epic the best very bad that there is no tomorrow and incomplete tasks from my day disappear
__label__3 1 кривой и неработающий экспорт и импорт 2 нельзя удалить базовые навыки заданий и характеристики 3 нельзя удалять сразу несколько навыков заданий и характеристик 4 кнопка отчислить данные не удаляет всё а только откатывает к базовым спустя пару месяцев снова установил приложение загрузил с автосохронерия данных загрузилось всё базовое и с диска тоже самое настройки тоже проверял после установки изменяя данные и сохраняя их потом итог после загрузки зброс к базовым
__label__3 i like this application a lot it is a very productive too they only issue i have is with the notifications they seem to quit working after a while i don't know what necessarily makes them start working again either starting the app back up restarting my phone or both nothing else seems to have this issue
__label__3 sub tasks should be possible to leave unticked for instance i might have put the bins out but not replaced bin bags on your apo if i tick the main task it assumes i have done the sub task
__label__3 the app keeps stopping repeatedly it would be helpful if the same is resolved
__label__4 i've only been using this app for a week or so but i love it it's easy to set up and use and i appreciate that it gives me a percentage of my successful days
__label__2 the free version has a minimal functionality there more advanced free apps on the playstore
__label__2 not sure what the point is when you can still access any app without interrupting your trees as long as you leave this running in the background note the lock forest to stay in foreground option is selected
__label__3 generally good but has issues adding a subtask is just weird why they can't do what wunderlist does with a place to add or a button and it's all a bit sluggish with some redraw problems but it has some great ideas to it so maybe it'll be good in time
__label__3 love the app but i just purchased the pro version and my generate your personal flower event gift won't appear in the trees i can use it says i still need to purchase it but then i can't purchase it either because the store saya i already have
__label__5 i love this app just a question for future thought the native samsung calendar app s8 when you tap a day you can easily swipe left or right via a box to easily show what appointments you have any chance for someday a l r on business calendar
__label__5 i really like this app it pleasing on the eyes it's well designed has a lot of social features but remains simple so you can focus on your goals not running the app i would suggest to add an ability for gold that is currency only valuable to you so that your personal rewards aka don't work against playing with your avatar and currency of that kind should be able to be exchanged within party that way you and your friends can gift each other screen time or whatever
__label__3 great app easy to use and convenient i love the vertical scrolling in the month view but it's a shame that it doesn't implement the functionality that allows to share my calendar events such that only a 'busy' status is shown and not the event details i use a nextcloud agenda and sync with davx5
__label__4 great app reminders are working and easy to use
__label__1 подписка на полгода пропала сразу же после переустановки приложения
__label__3 do you have plan to make it available as soon for android wear watches than it probably will be 5 star app
__label__1 since microsoft have taken over it is rubbish we had wonderlist on 3 devices and to do wont even sync the 3 devices the same time to look for a new app
__label__4 nearly perfect this app has replaced at least three other apps i used to have on my phone it's a great utility that forms part of my everyday life accompanied by an affordable pricing model and not the money hungry ideology that so many mobile app devs have these days it's nearly perfect i would love to be able to link a habit to a task and see a view of habit progress like chaining in other habit apps keep up the great work
__label__4 i would like to be able to import my contacts to it i would give 5 stars for that
__label__1 i uninstalled it within 20 minutes of paying for it its features don't work as hoped especially font and color customization the unpaid version advertised presets aka themes but they didn't exist in the pro this is on an android 10 oxygen 10 3 1 tmus 1 6t developer your 2020 3 3 reply makes no sense it still doesn't take into account this particular phone or my specific terms here's to those themes in future releases along with a dynamic icon and the developer's professionalism
__label__5 easy to use efficient beats the rest
__label__3 this is wonderfully simple and functional app update 4 30 lately i've been running into some limitations of this app for example for some reason could not sort tasks when looking at the label or on start screen what is more troublesome are latest updates for some reason they removed ability to customize start page that's the feature i relied on day to day they have also made mobile app less convenient to use i am now afraid to complete tasks by accident due to change in app layout
__label__2 so cool but insanely expensive also wasn't clear how to get started even with the manual i have no reading comprehension issues there is just no getting started section or similar then i saw the fees 50 wow that is high i hate when people gripe that they're asked to pay for apps am a big fan of supporting developers but 50 is nuts this isn't a service one subscribes to ex spotify and 50 is nuts to purchase an app not trying to be mean am fine paying but 50 is way high
__label__3 the tasks completed are no longer shown on the date itself which made us hard to trace back what were the activities done on that particular day add on review thanks for the reply but when i check on my calendar completed tasks are no longer shown i'm not sure we are on the same page yes they are still on the task list but no longer in calendar
__label__3 hey i was very glad to use calendar 30 until now i can not edit anything if i want to delete something is reappear every time i can't move or delete if is not working i want my money back i will change the review if you solve this problem edit i will edit the review after you ll solve this problem i send it an email also
__label__3 it keeps crashing just when i paid premium devs pls help me i really wanna use this app as soon as i open it it crashes and end abruptly i am hoping for your quick response thank you
__label__3 was great before the new 'redesign' now it's a pita to reschedule things i wish they'd stop messing with things may have to check out a different app
__label__4 i like the design and speed of the app but some features are behind a pay wall that are very helpful but they need to get money someway right the only thing that i dont like about the app is that its not possible to schedule repeting tasks
__label__4 though i would love to see it make improvements
__label__3 i love this app and use it for everything however for some reason it is no longer showing any holidays when i clicked on that tab hopefully this will be fixed in the next update
__label__1 resonse 2 13 20 i know that the free version is not ad free the issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away and this happens while i'm trying to add or edit something on the calendar had to change from 5 to 1 star because of these pop up ads will be looking for a new app soon
__label__3 it was really good for helping me to get motivated for a few days but when i shut my phone off the notifications stop coming until i open the app again and check off something
__label__3 good app however i have upgraded to pro version yet after twice usage now i can not open forest at all this issue also happen before i update forest i thought upgrading to pro will prevent from this issue editted hi i have sent an email to the address you mention the mail suggest me to disable the auto update uninstall then reinstall the app i have done it all for two days it was okay yet today i can not open the app anymore just like before the app is keep crashing
__label__4 helped me a lot
__label__3 really amazing but there are pop up adverts if you're not a member and for someone like me that's quite a few adverts daily very annoying but everything else is perfect fyi the designers have to eat so i'm not mad but god damn that's annoying would be really cool if you could at least watch a bunch of adverts at once so you don't have to do it later just an idea id be up for
__label__1 the app opens it self up whenever it wants to display an ad but the screen remains the same but i cant press anything so it just opens up in the background all day long to display ads and make money when im not even using the app this feature is ridiculous and it started happening every 5 minutes as opposed to every now and then so i just deleted the app
__label__1 pretty disappointed that the first wall i hit is having to login or register i get the whole cloud saving thing but at least give me the option and let the risk fall on me for data loss the app looked promising and i was really impressed with the bit of pixel art i got to see however i'm not sure i want to sign up and allow access to my details or habits just yet
__label__5 i found that if i am reloading the app from recent apps it is again asking for the password quit a nice feature even some important apps are not having this feature but say if i am switching to another app while seeing some habit chart when i see in recent apps i can clearly see the last viewed chart it would be nice if u guys can fix this issue
__label__2 excited to try it out but the app crashes whenever i try to create or edit tasks
__label__4 update this app is great but i'm currently not using it i'm not using it because the widget colors don't work for me i'd like there to be different colored backgrounds and text colors for past vs current vs future activities i want to see at a glance what i ought to be doing at that moment without opening the app i'm keeping the app installed in the hopes that the widget will be improved thanks dev
__label__2 1 create 80 000 events to several exchange calendars 2 sync it with bc 2 mobile app 3 and you will see how perfect bc2 works all the time anr thank you
__label__1 i really need help with the app but all is in mandarin when i tried to get in my account when the app is updated i cannot get in the app so i had to reinstall it then when i tried to log in it said i hv to pay for the premium when in fact i've already paid for the premium
__label__1 at first it was great then the second time i used it it didnt work so yeah too bad because it really did work and give me motivation to do my work
__label__4 add how long it takes to do a task instead of what time i should do the task
__label__5 yah best and very useful aap
__label__3 missing integration with google calendar
__label__1 well it's broken now i haven't messed with any settings in or out of the app and now there's no alarm it just vibrates i checked and it all still has the alarms and correct sounds yet it only vibrates when it shows a reminder why do these reminder apps always break
__label__3 i love bc1 and btasks but am disappointed that bc2 will not bring my tasks from bt and the new integrated bt syncs only to google tasks but no longer my toodle do account deal breaker for me why would you break the functionality with your own btasks app
__label__3 not really what i was going for it's ok i guess if you want to use google or your phones calender but i wanted a detailed schedual with alarms to remind me to go to the next event love the look but not useful to me
__label__3 overall i love this app and find it very useful my main issue is sometimes my reminders don't pop up which is kind of irritating considering i use it to remember my birth control when it doesn't remind me i'll often completely forget to take it or remember a few hours after when i'm supposed to take it like i said love this app and use it to track when i go to the gym or remembering my pills just wish my reminders would work
__label__3 like the concept but was hoping to see the full widget on my phone unfortunately does not display like the screenshot you show above on a samsung s7 edge not sure if it is settings i need to change i would also like better integration with microsoft outlook currently it takes me to the calendar but none of my meetings show up on the widget integrates well to samsung planner and google calendar but not my work app calendar finally like some of the ideas below of changing to a 24h calendar
__label__3 5 stars if option available that will allow tasks to automatically show under my day for the due date or reminder date scheduled
__label__2 in my last phone asus zenfone c i can use this app well but after i changed my phone to samsung j7 2016 it automatically connects with either samsung or google calendar where i can't edit the event colors freely on the clock i'm very disappointed so i had to uninstall sorry
__label__1 my desktop task and mobile app task doesn't sync even tho i am using same account google and i am on the premium please fix this issue as i may have to return to todoist if this issue persist longer
__label__1 terrible i'm not getting the pre alerts i set or the reminders themselves i go in to check on upcoming reminders see outdated ones in red that never alerted me
__label__3 wish they add copy paste function remind specified time before due date options
__label__1 dont work the best it got was the vibration notification worked i can't get any sound at all from this app
__label__3 edit2 only 5 habits available to track in free version edit reinstalled after a while can't log in at all resetted the password 10 times already nothing works in app but also can't set up a new account with my old email and i was about to purchase the full version well designed
__label__3 this app doesnt require your firstborn in order to function as similar apps do the quick post function is great however unlike other similar apps this doesnt have a widget feature to show what the upcoming daily task is on the screen so for me that is really unfortunate if this changes i will gladly give this a perfect rating
__label__4 widget remains blank tasks don't appear on my oneplus 7pro phone any suggestions
__label__5 its great easy to use lots of features
__label__4 great for organizing milestones and to do lists
__label__2 not very easy to use you can figure it out after you play with it long enough but over all not very intuitive
__label__2 edit update purchased premium sync doesn't work a quick glance at developers fb twitter accounts shows that they have basically dropped off the face of the earth no activity since 2018 app hasn't received an update since 2018 my suggestion pick an app that's still actively developed exactly what i have been looking for fantastic interface and thoughtful design i'm hooked guys
__label__1 i have wunderlist synced with my gmail account can someone explain me how to transfer my lists to this app without having to create or use a microsoft account or is simply that i'm forced to loose all my list
__label__5 it does exactly what it should do in a very clean yet detailed way excellent app that has helped me conquer addiction i love it
__label__5 i've tried plenty of pomodoro esque apps and this one is the standout planting trees actually keeps me interested in focusing longer without distracting me from my work i bought the premium upgrade months ago and haven't looked back my one suggestion would be to work in break times typical pomodoro is work 25 mins break for 5 work again etc maybe have a popup asking if i want a 5 min break every 25 mins a popup that can easily be ignored if i want to continue working instead
__label__1 pop up stating the app has been blocked by the system please authorize the app in your device settings troubleshooting or refresh background tasks is flashing on my device may i know what is this about
__label__1 couldn't find google assistant integration anywhere even though it's been advertised everywhere when searching the web for the app edit it's even in the description of the app here that's false advertising i will edit my review when it's out of beta and working in the final version
__label__1 it gives the option to add a local calendar but doesn't let you use it unless you also give permission to use a google or outlook calendar kind of defeats the purpose of doing a local only calendar if i can't actually use it
__label__4 events sometimes take a while to show up on the day you selected for them other times a certain day will not be selectable choosing midnight as an ending time for an event doesn't seem to work
__label__5 finally a habit tracking app that lets me choose the frequency of my goals and habits
__label__4 the ideal task mamager for me perfect combination of ability to customize tasks design and great for team work still would be better if tasks added to my lists wouldn't automatically add to all tasks where today tomorrow etc sections are sometimes i need them to keep in my lists and not be added to lists with some time attachment if possible i am your fan forever
__label__3 if more than one task is enabled for same time then it hangs i have to keep 1 min difference in both task pls fix it
__label__2 syncing doesn't work that was the whole point of upgrading to the pro version i log most of my time in the firefox browser plugin and it never shows up in the app i also lost my account my account wasn't authenticating so i logged out when i tried to log back in it didn't recognize my email even using forgot password i ended up creating a new account with the same email i know i used before losing all of my coins you guys should look into any backend issues with syncing and accounts thanks
__label__4 so far i like the app question i see a spot where it says notes for the month but how do i input notes i don't see the option to enter notes
__label__5 free version limits you to 9 checklists but ad free intuitive and extensive functionality are totally worth it best feature imo is shared lists and ability to assign tasks to certain people
__label__1 i donk like this app anymore
__label__4 microsoft is like wanderlist originally had issues sharing and syncing this to do list app appears to be settling down we like to it now
__label__3 missing obvious feature take a photo and set a reminder if it had that i wouldn't use google keep anymore even evernote can do that
__label__3 great app but why can't i add an attachment i need this functionality and although i have been using bc for years i might have to go to google calendar
__label__3 the app design looks nice and has good features this is a functional planner app i can access the week view in the free version though a prompt to upgrade to premium pops up but tasks cannot be set as recurring in the free version this is a main feature i'm looking for in a planner app also the look of the app cannot be customized stuck forever with that purple at the top of the screen there are other free apps that include these things
__label__1 after installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls after removing the app from my phone i received fewer spam calls it might be a coincidence but it might not be
__label__2 worst app ever after updating app its not even opening how am i suppose to use ot now initially as i started using it was ver good but it got bad after updation what's the matter with it
__label__2 the app is good but it automatically exits after a while and just doesn't open after i have to uninstall and reinstall again and again it gets tiring after a while
"__label__3 i can't allocate skill points while it's not something massive it 
certainly is a little frustrating"
__label__1 in microsoft todo there is no such option like in wunderlist to comment on assigned task with others and others can get notification on their mail kindly add the feature if possible
__label__3 wile installing on my note 9 it imported shows promptly each allready existing entry from each of my calendars but it does not import synchronize any new entry via any calendar within android i already removed the app from being affected by the battery saving option 'close the demo' pop up is not present thank you very much for helping out because this way of visualization by merging agenda and clock face is how my mind needs it used it many years ago and never found it back again as a contemporary app if only i get it to work
__label__5 a good tool to manage and remind me of my tasks
__label__3 love the program and it's definitely an improvement over google calendar just the easy moving back and forth between dates using the 'go to' feature is a huge plus in my book it does have some short comings that are irritating to me at least i use my calendar to keep track of my to do lists i save them in the description field first off the editing features such as bolding underlining line numbering etc don't appear anywhere unless like in my case you accidently discover them by doing a couple of steps of bizarre gymnastics once found i loved the features however the first thing that is annoying is that if you have a long list of things that go past one screen you have to keep scrolling down to access those features would be nice if there was a button or tab that would open a stationary bar at the top or a floating window that moves with the screen second issue is definitely a software bug having to do with the line numbering once a line numbering list has been established and you want to go back to add a new line or change the priority by moving things up and down the system does odd things
__label__3 the event didnt sync to my other device
"__label__3 it's a good app but it always need to be online to use the app most of the 
items are in app purchase"
__label__4 great app
__label__1 cannot log in on other devices
__label__3 ok ok ok
__label__2 syncing devices doesn't work even after reading and applying suggestions in the faq of the website
__label__4 i loved wunderlist for the most part i also like to do and think they've done a good job transferring things over one feature i do not like is that the today list has to be made the day of i like to make my today list the night before makes it easier to plan and be prepared when i do that now i wake up in the am and my list isn't visible
__label__5 the best habit tracking app i've ever used set your own goals no comments that make you feel guilty and minimal annoying reminders
__label__4 its a good app but i dont understand how in the picture they got their timeline like all their routines all my one has is the days of the week and to make a routine you only get two additonal tags im confused how did they get so many
__label__3 not quite as good as wunderlist for me but overall decent and as i need to use this for work now as wunderlist blocked i am trying to get into it broadly premium features seem quite pricey
__label__4 useful app in my opinion what can make your app a 5 star is add parsonalized image to tasks and possebility to make predefined tasks that you can add them to any list and global research you can find any task in all lists thank you for replying to my comment
"__label__3 i like the idea and will probably keep using it but it keeps telling me i'm 
not connected to the internet even though i am i don't know whether it's 
working fine and throwing errors or if i might be missing features due to 
these errors nonetheless worth downloading"
__label__1 what appealed to me the most about this app was the promise that we get to see the clock on your home screen however the settings doesn't offer that option now it's just another app callendar you have to tap to see what's coming up i liked the idea i could just turn on my phone and bang the clock would just simply show me my schedule idk if it's a bug or just a false promise either way it's disappointing
__label__3 interrupting buzzing the app makes a buzzing noise while i use it first one long silence interrupted by a buzz short silence then buzz before a long silence
__label__3 being constantly prompted to share list is a big pain in the butt my wife and i share our info with each other and it's a big nag that may cause us to abandon ms todo
__label__3 i would have loved this app except for the fact that i need to pay to even use it as a widget
__label__3 it's simple and easy to use but notification often doesn't work about 10 times a day
__label__3 just started hence neutral stars i was going to write to the devs but i see you reply here open is good i don't know what a filtered list is that is my only confusion so far i was interested in premium but put off by the monthly fee rather than a single license meanwhile i was playing with the idea of selling each premium feature separately that would give you information about what your users want especially after you add computer support feed the wolf you want linux 1st
__label__3 used to work great unfortunetly notifications no longer go off for ir making it useless have checked they are not blocked
__label__2 now i don't trust this at all i learned about the transfer just today so immediatley thought i'd swop over everything seemed fine i got a pop up to say everything had been successfully transferred then this evening i'm just adding something when i get a pop up that the transfer was incomplete so what do i do now unless i cross check everything in all the lists i have how do i know what's missing not transferred omg i seriously do not need this right now
__label__3 was working fine for couple years now 1 it creates duplicates of repeating events 2 while trying to change notification sounds it switched to silent with no way to restore 3 faq to allow single repeated event deletion says to sync to get 'only this event' but 'sync now' closes menu w o synching
__label__1 annoyed paid for this years ago paid full version and used it and recommended it now i am asked to pay yearly to remove ads what joke i paid for full add free version already and there is nothing new to justify the yearly purchase
__label__3 can't make calls from the app by clicking on the phone number like google calendar
__label__3 this app lacks a lot if you make a mistake editing you can't recover this can cause the loss of important information
__label__2 cant move the tasks up or down
__label__3 needs premium subscription for dark mode that is so greedy dark mode is a basic requirement in 2019 charging for different themes is understandable but for dark mode edit i have uninstalled your app for the moment thank you for your consideration i'll change my ratings from 1 to 3 for now
__label__1 ads started appearing whenever i'd modify something not cool edit i have no problems with banner ads but ads that completely disable functionality for a period of time completely defeats the purpose of using this app for better functionality
__label__3 so far it's okay as task apps go i'm a wunderlist refugee because microsoft bought them out and they destroy everything perhaps tick tick will grow on me we'll see
__label__3 thanks forest its a really great app but sometimes when i am not connected to the internet it doesn't work when i want to plan and push the button nothing changes and this really bothers me cuz i love this app and its a really crazy problem that i want you to fix it tnx again
__label__2 why this require this much personal details
__label__4 so far it is good but however i hate it when it still lags
__label__4 it would be more useful if user can provide interdependence and correlation between various actions and lists
__label__1 this app isn't optimized for use it's just a concept for example the alarm plays music but can't be shut off there's no acknowledge alarm so if it starts paying music yeah it never stops this is only one of many bugs so bad it breaks the app don't waste your time
__label__3 dark mode done but why on earth in 2020 i still can't rearrange my sticky notes
__label__5 i've tested several tasks apps and this is my favourite super simple though effective the views are just great plan by project and execute by due date overwhelmed add to my day just what you feel you can accomplish i would just suggest a delete done tasks button because though you can already hide them the list can become quite big if you use as i do recurring daily tasks
__label__3 good
__label__5 brilliant i absolutely adore this app so easy to set up makes using google calendar for agendas even easier than just using google calendars the events on the clock face just clicked instantly for me the fact that they can be colour coded is delightful the widget is great and even shortcuts from there can be personalised i got the pro version even though the free one does everything you need it to having 24 hour option is good though and even more colour customisation now love it
__label__1 i have hope that this app will get a lot closer to the superior wunderlist so i'll change my review when it does but for now here are my biggest concerns i really don't like how 'my day' doesn't automatically include things due 'today' also when moving a task to a list it's annoying because the lists are not shown under their folders i'd also like to see a 'my week feature' also two lists can't have the same name even though i have them in different folders
__label__2 i find the concept of this app absolutely stupid i don't think people are gonna care about if a virtual plant dies if u use an app and the only thing it does is give u a notification as an incentive what the app should do is whenever someone opens an app forest should open and display over the app this will prevent others from casually using other apps while their work is in progress
__label__1 after adding task to the app it just doesn't shows up
__label__1 it's simple enough to set up a task or event but not once has it reminded me as set to so looking for one that will
__label__3 hey guys this is good idea however i have a feedback for you several times i accidentally was clicking task more than once so i was increasing my level i didn't found related settings i think you should make task clickable checkable do you get me only once per day and highlight the finished tasks this features will prevent accidental checking therefore increasing level incorrectly could you explain me how to use such features if you already have them
__label__3 hate the ads
__label__2 clunky complicated and confusing not streamlined ugly color choice for non pro just a disappointment
__label__5 still exploring the features but excellent and by far the best of the todos i've looked at addendum having been using the app for a few months now i can thoroughly recommend does everything that i need
__label__4 its a productive app helps me to have my focus off the phone the concept of planting variety of plants and trees eventually having a beautiful virtual forest of yours i'm using the free version is outstanding not to mention the ambient sound feature not explored yet i'm happy to find this app suggestions add more varieties of plants trees decoratives in the store also add animals in the store it will bestow in users the idea of having wildlife in their virtual forest thank you
__label__4 a search bar would be nice
__label__2 hi i have mailed you in detail about the problem i am facing on my moto g5 plus i hope it will be resolved
__label__3 trying to sync my calendar with both my phone and tablet and any notes and or tasks are not syncing between my devices having to duplicate these items is very frustrating
__label__3 it would be great if the notifications actually works i don't get notified by any task i put in at all
__label__4 i've been using the app for a few weeks and i love it i didn't give it 5 stars because sometimes i get a notification that a task is due before the notification day time i set other than that no complaints
__label__5 best in the business
__label__3 not happy that when a new task is entered it goes to the bottom of the list instead of automatically to the top like it did in wunderlist it's crazy that you have to drag every entry to the top of your list
__label__1 i can't import anything from wunderlist via my android phone and can't even download it on my mac comp so far very useless
__label__5 amazing app would be happy to have simple record button to add taska while drivrin thing pop up to my head
__label__3 its ok works for me
__label__3 i loooove this app but i have a note 10 it was destroying my battery i had to uninstall it
__label__3 good app but had to uninstall kept adding reminders to all off my tasks and scheduled events even when repeatedly de selecting them very frustrating and inconvenient to get the notification and the email notification
__label__5 it's very optimised for everyday notifications notes list making and planning in general the widget is quite handy offering a preview of all the day of the week and tasks and events you have written down my recommendation
__label__2 app has so many problems i started experiencing them once i paid for the pro version no one has responded me back from the support to solve my issues some issues are as below 1 not fully supporting the app whitelist which is a big obstacle in working 2 not counting the exceeded time even after setting it up again and again 3 took so long to log in after reinstallation as i tried that to solve the above mentioned issues my advice don't pay for this app till these issues are resolved
__label__3 the app is great except for being internet dependant and lacking an undo button or a button lock for unintended log entries i know there is an edit your character section but there is no record of past entries to use as reference
__label__4 my go to tasks app happy to finally see a premium payment because you deserve money for this thing but immediately saddened that it's subscription only i get why but please add a one time payment option too for those of us who don't want to deal with such things
__label__3 just a fancy calender widget sure it looks fancy but it doesn't add any functionality it can't do much else it can't track progress
__label__1 app signed me out and refuses to take my password after resetting my password i log in and then they tell me there is a problem with my account and to go online to the website not user friendly and quite frankly annoying
__label__4 it's the best app for organizing my days but i have a little bug when it's running in the background i don't get notification about my new activity and i have to refresh the background data to resolve this problem it would be great if you could fix this little annoying bug
__label__1 i had paid once for this app and had login to it now i have another mobile and want to use my acount on this device but this app asket to pay first before login should i pay each time i change my device
__label__1 horrible now was good to start but now that my subscription expires december 1 cannot even accomplish a simple thing like removing tags from task names very disappointed
__label__5 awesome muito bom
__label__5 i love this app it combined of my calendars and keeps me on task
__label__2 گزینه آندو ش میپره
__label__3 but then it started locking up everytime i tried to load it ved it until then
__label__5 easy to use and full featured connects to google calendar and elsewhere project structure along with categories and keywords allow flexible use filters allow you to zero in on the key tasks and actions to be aware of now and here too
__label__3 as far as calendars task lists go it's pretty much the same as every other one that's any decent what sold me on purchasing this app was the crazy customizability of the desktop widgets however i'm still miffed about the crappy out of date icons emotes the devs are using and that at least one of them all but refuses to get with the beautiful present with them i use icons to quickly identify types of events on my desktop agenda widget very useful
__label__2 i had wunderlist but it changed to microsoft to do to do is more clunky than wunderlist it does not currently group starred items by category it does not have a variety of theme back grounds and the sharing of lists with others had to be done list by list and was unnecessaryily time consuming i am hoping to see significant improvements in thia app
__label__2 i like this app but it's always saying it has stopped on my phone
__label__4 very easy to use and intuitive wish there were a way to roll incomplete tasks forward to a new list or a different list i tend to make a list for each day otherwise love it
__label__3 widget non responsive suddenly u want to tick one item a whole lot of other items tht got clicked
__label__5 perfect app for both making habit and tracking tasks would be a complete app if they provide sync just only with google account for free
__label__3 i used to be a big fan of any do products and i used any do any cal for years i think these apps are really easy to use however when i set a reminder for an appointment every monday it only allows me to set reminders on every thursday the date that i created that reminder instead of monday it's really disappointing
__label__5 excellent
__label__1 no month view how hard is it to find a decent calendar with a whole month view
__label__4 simple and clear
__label__3 it's good but coming from wunderljst the spacing in this app between task is too big when having many task the list get unnecessary long and cluttered please adjust or make it adjustable will rate 5 stars if adjusted
__label__5 great app for tracking new habbits
__label__1 closes everytime i try to add a note event or anything else since last update
__label__4 i love that the app interface is so easy to use the reason i don't give it 5 stars is because you can't export notes it would be ideal if that could be done
__label__4 i started using this app in 11th std i'm getting its benifit but the only thing is that it doesnt shows the tasks we have to complete in some monutes or if two tasks are to be completed simultaneously in a hour so i humbly request to make some more changes in this app so that everyone can use it more comfortably
__label__5 good
__label__2 brilliant app for older versions of android this app have helped me keep track of my tasks at work and personal very effectively for years it is very easy to use i have upgraded to android oreo and reminder pop up stopped for my tasks contacted support but they couldn't figure out how to fix i appreciate they tried their best i've migrated to splendo as a stop gap arrangement till i find a better app as good as any do 2 given as this app is working just as a notepad to me to list tasks but i don't get any form of reminders
__label__5 i love the app it's simple and efficient with a smart interface that easily organizes my day support and response is also quick and helpful
__label__5 this game is a great way to get things done i love the idea of not being able o leave the app or your tree will die i consider this a great tool as i am homeschooled
__label__4 nothing is ideal but this app helped me to write a song and make my own project it's funny that same time i grow a beautiful garden thanks
__label__1 don't receive any notifications alarms
__label__4 i am liking it the subscription model is a bit steep and harsh especially for the full buy out at 50 dollars a suggestion i'd like to see two categories under the skills one that says increasing and one that says decreasing i am trying to set up a daily grind negative skill that decreases will power and motivation while increasing submission and routine i've noticed the dev team is really good at responding so i am hopeful for a response thanks
__label__5 it's really a great app which can help you organize your day and be more productive
__label__3 good
__label__1 the idea is great and i would have loved this however i will not pay to be able to use different routines for different days this app is nothing more than a way for them to trap you into payment don't bother with this one
__label__5 this app has most features for a free habit tracker and even the onetime payment is the cheapest in this category the habit tracker of choice
__label__4 it is a very helpful app
__label__3 good but not as good as tick tick the weak sorting in todoist limits its effectiveness when managing multiple projects
__label__4 app is really great too frequent updates in last week 3 updates
__label__3 nice app
__label__1 don't offer to send notifications if you won't actually do it that was the whole reason why i thought this would help me and it didn't will be uninstalling
__label__3 not sure why but sometimes when i make an edit on one of the items on the list next time i open the app the changes are not saved happened couple times already and i'm sure i clicked the check mark to save the item before leaving the app a bit annoying
__label__1 max of 9 lists then you pay 3 bucks a month
__label__5 i bought the pro version a few weeks ago great concept a few things i would like to change but can't find it in the instructions or in other reviews is there a way to remove my alarm clock icon on the clock face it's irrelevant didn't ask me to place it there and takes up precious space also and most importantly i would like the hour hand to reflect the real time so i can visualize instantly how much time is left until the next scheduled task is due for myself having to press the arrows to move the hour hand and watch a countdown timer to the next task is of no value if the hour hand issue can be addressed to reflect real time i'll give it a 5 otherwise the app wont work for me and it stays at a 3 i'm surprised no one else has mentioned this and i'm wondering if my install developed a slight bug update jan 20 2020 i received prompt response from developer fixed issues my phone was an older note3 running android 5 0 so it was a bit different works fine now changed to 5 stars
__label__1 i am trying forest out to curb my addiction but yesterday i noticed i left the app and my tree didn't die kind of defeats the purpose no i think it's a really cute concept but that should be fixed i even paid for the pro version
__label__2 just works with google calendar can't use it without it uninstalled
__label__2 please make it work offline
__label__5 this is the best and simplest habit app that i have used i had tried a couple of others and never stuck with them i use the notification feature to send me a reminder to mark off my habits for the day so i don't even have to think about remembering to update it
__label__3 i really like the idea of this app but it doesn't function well for me i'm a musician and i tried using it for practise but i had to use an metronome in the phone and then the tree always dies i wish it was possible to let it grow without having to look at it all the time maybe also a pomodoro function
__label__2 bad experience as the events created ex birthdays anniversaries etc in alarm mode is working only sometimes in such situations the event is just turning red but alarm is not ringing as if i missed the event
__label__2 new lay out is awful and takes extra steps to do everything that was once easy app no longer syncs to my computer app which has syncing problems of own since the last update it's slow on either set up and honestly no longer as good which is upsetting as i paid for the full year right before the update that screwed it all up i really hope you guys are working to fix the lag the lay out and the syncing problem this last update was a terrible idea
__label__2 trying to set a reoccuring event changes the date to one day before what i set it as trying to change the date back just creates a second event then trying to delete both events takes several tries because half the time they don't actually delete this is really annoying
__label__1 app crashed after creating a daily task with 2 day habit would fail and bring up a warning that the task failed and to press ok however you couldnt tap ok it just did nothing this happened every time gave up and uninstalled the app on a pixel 2 xl
__label__5 i really like how easy it is to use that it displays your progress in a neat and easy to track way and gives you options for how to measure your success yes no per day of days per week days you want to succeed and days you can 'cheat' etc it's pretty satisfying to tap the little circle for a thing i did and see it turn green and link up with other days would definitely recommend
__label__4 app is artistically awesome however i find it a bit annoying that once an event or reminder is over it removes it from the weekly view i love being able to reflect on my day and imput things i may have missed to have a full scope of my day
__label__4 awesome
__label__5 be the champion of your real life quests
__label__2 doesn't do what i need it to do with setting recurring alarms such as every 3 hours forever it just says how many times do you want this to repeat but doesn't let you choose hourly just daily weekly etc
__label__4 really nice clean ui and smooth ux not laggy at all you can divide tasks in groups and sub groups and attach a due date to it and tell you when the task is overdue the second best thing about this app is the plan app feature the feature shows what task you have planned for the day and shows you the task one by one and lets you pick when to do it very nice feature but how many times you can plan your tasks is limited in the free version i wish there's an integrated habit app feature
__label__2 this is a good app with somewhat helpful widgets the widget calendar should include tasks on individual days events and their notification settings are lacking if i want to be notified 2 weeks in advance i simply can't in google calender i can set it 4 weeks in advance with this app i have to set the event date 1 week before it happens and set the notification to 1 week in advance in order to get 2 week notice these restrictions are a dealbreaker
"__label__4 i would love this app so much more if part of the calendar wasn't obscured 
i don't mind the week number or anything i just wish i could see both it 
and the bottom of the calendar clearly"
__label__1 it was a great application but the lastest versions don't notify anymore about events and reminders i'll uninstall the application because it's useless it's ridiculous they know the problem and don't do anything to fix it
__label__1 when i set a task for repeat for a specific day of the week the app still doesn't repeat the task i have to set everything manually
__label__5 lovely
__label__5 recently replaced wunderlist with this app after getting used to it i have to say i prefer this app i like that once you pick a sorting sequence for each category it automatically carries out this function when you add a further entry ie due date i would have preferred that a folder for completed tasks etc was retained but other than that i'm happy with this app
__label__1 only get about half of the reminders
__label__3 notification sound does not work now before it does
__label__3 easy to use decent integration one major flaw in the shopping list no way of entering quantities schoolboy error
__label__4 been using it for ages improvements keep coming still waiting for an app to master the 1 year overview
__label__3 this app is awesome clean ui and great dark mode edit 6 months in and still happy mostly it would be nice to the the development team take a little more notice of the community no ifttt google assistant or wearos support wouldnt be so bad if there was an api but that doesnt exist either the developers have ignored these requests month after month for years very frustrating
__label__1 uninstall app that wants sell me every small feature done
__label__4 good but needs to increase responsiveness to fingerprint takes time to unlock
__label__3 i keep getting a popup that habbitbull has stopped working idk why it was even open in the first place but it is constantly annoying me and i don't even see any of actual issues that the crash is causing besides the annoying popup i've sent feedback a few times but no response
__label__2 the interface is incredible it's the perfect organizational app i've always been looking for this is all overshadowed for me however by the fact that it is automatically attached to your email with no way to remove it i would use this app daily if it would just exist in it's own bubble without needing to grab onto 3 emails minor complaint but it really turned me off from the app and if i had known this i would not have used it in the first place
__label__3 easy to use but needs better or customizable colors
__label__3 i like the app so far one issue is like someone else said why do you have to pay for the app before doing a free 14 day trial second why don't the notifications pop up where i can see them that was one of the main reasons that i got the app i need to be constantly reminded of what i need to do i have adhd and remembering a bunch of things that i have to do is a huge issue
__label__3 i wanted to try out and see how it suits me but when i was adjusting the start and end of the day it appears that the end of the day is not beyond 2400 ppl like me who sleep in the middle of the morning bcos of work tends to end work like 2 or 3am especially across different timezones if that's fixed i would be glad to pay for the app
__label__2 couldn't get the rest of my calendars to appear feedback help wasn't clear as well uninstalling
__label__3 unfortunately sometimes the reminders don't go off when they're supposed to however i like the easy design so i can just write things quickly
__label__4 great app does everything i need with multiple accounts
__label__4 great app had a quirk pop up last year but historically best user interface synced well and wonderful functionality
__label__3 this app seems great however i switched to another app mainly because the reminder alarms and reoccurring task options are locked without premium what the free version let's you do is fine but not impressive enough to risk a subscription billed annually they should give a free premium preview for a week or two so this app can showcase itselbetterf without access to reminders it felt more like a note keeping app that i had to remember to check which hindered the promised productivity boost
__label__2 i really liked this until i realized that unfinished daily repeating tasks get marked as done whether you complete them or not the next day that makes it pretty useless for tracking tasks i need to do each week
"__label__2 doesn't work on my asus zenfone 5 ze620kl it doesn't show up whenever i 
add the widget in my home screen"
__label__3 as someone who has adhd and deals with executive dysfunction this is a very useful app there are a lot of paywalls though
__label__2 fix the lag on moving events on the day display and i'll subscribe again ux is clunky get a second opinion
__label__5 to begin with i already loved this app because it's aesthetically pleasing very easy to use and all in all just keeps me in check with the things i want to keep up with in my life i was having issues with my phone so i had to reset and when i try to log back in i didn't have any of the data and i had purchased premium and i didn't have that anymore and i reached out to the support team and they were able to completely help me and merge my account so that i had all my data again and my premium again with no issue within just a few hours they are amazing and i highly recommend this app
__label__5 super cute functional it syncs with both my personal google and work outlook calendars space to plan priorities and meals weekly daily views and lists i don't use the stickers as much but all the colors for events and background are enough for me right now can't wait for the widget to come out someday
__label__2 i was shocked to discover that notifications is a paid feature i uninstalled would have been great otherwise
__label__5 great app for tracking habits with tons of options only thing i can't seem to do is set a habit with a start date in the future is there a way to do this that i am missing i'm a planner and like to set things up ahead of time otherwise it's fabulous
__label__2 as a user of gtasks owned by ticktick how do i fully synchronise my data with the cloud preferably google but will make do with the ticktick servers i pay for this service but only 40 of my tasks are backed up on ticktick server cloud any and all advice much appreciated kind regards john collington
__label__3 it's a good app but it keeps crashing when i use the app after a week's time it doesn't open i've had to reinstall it multiple times please fix it
__label__3 didnt work out for me
__label__5 fun easy to do notifications are perfect it's just totally amazing
__label__3 needs an amoled black dark mode i am sick and tired of blinding myself everytime i use the app in the dark would re install in a heartbeat if and when that happens
__label__3 doesn't let me view the lists from my android wear os smart watch
__label__3 this is one of the few circular calendar widgets available but it has a little ways to go before i'd want to keep it possible improvements sync to outlook easy color coding options for each scheduled event would be nice to see red for gym orange for meal times green for bill paying blue for sleep etc would prefer a widget that i can tap on without it opening the app small dot next to the widget is fine to open apps would also prefer a 3d widget that appeared to be hanging so when i tapped it it reacted to the tap double sided widget am on one side pm on the other drag to reschedule events hold to add events hold to edit events
__label__1 i remember the days when you bought an app and owned it now every developer wants to lock you into a lifetime subscription process where they can charge you for eternity i simply refuse to rent my own notepad
__label__3 love it i have enough coins but i still can't purchase trees is it only for the premium package
__label__3 the app is great for the use however i am giving it 3 stars if i make a new event and change the colors or add more than one reminder these changes erase after i create the event this results in me having to make those changes twice for them to be saved very annoying and inconvenient edit i add the events on my phone for a synced calendar the wifi connection is always stable as well
__label__5 great app synks well with all my calendars
__label__1 lists don't sync between phones and laptops as advertised and their customer service is absolutely awful i have been emailing with them all week and they are still refusing to cancel my subscription before it renews and ignoring my legal requests for all data they hold on me to be deleted
__label__3 the alarms don't work but a good idea
__label__4 the tracker has a clean interface and it's simple to set up habits i've only experienced one glitch sometimes when you're looking at the calendar view of a habit the heading won't show up if i could improve the app i would make the habit description show up in the habit calendar page right now you have to click on the habit name to view the description i would also make an option to include skip days so if you need to skip a habit it doesn't count against your streak progress
__label__1 updated to android 10 makes this app could allow me to go to other app pls fix this bug
__label__5 absolutely love this app paid and unpaid versions worth the time
__label__3 def prefer this to google calendar wish it was easier to see and switch to month view
__label__1 well it's broken now i haven't messed with any settings in or out of the app and now there's no alarm it just vibrates i checked and it all still has the alarms and correct sounds yet it only vibrates when it shows a reminder why do these reminder apps always break
__label__3 i try to write somthing and it exits
__label__1 this app was great but now in 14 1 0 i can no longer click on a project and see all of its sub projects and their tasks at once this is a stupidly frustrating change and it completely messes up how i use the app why not make this a setting i can change back or leave it alone altogether i will be manually rolling this app back thanks for making more work for me guys seriously stupid update
__label__5 the widget is really handy seems to work fine thus far
__label__2 i uninstalled the app because it sends my phone info to the developer
__label__2 i loved this app when i tried the free version the side tabs and all it felt like a planner then i open it up and it must've updated because the looks changed no side tabs so i paid for the pro version to get more out of it nothing has changes i go to landscape view and it won't scroll it's glitch to i have paid the 4 99 and it keeps telling me to upgrade i've already paid i emailed you guys and still haven't heard any support a week later so my advice to you all keep your 5
__label__3 not usable since the pop up cannot be disabled without completely disabling notifications they do not intend to fix this for anyone who isn't on android q pity the rest of the app beats most other to do apps
__label__3 works great easy to use but i wish i had a daily organizer
__label__3 i loved this app when i first got it though i still find it useful the app vs desktop functionality leaves something to be desired still i would have given a higher rating if the app didn't have a habit of moving tasks to a random calendar date instead of the one i selected i'm not sure i'll purchase a second year subscription
__label__2 it's too confusing
__label__3 love it only thing missing is a uncomplete all in the interest of recycling and re using lists cheers
__label__4 i loved this app worked so great i purchased it now it has logged me out and says i don't exist
__label__3 nice app but can't pay
__label__4 this sponsors exactly what you want it to do also love the colours and reminder options
__label__1 i had really begun to depend on this app and was having fun then i downloaded the update i now have nothing not even the image of an avatar there's just nothing there i have no experience no level no coins nothing i was having a really awful day and this was just icing on the cake there was so much i put into this game how can i remember all of the tasks i scheduled for myself i am so so discouraged
__label__1 hey want most of the features of our app then you'd better pay us 30 a year this app response laughingly uninstalls and writes this review so i never mistakenly download this again just greedy but our on going server costs i don't need cross platform sync and that's not an excuse to hold basic features like notifications and start of day planning hostage consider a 1 time unlock for all non server featues and we can talk
__label__3 i needed a replacement for wunderlist which we relied on for task lists for our business employees with ticktick i had to manually type in each task for each list because the import feature only put them in my inbox there's no home screen hitting the return arrow exits the app not a biggie just an adjustment the real downer is having to pay to share the lists with more than one person collaboration was an important feature we needed using microsoft's to do for now
__label__3 i'm using the free version and its a disapontiment no themes you can't delete default lists it's ugly
__label__3 yas
__label__1 have to pay for a dark mode lol
__label__4 very useful and flexible for scheduling tasks it can be better by employing ml to guess the best choice of time for any task
__label__3 i love using forest as a timer when i study however there is the ethical issue that you can't plant real trees unless you have premium this really frustrates me because they took an opportunity to help the environment and turned it into an opportunity to make money i understand that they need the money from buying premium to plant the trees but it feels like they are making people feel guilty in order to sell premium to them thank you for the response i appreciate you taking the time
__label__1 todoist has 1 big flaw that really prevents me to use it well if you schedule a task to be repeated daily and do it few minutes after midnight it will skip a day overdue tasks that are completed should add the repeat time to the previous date not be reset to the day they are marked compete
__label__3 not a bad app pretty good got a few things organized with it
__label__5 im in love with this app simple to use beautiful layout and keep me on track
__label__5 works much better than the desktop version as it doesn't close itself suddenly when you're not on it
__label__4 sometimes it won't sync but overall works good
__label__3 notification sound does not work now before it does
__label__4 i went a got the full subscription and i really like it so far but i wish you could download it for your pc as well
__label__3 i have set up notifications on my activities to pop up before one minute of another activity but it never works i don't get any reminders or notifications before my activity please fix it
__label__1 i love all the recent changes you have made especially the ability to undo things in the history could you please add an option to manually reorder tasks i would like to put mine in the order that i do them throughout the day and none of your sorting allows that thanks update it's been 22 months since you said you'd make drag and drop sorting an option i see monthly updates but not the one feature that would make this app user friendly don't promise what you won't deliver
__label__3 the time in the center of the widget most of the time does not get updated you have to open the app and then the widget is updated
__label__3 i would give this 5 stars if not for the misleading in app smartwatch settings extension purchase option i love the app but i purchased the extension to use it on my galaxy watch and i have been unable to connect it to my watch and use any of the settings for a wearable if this app can be used on the galaxy smartwatches i would love to know how
__label__1 this app requires a ridiculous amount of permissions including location camera and data cookies when i heard about this app i got excited really thought it was going to be nothing more than say an animated timer that only works when you stay within the app like youtube pauses when you switch apps this is just downright data mining and invasive edit funny that i mentioned this and now it doesn't say the same thing
__label__2 i love this app but my premium service doesn't seem to follow me i sent multiple emails to get it resolved however i'm only getting autogenerated response emails
__label__1 worst apk reminder not work
__label__3 the lines on the to do page makes me wanna touch those to start typing but only the ' ' addition is permitted
__label__2 inferior to wunderlist i'm so sad sharing is pain that works half the time ui is below average pretty much all the features are lessened i can't believe they don't see this step back
__label__4 i used to be able to tap on the widget and it opened but now it doesn't what's the point of the widget if it doesn't open was able to quickly fix in the settings thanks for the comment
__label__1 the recent ui changes are not intuitive and the snooze options still suck why can't we have a simple 3 digit numerical entry field plus a period selector with minutes hours days months etc the life reminders lr app has much better snooze options and time date entry options
__label__1 same issue as don smith who wrote a review on 10 10 19 will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in op current phone is the google pixel 4xl perhaps i misspoke in regards to the reply my issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content
__label__5 cute app that helps me stay focused it's customizability makes it really great so i can tell it what apps are and aren't okay for me to use like if i'm doing work and i need to check my email for something related to what i'm doing i can take my email app off of the black list also it's kinda nice to plant a real tree every once and a while the focus rewards if you're struggling to tame your time on your phone during times you should be focusing the free version is worth a try
__label__2 i'm sure it would be great if it didn't pick and chose what events to display from my calendar i have multiple events logged in my calendar the only calendar it's synced to and the only calendar those events are logged on yet just one of them shows up it has a lovely design but that doesn't mean anything when the app doesn't actually work for what it's intended for
__label__1 this app seems useful regretfully i am going to uninstall it it is too pushy and keeps reminding me to use it that is not my only issue with this app a day or so ago i found that it had put itself on my lock screen i did not put it there i specifically put the transit app on my lock screen i changed it back thinking i am uninstalling if this happens again it happened again this morning i noticed it changed back to any do in the place where i want the transit app goodbye any do
__label__4 it's an overall great app but the problem is that it notifies all of the notifications once be it at 8am or 10pm if there was an option where tasks are pinned on notification untill you check them from app i'd give it a 5 star
__label__3 ui needs major improvements the only app i believe which give quantitative habits also not just binary like 4 pages to read statistics based on that can be improved but nevertheless kudos for the idea this is only app which gives upto 7 habits in free version so keeping it else due to ui would have rejected long time back current apps in market give 3 or 5 max
__label__3 a to do list is a really clever way to look into progress you have made in a day so it is not just about completing the task it is about looking into the progress you have made by glancing at completed tasks you don't get default features to see the competed tasks to enable that you have to go into settings and enable that and if you are not interested in compiled tasks anymore you can't just delete those tasks for that you have to select each task individually and then delete it
__label__3 from an old wunderkist fan design and migration is nice thank you please bring back weekly to do widget or at least make possible to select only earlier tasks to show up in widget additionally in widget if due date is passed please show the task in red color thank you
__label__3 force stopped when a plant completed on mi8lite
__label__2 hello habitbull team i need to check all features in premium version so can you give me access to premium version for 2 days so that i can try all features and check if the feature that i need is present or not and then buy premium version
__label__3 why so many tracking scripts one or two should be enough no i'm not a free user dark themes are underwhelming contrast not good enough in them
__label__2 it sucks
__label__5 everytime that i finished a session it freezes i sent you a feedback with the system log please try to fix the issue otherwise it's a great app that keeps you focused but please do it asap update i've updated forest but still the same issue see feedback with system logs jan 5th 2020 no issues for the moment update 1 5 working fine back to 5 stars
__label__3 overall it's a good task management i like its pomo timer and habit tracker cons 1 attachment day free version that's too little please be kind and add more because of that i have to use google keeps
__label__1 didn't like navigation menu location update
__label__3 how different it is from google calendar your idea is good and interesting i am a knd of person who try following this
__label__2 it is fun but now i just level up and i don't get any notifs for unallocated stat points anymore
__label__2 since recent update adverts make the free version absolutely unusable i understand some adds have to be in the free version but full screen adds are very disruptive in a calendar app when one needs to work quick otherwise the functionality it great
__label__3 basic to do list does anyone know how to hide the task notes in task list view if i create shopping list i will see only one task in all view
__label__1 this sucks i want wunderlist back
__label__3 i love lists and i really love this easy to use app however i also love making notes to myself of a lengthy nature usually when i'm trying to go to sleep like my thoughts on a subject or what id like to talk about to a friend it would be amazing if there was a blank note page or lined page without all the frills of dates and times and priority and complete to compete with my eyes i dislike having to have multiple apps for same basic function i'd chose this over all others
__label__1 i got the premium version the main drawbacks of this app are 1 i cannot customize the categories 2 if i do a task earlier it still alarming on scheduled alarming time 3 removing done tasks is not available just moved to the bottom
__label__1 wouldnt let me make an regular account without linking something to it
__label__3 ui is great awesome but recurring task is a very common use case you keep it in premium version so unable to use this app
__label__5 this is the best planing app i could find on the play store it syncs with my google calendar enabling it to be an all inclusive planner but also has lots of personal orginazational abilities i am very impressed with this planner and would recommend it to anyone who likes to be very well planned
__label__4 using for a week now i like seeing the statistics and that the free version will track 5 habits
__label__5 like
__label__3 good app
__label__2 nothing special just a calendar app not worth the time it takes to set up clunky at best poor layout minimal instructions not intuitive to use
__label__5 fits my needs the free version is limited to five items being tracked but it would be counterproductive to try and develop more than two habits at a time
__label__5 looked for replacement to wunderlist found a much much better alternative ticktick is absolutely fantastic does everything wunderlist did or i needed it to do but much better built in integration for transferring wunderlist data over makes it so easy to start using and the layout and functionality is much more polished than wunderlist would highly recommend
__label__3 unable to download
__label__3 would gladly pay for this if it was outlook compatible
__label__2 user interface is so tough specially for a new person even there is no guide that how to use on front there r those things which r not useful for a working person like those xp and all don't know how to find week date or tym for an alert not impressive
__label__4 it's a great app it's sad it doesn't run on samsung wearables
__label__1 no replacement for wunderlist tasks are only getting added on the bottom of the list completely useless update still not fixed even so many people complain
__label__1 i would use the app but it's a paid app and i'm not sure of its true value because i haven't used it how is it better than keep or others that are for lack of a better description free
__label__2 pretty good app the thing i don't like about it is that you can't leave the app or it will reset your progress i use my phone for homework a lot so this made it inconvenient to use so far i've had better success using pomodoro timers instead maybe make it where you can whitelist certain apps so that you can use them
__label__3 i miss an option for recurring tasks like do something every 3 days where if i check it a day later that automatically shifts all following tasks by one day
__label__1 does not sync across my devices which it claimed it does only reason i purchased looking for my refund
__label__5 i am really enjoying this app so far it's just what i was looking for to keep myself on a routine and the price is great
__label__3 lack of function in free version to extent i couldnt use at all i am prepared to pay for planner i like but it was impossible to tell i didnt want to give 1 star though as it did look nice
__label__5 ச றந த ச யல ம ற றத த க ண வழ
__label__3 crashing a lot after update
__label__2 an option for daily jobs to carry over is necessary having to re add tasks is stupid
__label__3 nice app but can be improved upon in terms of navigating the app
__label__3 i love it so far but is it usable over multiple devices i am currently using it on my tablet and downloaded the app to my phone but when i try to sign in it says it can't find my email address
__label__4 loving this the only addition i would have is being able to view highlighted tasks and events on the calender
__label__5 great i already feel so much more on track intuitive interface issueless pairing
__label__1 paid for premium sync does not work publisher does not reply started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem going to try to get my money back nice app if you don't care about backups or syncing between devices or customer support switched to goalify and finding them extremely responsive
__label__3 i use todoist every day and it is awesome service in general but the latest update to the widget made it absolutely unusable for me it has too slim lines even without compact mode compact is ridiculous even though i have small fingers the quick button to open the main app is gone and the worst it is now not possible to select more tasks and do anything quick with them bye bye fast rescheduling i am greatly upset it is my main tool for staying on track
__label__3 overall the app is pretty good i have a few complaints but they don't imapct the basic usefulness of the app 1 the app doesn't make a noise when a reminder comes up 2 it has been sporadic and may not keep a reminder posted even when it hasn't been marked complete 3 the format for setting a reminder day is clunky recurring reminders are especially difficult and may not even be available for example there is no way to set a recurring reminder to every 6 months
__label__5 amazing user intrrface
__label__4 just don't give 5 stars when not using most function but those functions i use totally satisfy my needs
__label__5 simply one of the best applications that must be in every time manager's mobile
"__label__3 i'm looking for a suitable alternative to any do but this isn't it i'd 
like to be able to add tasks for tomorrow upcoming and so on 
otherwise i will have to either add each task daily or have 1 large 
overwhelming list having the option to see my tasks day by day is a huge 
stress reliever for me so unfortunately i can't choose tasks over any do 
at this time the rest of the app is great with color coding and so on i 
just really need a daily option"
__label__4 now realize will not show appointments over 12 hours out however would think should see them in overall list but not on widget good but could be just tad better
__label__3 the notification nor alarm won't work
__label__1 piece of poo
__label__4 just started using and so far it's good
__label__2 it's very simple and it's interface is so beautiful why did i put 2 stars then because most of it features are limited to the paid edition even the important ones
__label__3 not happy having flashing ads at the bottom of the calendar very distracting
__label__2 this is by far the best out there but it is not reliable because if i get a new phone for whatever reason the data will not transfer to new phone data will be lost or i will not have time to set the settings and input previous data in new phone and that is only reason i cant trust this app i am very upset that one flaw kills a very good app anyone that uses a calender heavily knows the trouble of my example again by far it is a very very good calendar app
__label__5 i have been in and out of this app many a times it was all my fluctuating mind not the app the app is super special i bought the pro version this time and opt to stick to it forever best wishes for the developers
__label__5 great for organizing and planning your tasks also the app is very responsive even on an older phone no wait time no frustration just add tasks within seconds right from your phone's home screen
__label__1 app has many bugs 1 start screen doesn't display first 3 slides user creating is totally not functional i'm using both android 9 and android 10 same bugs
__label__1 not great
__label__2 very nice app with a bad drawback today's repetition for a recurring task will not appear unless i mark yesterday's task as done here's how this is very bad for me i have many recurring daily tasks and it's a very tedious job to mark all my recurring tasks as done even those that were not done it gets much worse if i don't use the app for a few days then i have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day the app forces me to record false information a task that was not done on a specific day should stay there as not done and the recurring task should be generated for the following day you have only 3 options for a recurring task 1 to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day 2 not to mark it as done and it will never recur 3 to delete and it disappears and naturally it will never recur a recurring task should recur regardless of marking or not marking the previous repetition as done
"__label__2 this app sucks its slow and they make you pay to make checklists which is 
ridiculous"
__label__4 so far so good
__label__4 easy transition from wunderlist and it covers the vast majority of functionality
__label__2 just had a big visual update but if anything the app is getting worse and worse now most of the time when i tap a plus sign to increase count of something nothing happens i have to drag down to refresh and then after it thinks for a minute it'll update the count or not it kind of does what it wants at this point i've mostly stopped using it because of this
__label__1 i received a notice from planner pro this morning when i went to schedule some appts it notifies me i cannot use the app until payment received ii checked my bank and payment was made on 01 26 2019 i will be cancelling as unable to use
__label__3 ive been using it up almost 2 years now its a good app which i always recommend friends and cowowkers to use it few suggestions update the sort for task lists so we can sort by other filters for team tasks probably add the chat feature
__label__2 getting stuck after a day or two have to reinstall everytime because i liked the concept of this app poor execution
__label__2 i would've switched to ticktick but there is no option to change to a 12 hour setting from a 24 hour
__label__4 absolutely love this app 4 out of 5 for two reasons one navigation i think swiping between habits rather than scrolling would be a better interphase and also more intuitive scrolling habits only goes one direction swiping could go both as long as you're off the calendar two the free version only can track five habits i'll probably buy the app for full access because this truly is a good app however just a few more say 10 instead of 5 in the free version would've been appreciated
__label__5 the best
__label__5 outstanding app it's difficult to suggest any features i would add as it has everything i need the more i use it the more uses and features i find if there were more stars i would rate it higher update one feature i would add is a static completed folder
__label__3 miss the dark theme
__label__2 recent update causes the widget to crash every time i go to my homescreen on a pretty common samsung tablet
__label__3 plz help it says m typing wrong passcode it is not opening with my old passcode
__label__2 app works good but with the latest update 25 seconds of ad for adding an appointment not recommended after the update
__label__2 night mode doesnt show up under theme
__label__5 i appreciate being able to schedule blocks of time to tackle tasks i also love the grocery list app
__label__4 good app tracks nicely good widget sometimes notifications can be a bit flaky
__label__5 great little app lovely interface and does what i need it do by reminding me what tasks habits i want to do each day i like the feature where i can see my overall success percentage for each habit
__label__4 goood
__label__5 nice application
__label__2 it is good app but when i update it it stopped working
__label__2 it's been really helpful for habit building but it's now bugging like crazy and crashing every time i open it so not wonderful
__label__1 update 2020 sadly they didn't reach out to me despite me paying for premium version lost my account and no means of logging back in otherwise the app is good especially the ui like this app but until recently i had to change phones and the database could not locate my email and the app changed names and logo so it's all confusing if you could help me locate my account as i bought the premium version but couldnt log in to my account please help because i want to use this great app
__label__3 i don't understand why all the tags disappear once you start pay or join the trial the only tag showing is priority before i joined premium there were other options which disappeared
__label__1 first thing i did when i installed the app was disable notifications and yet i still get constantly spammed with notifications all day long that aside the app is poorly made ui is very buggy chat functions are glitchy and don't update mezsages correctly sometimes the main ui responds to nothing you can switch tabs and nothing changes till you close and open the app again almost all fun and worth while content is locked behind a paywall or subscription
__label__3 i think you need to improve the ui and the ui names its really confusing
__label__1 update after getting a response from the developer i would change my rating to 0 stars if possible these guys hide behind confusing and opaque terms and refuse to budge at all i'm so annoyed that my money has been lost to them really terrible customer experience original be very careful when signing up for a free trial of this app if you happen to go over they automatically charge you for a full years subscription and refuse to refund terrible customer experience and the app is just ok
__label__3 it's ok but it needs more features
__label__1 seriously reminder is a premium feature what's the point of all this then 1 star i can understand comments and labels but reminders at least other paid apps give reminders
__label__2 it just feel old
__label__4 this app has been so helpful for me to be more productive as i didnt take care kf myself before i can't complain about anything except sometimes when i first log in for the day my dailies will be from yesterday and will take a minute to switch to today i would love to see why so and so points are being deducted when you take damage from missed dailies like clean medium 6 health or something like that i don't think i'll ever delete this app and i look forward to any updates
__label__3 i like this app but i want to make it where i can make it a daily a routine so the due date should also have time
__label__5 amazing simple effective it would be nice that if it had a option that could set priority for examplr priority 1 2 3 1 with color red 2 with color orange and 3 with yellow like todoist app i love miceosoft todo becuase its cross platform and 100percent free
__label__3 it's a good app however i'm disappointed that thr alarm doesnt ring and bevause i missed the remainder i had to pay overdue library fees edit the app's creator is responsive and lovely thanks for the advise steve
__label__4 it's a great app it's sad it doesn't run on samsung wearables
__label__2 it's completely a mess can't understand what to do and where
__label__4 great but confusing when starting ro to use it
__label__5 i love this app it helps me stay organized and reminds me about every single task i have the ui is great and integration with outlook flagged emails and windows is exceptional i'd also love the idea option to 'review my day' to know exactly how much i got done and integration with outlook's calenders that would be nice microsoft has some amazing apps and getting to use them all ends up feeling natural hats off to the developers
__label__3 i'm new to using any do so i'm still really unfamiliar with the app i'm so far finding that the free version is quite limited i wanted to try the free version before doing the free trial for the premium to compare the differences the main point i'm unhappy with is the fact that the reminders don't make any noise so if you're not looking at your phone you never realize you're getting a reminder is there a way in the free version to put a sound to the reminders
__label__5 great support ads were displayed dev had it fixed in a day thank you and great product it's the closest thing to a franklin planner i have found
__label__5 very good app it keeps reminding me every week to do my weekly review and that's what i do can't wait to actually start using it properly tho
__label__1 the customization screen at the beginning of set up doesn't work tasks have tagging section with no clear way to actually add tags to it
__label__3 ive downloaded all the calendar apps out there and i like this one the most however it needs to show the text on the widget not just a dot such a bummer because i thought i found the one please fix this youre so close to being the goto app for calenders for the switch off of the stock android calender eagerly awaiting the update 5 stars and a great review once you do it
__label__2 it's misleading to list data export as a reason to buy premium when it is not included with premium it would be great if you could change this to accurately describe your three tier pricing system additionally the platinum purchase option is currently showing me the full price even though it is advertising a 33 off the greyed out full price is exactly the same as the 33 off price will give higher star review when these are fixed
__label__4 i haven't started using it officially but i'm giving a 4 star because the user interface is on point i'm starting my habits on monday hopefully the functionality part will be as user friendly as the ui thank you
__label__5 love the app very powerful used it for 2 years
__label__5 amazing
__label__3 no longer syncs with alexa useless for my needs edit thanks for the response i'll raise it by two stars in the benefit of doubt hope amazon solves your issue fast as alexa is integral to your lists
__label__4 a capable calendar my main grumble is that it notifies me of calendar events after they have passed sometimes a day or so later even more annoying is google notifying me of events when i don't use its calendar the calendar would be better if the developers included a facility to stop google reading my calendar entries
__label__2 simple app widget is bad left side has a bar that ruins symmetry also you cant remove the new task button also why can i change list color but cant change button color would also be cool to preview what compact cozy and whatnot settings do instead of having to select them one by one leave settings and go back in to change them again all in all its almost a 5 star app but the nuissances ruin the experience a bit
__label__2 just switched from wunderlist and miss it already why the widget won't let me display the tasks due today or this week like wunderlist did now there's only planned which list every task i've ever scheduled the design is very plain and it doesn't show the dates in different colours to spot what's overdue and generally picture the information quickly
__label__1 can't buy pro version on note 9 apparently in app billing is not available on my device guess i can't give you my money
__label__1 it keeps lagging and dificult to select the traits i want for my character ugh not worth it uninstall
__label__3 needs more features but i just started using it so i'll let u know specifics soon
__label__1 way to confusing to use the tutorial didnt help at all
__label__3 would be good if it is made offline atleast for todos
__label__3 i just got this app about 2 days ago i love it i would give it if the developers added new features such as more affordable 20 year more stickers love variety journaling pages customizable to be added anywhere within the planner fully customizable upcoming event pages to help plan for weddings anniversaries birthdays graduations parent to be planning baby or adopted child showers valentine's marriage proposal
__label__5 great
__label__2 in general i really like this app but every time it does an update or my phone restarts i have to go to redo the battery optimization settings because otherwise i don't receive notifications this is just ridiculous that it doesn't save my settings 3 months later and still have the same problem
__label__2 calendar sync for a productivity app is a pro only feature
__label__3 the idea of the app is great but many services are paid the free version is more limited than i thought
__label__2 user interface is so tough specially for a new person even there is no guide that how to use on front there r those things which r not useful for a working person like those xp and all don't know how to find week date or tym for an alert not impressive
__label__3 nice app
__label__4 very useful for making to dos and not forgetting anything it syncs perfectly across several platforms web ios android and also allows for easy sharing and collaboration of tasks
__label__1 garbage the one time i can't remember if i checked the notification for taking my medication or not there was no way to go and see which days i checked it or not what's the point of that
__label__4 great so far two requests for devs i just started using timetune and i like it has most options i was looking for to help my time management and utilize time blocking requests 1 whole week view i'm looking for healthy rhythm and repetition in my weekly routine as an independent worker difficult to visualize when i can only view one day 2 sharing i'd love to be able to share my routine with my wife through this app perhaps two ways to share by whole routine and by tag
__label__1 love this app got the pro version it will save a lot of my cognitive work please fix this bug the colour of events are set to blue when the event is created using the default colour of the sub calendar overall the app needs better ux design w r t the complex menu for customization and some other things e g it was hard to figure out how to get separate widget for different calendars but in terms of functionality it is awesome
__label__2 not a fan of being constantly reminded the moment i begin 2 experience your app that every setting or option is not fully functional or could be better with a subscription everytime i look settings i'm reminded when i configure the app i'm told about the subscription of 35 year how bout letting users experience the full benefits of what u have 2 offer for 30 days b4 making us sign a yearly sub instead of 7 day free trial this is an opportunity 4 u to humble your customer base sunriseapp
__label__3 navigation needs work you can only navigate with the many buttons in the app the back button closes the app feature request has weekly and monthly report would like a daily report to share with an accountability partner also would be great to generate report based on category
__label__3 setting habits was not simple enough and at the same time was missing options it kept telling me to choose a number i would press next and same error
__label__3 there's nothing wrong with this app although it could be slightly better but it's just like google calendar in fact it's integrated with google calendar and all your events show up in gc even the selections of colors in association to events and how you input information is the same if you're an android user go ahead and just use the built in google calendar if not your samsung htc whatever one i have near stock android so i get google same difference really
__label__2 i used to like this app been using it for a few years with tolerably okay results but it's been having too many problems with sync and with failing to load karma data not only that but if you miss checking a box but don't see that omission until the next day there's nothing you can do about it maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good i'd like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my android but apparently that can't be done and if i delete my online account i delete everything i think i just want to dump this flawed app and see if i can find a good app that does everything offline in one device with no registration required
__label__5 ok
__label__5 habitbull is what i was looking for in a habit tracking app it has a lot of customization for what constitutes a goal streak and a simple overview and data entry screen i was happy that premium is just a one time fee and it's cool to see the posts from other people working on their goals too
__label__3 really enjoying this app but wish i could track more than 5 habits
__label__3 not happy that when a new task is entered it goes to the bottom of the list instead of automatically to the top like it did in wunderlist it's crazy that you have to drag every entry to the top of your list
__label__1 dl'd to try this app out but could not get past the initial setup buttons missing labels or information lethargic loading issues and the graphics are really sub par for what other games host currently even the initial avatar appearance has most things locked behind a pay wall and keeps putting me in a wheelchair the idea behind the app has a lot of potential and would be a joy to see if they can make it better and working properly will have to wait and see as is not functional
__label__3 having some equipment related bugs
__label__4 very good experience does what we need
__label__3 i have suceeded 100 and indicates so in the tracker but only says 87 on the app one of my goals was yoga on mondays not sure if it is penalizing me for the other days
__label__1 no longer work in android 9 it can t load meetings from outlook or even from google accounts interface is badly designed too
__label__5 a great app to keep you up and moving especially being in quarantine this review was made at the time of covid 19
__label__3 i think it could be more user friendly but maybe i haven't explored it enough it keeps asking for a rating maybe it will stop now
__label__5 coupled with sectograph just the best widget for me and in sync with the different calendars i need this is the perfect app the customization and simple look makes everything clear if there was a desktop app as well i'd get it too
__label__4 nice app bug with achievement exp gained it only adds on to current hero exp without leveling up eg 144exp 25exp why does skill decay even after doing a task that increases it
__label__1 sometimes the app couldn't plant the tree and couldn't help to calculate my study time correctly
__label__3 it does not have the ending time of an event
__label__5 useful and easy
__label__4 only began using it but seems intuitive to use love that i have various lists link to projects share lists assign tasks and gave due dates
__label__1 i don't care for the dashboard
__label__1 this app don't even deserve 1 star but no other way in year 2020 an app that just share task with other but not the time which is not that worth secondly no themes no fun give up this app
__label__5 this app is literally saving my grades just an idea for a different way of using maybe add an option where you put your phone down and it just plants a randon tree and when you pick your phone back up you can see what tree is planted or how many you got its just sometimes i need to focus but i dont know how long for and then i either kill the tree or feel i could have planted for longer with more coins
__label__3 widget sering ngadat dan ndak update dengan hari dan jamnya butuhnya pasang widget agar terupdate tapi seringnya malah gak cocok dengan waktunya notifikasinya pun sering g muncul
__label__2 overall it's a great app that i use every day but what i truly hate is i paid for the full version and since i have 3 google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions i'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize i bought it because it defaults to the wrong account if they fix and let me select correct amount i'll bump my rating back up should have an option sad
__label__2 all the main options are charged then why list the app for free might as well list it as charged app
__label__2 suddenly need a subscription after i had paid for a full version and some of my calendars no longer work with the app not impressed
__label__4 great app simple and neat ui it would however be nice if you could also include a passcode lock
__label__3 respected team it is not working in oppo f5 actually it is not reminding me despite off given all the permissions find out the solutions
__label__1 me in the future please don't install it it's too complex
__label__3 the feature of customization for repeating calendar event function has disappeared when attempting to modify it used to asked do you want to delete all calendar event in the series or delete this particular function except for grandfathered calendar functions the feature of attempting to delete a particular calendar function event no longer exists
__label__3 quick but need moree practice to add sub lines to proper list
__label__4 thank you for bringing back the clock time picker this app is essential for my daily todos
__label__2 the idea is amazing and it's useful except it stop working can't show its widget after update
__label__3 for anyone who wants to manually order your list just long press the task and drag drop it it's really easy my 3 out of 5 is because the widget seems broken i have a large 3 x 3 widget to see my planned tasks the list randomly disappears in the widget open the app and it's still there go to the widget it's still missing randomly it comes back if this gets fixed it'll be 5 of 5
__label__2 good app sadly it onlt worked for a day now it crashes instantly
__label__5 this app is great but i am having one issue that is dragging me away to other apps i like less overall my work lunch hour switches every week between 11 00am and 12 00pm i wish there was a way i could have a task repeat every two weeks on weekdays so that i could have these 2 tasks auto rotate weeks is this possible in this app
__label__3 seems good but i would need admin approval to access my work outlook calendar so it's pretty unusable for me
__label__3 phone app is great and syncs well but windows app always jumbles my tasks so i would recommend using online app on your computer
__label__4 is a very unique to do list which keeps you complete all task the only problem i found with this app is that sometimes is very buggy you cannot use this app offline and you cannot sync your calendar with this overall is very recommended is like a game
__label__1 doesn't sync anymore i paid for the pro version
__label__3 for me it's hard to use it and time taker
__label__1 app is very buggy completed tasks keep showing up as not completed notification alarm won't work uninstalling
__label__2 o aplicativo não tem uma lista de tarefas deletadas eu deletei uma tarefa sem querer o aplicado deleta a tarefa se eu arrastar pro lado e agora não consigo lembrar do que se tratava
__label__2 every time the company upgrades the app or make any changes subscribers can't access the calendar sign in page has many issues
__label__3 it's a good sentiment but it didn't really work for me i wanted to like it but the motivation for getting stuff outweighs the motivation to actually do the things you're supposed to and unless you join a guild or any sort of group there's no accountability if you don't want to use it as a social app then i can't imagine mustering up the focus and drive not to just lie
__label__2 good shared tasks but app itself makes me angry it keeps forgetting i am logged in with my google account so i need to login for like each two weeks or so and it also forgets my settings edit unfortunately this has not been fixed yet even though i had sent logs and communicated with you decreasing my rating
__label__1 bought the paid version the app fails to get data from anything except gmail good concept but lacks in across provider connectivity
__label__1 poor settings options i tried to set a schedule for an entire day to be more productive kept getting emails for each task at the time i scheduled it i also got notification pop ups on my macbook calendar app which seemed to sync itself with my google calendar i went to google calendar to turn it off but it wouldn't let me i had to delete all 10 emails hide the notifications and now i will be uninstall this app it should have an option to disable syncing nice idea lazy developers
__label__5 love this app helps in daily tasks
__label__2 hello team i am not able to set different colours for different sectors could you please help me show how its done i purchased your app in light that it will give me option for above
__label__5 best but bringing menu bar from side to below was a big mistake bc there is ad bar and then there is menu bar so its like half of the screen is gone and its so ugly ik ad bar will be gone if we pay i had to downgrade to 2 7 1 to fix it plz bring back menu bar to where it was so that i can update
__label__3 setting up late events past 11pm is literally impossible start and end times days will shift randomly when i make a change to the other whenever i do manage to get both right i get a same time error even though clearly the start and end times are different
__label__4 i bought the pro version and like it so far for now what i'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself with the left and right arrows and not only from inside the app why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself other than that the app seems to be very practical if the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented it would be a 5 star app for me thanks
__label__4 give more features on par with google keep dark mode too is an essential tool that's sorely missing
__label__5 easy to use previous entry can be access at any point
__label__1 not what i thought it was this only blocks out time for your calendars i was looking for something that would help with daily routines i even tried to use the calendar before giving up but it refused to sync so it's useless
__label__4 i like it and i would definitely pay 20 for it but i cant justify paying a subscription if only i could pay once
__label__2 this app would be 100x better if it incorporated some of the editting customizing functions of the other to do list apps out there i want to be able to strike through each of the to do items and view deleted archived completed items be able to choose colors etc
__label__4 it's great the only issue i'm having is when i snooze something and it then occurs at the same time as another event they appear to get grouped together and i have to snooze or dismiss them both
__label__2 guys you created a great app that i'd been using for years but the latest update is weird modal views when selecting a single task why do i need it instead of previous submenu for rescheduling no ability to choose multiple tasks only by top menu select tasks strange icons that all makes me really sad rolled out to the previous friendly todoist
__label__2 i really enjoyed this app but now if i delete a daily reminder i still get the notification for it which is highly annoying please fix this it distracts me from my work each time i here my notification go off for a deleted reminder
__label__5 amazing
__label__4 love this app has really helped with sorting out school work fitness and study time into my schedule only reason it isn't a 5 star is the lack of a watch face for my galaxy watch
__label__4 decent
__label__3 i just want a star coral6
__label__4 great app the only two features that would make it even better 1 add option to hide declined events this should be simple 2 recreate it as samsung gear watchface
__label__4 love the app but there is a bug in the current version of the app where next week actually schedules things for two weeks out actually scheduling in general in the app seems a little wonky these are new issues as of a few weeks ago otherwise it would be 5 stars
__label__3 there's a visible lag when scrolling left or right in day view even in high end phones going back from a task edit screen without making any changes also asks shows popup whether you wish to save or discard changes that popup is irritating otherwise an effective and the point app cheers
__label__2 having trouble syncing on new device says there is no internet connection but my connection is strong
__label__4 this app is great so far but i wish there was an option to select several days at a time for each routine if there is already pls let me know
__label__4 liked the setup so much that i quickly became a premium user the widget alone is worth it i love the flexibility the app allows in specifying when i can work on developing a habit as i am frequently adding habits i would like to rearrange habits in the list to make it easier to find them hopefully this is an easy fix then this will be a 5 star app
__label__1 paid for the pro version but can't keep the changes i make to the settings
__label__4 almost all the functionality of the franklin planner this is a great app
__label__5 very useful application intuitive and lots of features thanks
__label__3 looks very good but i would love to see cloud sync for example with google tasks
__label__1 paid for premium so i could sync between devices but it doesn't work and customer service will not respond to my inquiries
__label__3 i used this app a few times but now facebook login won't work it'd be a better app if you could just sync it with your google account
__label__1 one star only because the checklist item has way too big paddings thus i can see 30 40 less items on a screen than in wunderlist microsoft ux team how could you make such a huge design mistake
__label__4 i love the concept look of this mobile app the desktop version i wish i could set recurring tasks or add time reminders to tasks you also can't set reminders if you add an event directly into artful agenda you have to add it to your google calendar first to set the reminder then let it sync to artful agenda i've paid for the year subscription i'm really hoping it has more functionality by the end of my subscription or i won't be renewing
__label__5 great calendar
__label__2 bad experience as the events created ex birthdays anniversaries etc in alarm mode is working only sometimes in such situations the event is just turning red but alarm is not ringing as if i missed the event
__label__1 i really want to use this app but on my galaxy s10 the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in are blank the character visuals on the character customization are invisible and on the settings menu i scroll down and the options start to overlap each other hard to describe i will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app but currently it's unusable for me
__label__3 decent app but not worthy of monthly fees what happened to 1x pro licenses
__label__2 tutorial
__label__3 not available offline tsk
__label__3 it's a great app but it has glitches i tried setting my work hours for tomorrow's date but when i clicked save and went back to the graph it had the hours set for today not tomorrow
__label__1 the link provided is the same robot answer i received by email i still cannot download the the pro version i bought as it was removed from the market if you remove it from the market then obvisouly no one can download it and if it is not removed provide the download link else do not tell your customers that it is a perpetual license did you ever hear about short links
__label__3 this app description doesn't tell you this is not free you get a free trial then pay about 15 a month there's plenty of truly free apps that work just as good or better uninstalling
__label__5 simple and rewarding the updates are amazing
__label__5 very easy to use
__label__3 the app keeps crashing and i lost all the progress after reinstalling it i have the paid version
__label__5 perfect the home page clock calendar widget i wish i had years ago so easy to have a glance and see what tasksand events are coming up for the day in a really compact way great functionality customisation and options to add app task shortcuts in or around the widget
__label__3 i would give 5 stars if it had the feature to rearrange the items with your specific order instead or being predetermined
__label__3 pro version and it still won't handle the recurring tasks smoothly please fix it i've restarted my phone several times and still nothing
__label__3 looks great but reminders notifications are a premium feature google calendar is better
__label__5 this app is the best to schedule my day further more here are some possible features to add a homework option w reminder water reminder mood tracker monthly routine and calendar also would like if premium was cheaper
__label__3 phone app is great and syncs well but windows app always jumbles my tasks so i would recommend using online app on your computer
__label__3 looks cool but i do not find it actually helpful unless you write down everything you do every hour every day
__label__3 no comments
__label__1 i liked it at first even paid for it too but now it won't sync across my devices so i need to find something else that will
__label__5 so glad i found this hope it keeps working the way it does i just installed it just keeps getting better and better so far i absolutely love it
__label__5 exactly what i was looking for to help establish routines i like that i can set it to place habits on certain days and don't manually have to readd them my only suggestion is to be able to manually sort items
__label__1 want use only not sharing
__label__4 i love this widget it's such a clear picture of the time and schedule my only thing is i wish it was compatible for the galaxy watch i got the app because i saw it on the watch i'm the pictures but it doesn't work with the galaxy watch if this was improved to work with the watch i would give it 5 stars
__label__4 love it only wish there was more instruction on how it all works it does alot will be perfect once i learn how it's all done
__label__3 the free app works well but pops up with annoying notifications every now and then to remind you to set more reminders kind of pointless i'm also not a fan of the subscription model for premium the layout and app itself is good though so it's a shame about those negatives i would have considered buying if there was a one time payment model
__label__1 used to work ok now something is skrewy now if i restart my phone every single task comes up as a notification never mind of when the tasks were are due and the schedule i set now after i dismiss tasks they pop up again ignoring its schedule also wish app could remember which day the task is for if you have a daily task that you complete after midnight it thinks you completed it early and won't remind you later that day finally wish app opened to an overview of all lists
__label__5 love this app it's so easy to use it helps me be organized with the option of having multiple lists plus it's colorful
__label__4 the app is excellent simple streamlined functional to do list however the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control how do i select and reschedule a group of tasks how do i open the app from the widget so i don't need both the widget and an icon if i wanted to do complex editing i could easily open the app and the widget could do things the app couldn't give it back
__label__3 phone samsung galaxy j7 star i just started using the app i'll upgrade or downgrade accordingly
__label__2 can't add more than 5 task to calendar without monthly fee
__label__3 interesting and promising but not refined or intuitive chat function is one of the worst i've ever encountered
__label__2 list feature sucks i don't need to manage myself so i can't speak to that functionality i just wanted a list app preferably one that worked with google assistant although that feature works great the list feature kind of sucks in an attempt to look new and edgy the user experience went down the drain i found it clunky irritating i shouldn't have to add a new item to the grocery list just to be able to uncheck items i need again and that's just one of many irritations anylist baby
__label__5 such an incredible app made my life well organised well handful notification settings are pretty good i think you really don't need the pro subscription and if u use it alot then u can go for it for students like me its pretty much get the work done
__label__4 really well for procrastinators and forgetfulness i constantly forget things but this keeps me on track i will admit though that the tags should have an option on sorting them clicking and dragging them to be in a specific order other than that perfect app and no issues so far
__label__2 wunderlist was much better more user friendly for example there is no select of tasks due on the week
__label__4 hi i love the app there's a bug that i want to share i created a daily task once a day but it doesn't go away after completing it from today's task what do i do thank you
__label__3 it worked great to start with but now i'm not getting task notifications and some of my events are not showing up on my calendar widget
__label__5 es great good enough for me to use it to help fix my sleeping pattern
__label__1 24 hour mode is a pro feature
__label__1 would you please add day and night mode for widgets that would sync with system's day and night status thank you
__label__3 it's pretty useless google does a better job
__label__3 so far its working for me i needed something that could ring or vibrate
__label__2 meh i left the meh on 2 2019 today is 3 2020 while the calendar is ok the themes never change and really are not anything of interest they really need to be completely changed also color coding helps me keep track of a lot of things i have going on the measley 7 or 8 colors they have are too few what no pink a nice hot pink so it will stand out i mean idk i'm still just meh
__label__5 an amazing all in one to do list pomodoro app calendar app habit tracker i have made a video about it and all the people who have tried it were impressed by it i just love it thinking truly about purchasing the full version
__label__3 i've been using bc1 for years and i've installed bc2 on at least 2 seperate occasions bc2 is so not as good as bc1 the overall look makes it look like a cheap childs game the functionality became nonsensical and it made going back to bc1 such a pleasure i can't imagine what the developers were thinking when making such changes after using bc1 for so long i had high hopes for its future development but alas it not to be these days i'm looking elsewhere
__label__4 i love this app i tried many to do list apps but this is the one that meets my satisfaction i guess the basic features are good just right but i'll give it 4 stars since i'm still finding something i myself can't say and it's not here maybe it's in the premium version but i'm broke as hell and i can't afford to pay for it because i have other expenses i do hope that some other features would someday be free it'll be really helpful
__label__3 it's finally getting better although still doesn't measure up to wunderlist but the latest update broke the widget please fix
__label__3 i like the app but i'm not getting notifications of reminders have checked all the settings might be that my phone's too old to be fully compatible
__label__2 coming from wunderlist todo it's annoying to use adding items to a list used to be quick and simple ms over complicated it
__label__4 wanted vertical and horizontal in routines like before and not to display that alarm clock thank you for your feedback i love it
__label__3 the app is very good but it keep crashing from time to time and i have to reinstall the app please look into this
__label__4 quite adequate for reminders simple and easy to use
__label__3 my personal experience with the app makes me say this is deforme designed more as a task management app than a habit tracking app the two things i want to do when building a new habit are 1 easily enter the stats for the habits i'm tracking and 2 see the timeline of the habit growth in a snapshot or as a dashboard this app focuses on today's tasks so getting to the specific habits entering information for another day and charting progress are too cumbersome
__label__3 it does what it says and does it beautifully would have given it a 5 star if it would have been all free but it definately makes the life easy would easily recommend it to my friends and family
__label__5 best productivity app ever
__label__3 nice but the price is soo high for this
__label__1 bad experience the support is the worst ever and no thought has been put except for the visual ui the ux is bad
__label__3 after the update widget stopped reacting but after deleting it and reinstalling it worked again and then came back to same problem
__label__3 it's really good but i think forest should add more sturdy music because it can really help
__label__5 this is my favourite app the plants are so cute and it really makes me so motivated to study i am also very happy with the tags but i have a question if i am going to change to a new phone but with the same sd card will all my plants be gone
__label__3 i love the app but sometimes the widget just freezes
__label__5 love it hope the team keeps developing this and into web app one day
__label__5 classy and useful it tied in with my calander with ease i like the look and i like seeing it in my screen it really is a simple way to see what you have going for the day quickly
__label__2 i immediately encountered a problem when i began by misclicking on one of my habits there's no way to correct for that manually change the values yes but the xp and hp don't change to reflect that automatically secondly the settings page is broken on my s9 and the issue is difficult to describe the display freezes so if you scroll an instance of the text moves while the another is stuck below honestly the tutorial really needs work i could go on but space constraints
__label__3 unfortunately the free version does not provide enough functionality for me i am trying to track habits but it stopped me at 7
__label__3 сильно не хватает возможности поделиться списком например покупок с семей
__label__2 not worth when i use other apps it keeps the timer on what's the reason behind it god knows i can't even get other species of plant as bcoz as soon as i try to do so it shows 'the forest app has stopped' and just after a second if i reopen the app then except for this function of get other species other every function i can perform
__label__5 and very concise app for making perfect timetables
__label__2 not able to install on more than two devices i found this frustrating as i had one phone stolen and another broke now i can t download on my new phone because it s already on the other with my main email does not allow another email not too pleased about this
__label__1 stop charging people for things that are simple just use onenote buy a great planner on amazon copy the template and save your money
__label__1 this app sucks if you dont have the pro version i only had for a few min and couldn't do more than add a task i tried to add an event and wanted to sync chromebook to cell but it wouldn't let me
__label__2 does not support more than only one outlook calendar
__label__5 i love this app
__label__3 i already have a subscription it's ridiculous that it notices i already had a free trial so it obviously knows my account but its not logging me in with my premium subscription to top it off i can't ask customer service nothing because it's not an option unless you have the premium that's ridiculous
__label__3 overall i like this app and i am wondering if i should pay for the premium version because there are serious limitations on the free one no notes or labels but there is one thing that annoys me the impossibly to control the view settings it would be better if they had options to change the size of panels and size of fonts and smaller spacing between each entry it would allow for a better overall view and or permit to view more things at once and reduce wasted space of the left sidebar
__label__3 good app and i like the setups that are already prepared for when u log in my problem with the app is that it's too overwhelming too many things to manage and for my easily distracted and anxious brain it's too much as constructive that can actually be applied please make it so the tasks actually leave the list ocne they are completed some are infinite and its difficult to focus on what needs to be done otherwise good job on this app it's well made
__label__5 amazing planner i've been using the desktop version linked with my google calendar and it was working great now with the app it's even better than i thought it would be i love having all of my appointments in one place and it's so easy to use i especially enjoy the extra feature of being able to add notes to my tasks it has helped me stay on task with work cleaning and everything else
__label__3 its ok looks great sends reminders a couple of features available in free version cannot add hyperlinks constant push to upgrade additional comment in regards to developer respons how can i add hyperlink in notes seems like it can only be stored as text
__label__2 i would love this app only if the notifications work at all there were no alarms or notifications or pop ups showing in my oppo f5 i tried tinkering with the system like what was said in the troubleshooting page so may times yet nothing worked would give 5 if i do not have this issue
__label__4 this would have been a 5 star to app if it wasnt for one miner problem i didn't like you can't choose pm or am times and it's just a annoying and confusing
__label__5 easy to use for a big family
__label__4 i would love to do a one life time purchase for this app too bad i hate subscription based so sorry i'd rather spend my money for something unproductive than this app
__label__3 can you fix google fit integration use their movement points
__label__2 unable to delete a list there are no 3 dots on the top right hand side of my screen i dont have all the features it says it has i loved my wunderlist and tranferred everything to microsoft to do not sure i will keep it looking for other options
__label__3 it just opens a calender so i'm not sure why i need something between me and my regular calendar app
__label__3 i like the idea of this app i already purchase the pro version but some blacklisted app still unable to wither the tree when i open it from notification such as line and whatsapp also when i opened game there is no floating banner that warn me to go back to the forest app
__label__4 can construct reminders well with an in depth layout
__label__4 liked the setup so much that i quickly became a premium user the widget alone is worth it i love the flexibility the app allows in specifying when i can work on developing a habit as i am frequently adding habits i would like to rearrange habits in the list to make it easier to find them hopefully this is an easy fix then this will be a 5 star app
__label__4 simple easy to use makes it very easy to keep track of habits
__label__4 very good calendar syncs well easy to use just wish it had grouping option so i can tell what sort of appointment i have at a glance apart from that very good
__label__4 i love this app it's the only one i've found which combines tasks and habits in a simple way however i do get frustrated that i can't seem to change the scheduling of a habit after i've set it up e g if it's set for once a week and i want to make it twice i have to delete it and create a new one can you please fix this
__label__4 just downloaded the app and noticed that i cant have 2 events overlapping eachother my example is to be in the office for my job and do schoolwork but i categorize these as two different events and want to be able to see them as such so i know everything i am doing please add this
__label__1 i hate to say but ur app sucks it automatically stops and deletes a tree or seed score it hangs and even crashes so many times i can't even contact you for support i spend 600 s from 1146 s left with 546 which got automatically deducted to 200 i mean how on earth this is happening
__label__2 there's a bug with the planning view you can't see the title of the event other than that the app runs okay
__label__3 hi stephen i was getting used to using this instead of the late inbox reminders but some repeat reminders just aren't coming up anymore high reviews and great until it wasn't great there should be an option to make recurring task reminders to not have due dates it should come up and i can clear it without removing the reminder from showing up due to needing to move out the due date can there be just an option to make a task not have a due date and make it recurring every so often thanks
__label__5 perfect for my to do list easy to use and does what it says on the tin
__label__2 absolutely no mention of paying to use this app until you've downloaded it and signed up too bad it looked pretty
__label__5 the best app of its kind hands down the only thing i would improve is the reminder system right now the app would send you a notification to complete a habit task even after you've already done it when in my opinion it should automatically turn off it's a minor thing but it tends to get a bit silly when you've completed a lot of tasks ahead of schedule other than that it's perfect
__label__1 a negative experience i wasn't using it and forgot about it until it was renewing i didn't port it over to a new phone and it seems you can't cancel the app except through the app this means i would have to install it on my new phone give it permission to access my information then cancel the subscription and uninstall it other apps on my phone with subscriptions i can cancel through google play apparently not this one
__label__4 i love this format only thing that would make it better is some form of active side scrolling gameplay element build your character throughout the week and then try to beat a level sort of thing
__label__4 i like the app a lot but some features are a little annoying i have a few suggestions more ways to tweak what the widgets look like currently they take up a lot of space it would be nice to see the completed tasks together with active tasks instead of them disappearing task subcategories please biggest gripe because of the way the entire list item is like a button i keep accidentally checking tasks that weren't actually done bugged unchecking pls fix thanks
__label__2 i really enjoyed this app but now if i delete a daily reminder i still get the notification for it which is highly annoying please fix this it distracts me from my work each time i here my notification go off for a deleted reminder
__label__4 good enaught
__label__3 im so confused with this app
__label__1 it used to be the best calendar for many years till now when annoying advertisements are popping up all the time so sad but it's totally intolerable need to uninstall and find another app
__label__1 key functionalities of the app are hidden behind a subscription of 6 50 per month with the best deal simply shameless
__label__3 36 for premium and they won't even respond to my email for technical help whatever i figured it out good app no help
__label__4 heyyy dear developers love the app but have a issue in it idk if it is only with me the app doesn't show any reminder after 1 day of setting a habit goal only 1st day it does
__label__1 in microsoft todo there is no such option like in wunderlist to comment on assigned task with others and others can get notification on their mail kindly add the feature if possible
__label__5 a really cute app great for keeping track of your focus
__label__2 i have to agree that the full screen time draining ads are not viable for a business calendar regardless of the reasoning behind it by all means keep the small rolling ads along the bottom of the screen or alternatively charge a more reasonable fee to go pro 6 is not an option when there are so many other options out there such as acal which i used to use before bc and am now reverting to i'll keep an eye on business calendar though because if you change the ad situation or make the pro price more reasonable i'll certainly be back
__label__3 great app and well thought of love the wear os integration however paying for the full version i wish there was more customizable options such as custom background or custom font for the numbers would be great to include that
__label__1 real hassle to set up with synchronization with others i cannot work out what the small red number on the icon relates to and cannot get rid of it with wunderlist it related to completed tasks and once these were viewed the number disappeared i much preferred wunderlist which worked fine why won't microsoft leave well alone i do not need this app to run my life just keep lists which can be mine or shared
__label__5 this is my dream calendar app it works perfectly with my google calendar while also offering list making capabilities as well as meal planning as a mom and business owner it gives me everything i need in a digital calendar
"__label__3 love the interface great smartwatch integration but cant change the color 
palette for some reason tried reinstalling and resetting app no luck"
__label__5 this one person has give me the most used app i have super customizable to fit most needs it has helped me stay focused on my goal more than any other i recommend this app to everyone i know
__label__4 helpful for planning
__label__2 the widget list is always glitching and won't show the items on my list won't allow me to add new items to the list the only way i seem to be able to fix this issue is by removing the widget and then putting it back in this was never an issue in the past before i upgraded to the microsoft todo i'm using a note10 and my wife on a samsung galaxy s10 has the same issue hope this can be fixed it's getting really annoying
__label__1 best free calendar is now unacceptable with full audio full screen video ads the price to avoid the ad mugging is ridiculously too much uninstalled and looking for another
__label__3 how do i set a daily weekly repeating task
__label__1 its a great app i used for years i was ok with ads but the full screen can't be immediately banished ads make it unusable when i need calendar info i need it right now i'll give it a couple of weeks but if it doesn't go back to discrete corner ads i'm out edit post response i'd have paid a couple of bucks for ad free version because it is better than stock calendar but its not 7 bucks better so if you're not going to remove full screen ads after years of using gotta say buh bye
__label__3 has many nice features but they lack polish 1 has notifications like ticktick but unlike ticktick you'll have to unlock the phone for you to see it 2 has a grocery list where you can add things but you cannot add quantity and many others
__label__4 the widgets look great and i like the idea behind this app but it feels like im fighting it to create goals where i would have to start over completely to make it a single task vs a quantity also my biggest issue is that you cant set a quantity per week only per day i want to be able to set x number of hours per week doing a task without any daily requirements
__label__4 it is helpful
__label__4 widget not working correctly when updating the date of task to future date it still shows in today task
__label__3 i used this app a few times but now facebook login won't work it'd be a better app if you could just sync it with your google account
__label__5 excellent if you use it properly the only thing i would change is the notification and alarms settings i want notifications to come through even when i'm not actively looking at the app right now i'm not notified until i open the app and the pop ups show up
__label__3 fix permissions for 5 stars great design and ui but you shouldn't need access to my contacts to login with my google account google provides an api for it that all other apps use without contacts permissions
__label__3 i think the app is very good has helped me to keep track of my habits however i wish there was a function whereby you could postpone a habit for something out of your control i e not going to the gym because you're on holiday this although a break from the habit doesn't feel like it should affect the moments when you are focused and in control of keeping the habit also how is the success percentage measured if you only have to do the habit a certain number of times a week
__label__3 app crash often happens and i cant even open the app so how am i going to send a bug report
__label__5 very useful
__label__3 good app the way subtasks are structured are a pain in the ass though
__label__4 it is better to have more choices in time repeat like i want do some jobs in some days of week wendsday sunday and monday
__label__2 is there no way to assign a specific color to an event i like to group my meetings by color if i can't do that the app isn't useful for me
__label__1 this app isn't optimized for use it's just a concept for example the alarm plays music but can't be shut off there's no acknowledge alarm so if it starts paying music yeah it never stops this is only one of many bugs so bad it breaks the app don't waste your time
__label__3 been a paid member for years they've been completely frozen in time features people have begged for years have been ignored or if they do it takes them years to implement had to wait years just for dark mode i saw a blog post on their site where the project manager boasts about travelling full time in his car with his family explains a lot really they've really let their once loyal users down hopefully another app comes along and eats their lunch because it's there for the taking
__label__3 i used to really love this app and i still do for its flexibility and functionality i was considering getting the pro version but because i am a small business owner it was not yet necessary since the recent change to the new add format i am watching full screen adds and waiting for them to finish oftentimes no skip option the adds are so obnoxious that the first time it appeared i tought i was hacked it's hampering my productivity and now it has also put me off getting the pro version
__label__3 wonderful when it works i have written them and never heard back i bought the full version because i really like the calendar i love that i can see many of my monthly entries on the full month widget view i do not love that it crashes a couple times a day and i have to delete and add the widget again especially since it seems to always happen when on in front of someone making an appointment smh please fix update4dev i did not receive email i just resent email which contains info
__label__2 no monthly recurring reminder features can't even remind me when to pay the bills
__label__3 the creating of tasks is pretty straightforward and easy to use but i don't like the idea that tasks in filters are the same copy of tasks in lists sometimes i change my mind with which tasks and lists go to which filters and if i want to remove the filter then it deletes all the tasks within it as well i want to be able to delete the filter without having to delete the tasks themselves entirely
__label__4 can sync it to laptop
__label__3 very nice looking the pricing is just right and i love that you can have subtasks upon subtasks but almost nothing about it is intuitive for an app that is all about helping the user be more productive to have a new or occasional user blundering around poking and prodding until the app lets them accomplish basic tasks well that is obviously detrimental to productivity and a surefire way to accidentally encourage customer churn ux test your app please
__label__1 cant even understand how to use it didnt like at all
__label__3 it would be good if it was a free app i understand in app purchases but only if the app itself was free
__label__3 troublesome widget organization when i tap a date it opens app to date previously open not new date needed very time consuming and creates booking mistakes when not careful
__label__5 good app kudos to the developers बह त बढ़ य भ ई
__label__3 the app is good and i've switched to it from ticktick but then i switched to microsoft todo because of the design mainly but that's not the only thing don't get me wrong it works but there are way to many features that are premium at least make the reminders a free feature because that is just absurd maybe fix the design add an all black theme and make the reminders a free feature but all in all it's great
__label__4 everything is pretty much amazing but it should have a note tab without checkboxes where we can put important note not task
__label__1 note to self the demo version of this app is totally useless so there is no way of knowing if this product will be able to meet my needs before paying for the premium version i'll find another way to get my needs met i'm sure there are other products available for free that would do the same things since i'm not allowed to testdrive all the bells and whistles i am passing this app over no thanks uninstalling
__label__4 good app with notifications for reminding you and helping you track your progress
__label__5 it took 5 different apps to find this one everyone lacked in some major way be it reminders the interface or the way it was organized this is by far the best lacking occurrences option is limited to one one occurance on andriod need more grouping lists under a single name aka history math science under school for things to be arranged by time with unschulded things at bottom of today or tomorrow columns to schedule later and importance urgency ratings on tasks amazin app
__label__1 the app itself is great i used it quite regularly a few years back but when i tried to use it again it seems that the 'new' owners don't acknowledge their 'lifetime' subscription sure hope my emails get more results besides ignore kthnxbye sent an email they said they opened a ticket and then crickets nice thanks downgraded to
__label__5 i have thoroughly enjoyed my aa ever since i found out about last year i had been looking for an organizer that i use as a calendar and to handle my many things to do lists thank you katy for your vision and concept
__label__2 recurring tasks are behind a pay wall ridiculous to have to pay a monthly subscription for such a simple feature app is a little ugly and not customisable
__label__2 i have read quite a bit about updates being frustrating before applying the update i had hoped to find documentation about changes found nothing on the todoist website no comments in reviews update is attempting to be pushed where's the documentation
__label__2 doesn't show a content of reminder on locked screen even if its correctly set in the settings fix it and i'll change my rate btw google calendar knows how to wake up a locked screen and show notifications
__label__3 at times it doesn't even buzz or come up on my phone that i had a task to complete i'm not sure if this is just my phone though
__label__2 has been one of the best reminder app available for a long time this most recent update messed up notifications on android 10 they don't follow the system dark mode at all instead you have to manually change it in the app or deal with mismatched colors it looks ridiculous seeing a white notification background amidst other black backgrounds in dark mode it also looks like the black is not a true black like other apps if this isn't fixed soon i'll be looking for a new reminder app
__label__4 simple easy to use makes it very easy to keep track of habits
__label__4 good could be better i can not find where you can have a task repeat every week month year
__label__1 updating my previous review i recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits yet the app only shows me of having 30 days this is the same bug i reported last year it appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the new year i've reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone i'm giving up on this app and suggest you do too i've used this for a couple of years there was a bug where one week of my tracking wasn't recognized by the app this happened the week of new years i reached out to the developer five times about it and never heard back unfortunately this has become an unreliable app for tracking
__label__3 hvn try
__label__1 good app but no updates even after sending few suggestions what is the point in buying paid version
__label__5 simply put perfect the free version is already amazing i can only imagine how great the premium version is
__label__3 too costly
__label__3 i love this app the only thing that would make me like it more would be if the text wrapping on the sections made more sense sometimes the titles of my events get cut off and placed in odd spots in the sectors also i've found the colors are very limited when it looks into my calendar to match the color my calendar has for events it gets it wrong or doesn't have the color
__label__3 i love this app so far but the notifications are not really working for me
__label__1 no reminders
__label__1 i reported about this app due to incorrect billing but noone answer me please return my money back because app took my money without my permission from my credit card
__label__2 tried to plan my weekly schedule with the routines function but it kept randomly changing the times of the events as i made other edits for example an event i set for 4pm changed to 11am when i hit the button add break before event also annoying that you can't preview the notification sounds and have to add silly tags to each event such as housework
__label__3 so i really like this app probably one of the best planner apps out there but i ended up uninstalling it because it kept asking to pair with my google account and the pop up was rather aggressive the cancel button didn't work and it would pop up after every single action even after going to the settings to try to sync it with my account i didn't see a way to sync it i do really love this app it's great but that pop up just ruined it
__label__2 wonderful app with nice visual hierarchy but now ads take over the entire screen
__label__5 just overall a great app if you want to become more concious about your daily habits and of course it's very helpful to create new habits erase unwanted ones the paid version is gonna be a necessary upgrade if you want to keep track of lots of things but it's totally worth it
__label__5 though it started bland sometime ago to do is getting better and better i find myself using it more and more as it is very convenient for me in my microsoft ecosystem developers are also responding well for user feedback and ideas for improvements
__label__4 very helpful i can see what i have accomplished and organize my week with what i want to do
__label__2 not much use
__label__3 i was like great wit it until it erased all my schedules then like magic gave em back 4 that month
__label__1 i use to love this app it is the perfect organizer with great features however for the last month it barely opens i am lucky if it will actually open twice a day the app will say not responding opens to a black page or doesn't do anything but freeze my phone momentarily my life is saved into this app so i am so frustrated
__label__1 i don't understand why do i have to turn on the screen when i grow up the tree when my screen turns off because of inactivity for 10 minutes tree dies again i installed this app to focus on my work not my phone but this app keeps requiring me to turn on the phone it's paradoxical
__label__2 very buggy first few times that i've used the app repeatedly having to close and reopen it for it to properly work
__label__4 just the best this app has helped me improve at a time i was feeling very down and unable to do anything i only wish the notifications worked better
__label__4 it is really a useful app and i liked it but i have a proplem that my tree doesn't die when i leave the app it actually blocks me from using apps but when i remove it from the background tapping the right button and remove it by scrolling up i can open any app and forest stops working what i want exacly is to make my tree die when i leave forest and never be able to use apps when i try to do so during focusing time please tell me if there is any solution for this and thank you so much
__label__4 i like how it gives a different visual of my schedule the only thing i would do differently is make it scalable for phones it doesn't expand to the boundary box like it should when resizing
__label__5 i love that all my calendars are integrated in one spot work school kids small business its pretty functional tracks meals to dos and water intake i'm thrilled to have something pretty to add joy to my day thanks beta team
__label__3 i've been using habitica for a few years now and while i love the idea from a technical standpoint the mobile app is broken it feels like something you would have on your phone back when touchscreens were a new thing the most annoying bugs are party screen not updating after you accept a quest invitation so you're not sure if you accepted it spamming buffs sometimes reduces your mana without actually applying the buff and party chat not updating have to restart the app to see new messages
__label__1 no reminders in free version how do you expect to compete with other todo apps if your free version is useless subscription models suck
__label__2 i used to really love this app but lately it won't notify me when the timer is up it's hard to keep track of how much you're working
__label__5 great app
__label__1 not felt user friendly
__label__5 a boost in habit formation
__label__4 fun and easy to use creative and helpful way to track tasks and habits
__label__5 i've tested dozens of habit and routine tracking apps the clean layout useful widgets and versatility of this one puts it above the rest even without premium it is highly functional furthermore premium is a one time purchase rather then a monthly annual fee which was a deciding factor for me
__label__5 really easy to use task manager ability to schedule posts and get alerts when you're over due great layout in projects or per week ability to add links emails and subtasks made my work life a lot easier
__label__3 it's ok but i wish i could move activities around in a routine instead of having to manually change the time one by one e g if i have yoga 9 10 then study 10 12 and want to swap them i can't just move around the blocks i have to delete study change the time of yoga then add study with the new time it's time consuming and not practical would also be good to be able to change settings of a routine e g from 4 days to 2 instead of deleting the entire routine and start over
__label__2 seriously how did it get a 4 8 i can't even find an add button anywhere unless i go to the top left corner nah not for me
__label__5 lovely
__label__1 keeps crashing before i can even sign in
__label__3 doesn't open in weekly view even though i have it set to do so color scheme could be more attractive or a greater variety of colors provided to choose from when you like or dislike a motivational quote it disappears forever so if you really like one you should never rate it community discussion forum is a nice concept but there are no dates on the posts so i have no idea how old they are otherwise it's a good tracking app
__label__5 really helpful app insane widget
__label__3 it's not bad but it seems greedy like why do i have to pay to unlock individual color themes if i'm paying a monthly subscription also liferpg was so much better than this more icons to choose from and they were free if you're going to make an app that copies all the ideas from liferpg at least make it better why can't i make an accomplishment like learned blank piece of music without having to tie it to accomplishing a certain number of tasks or reaching a certain level
__label__3 sound now works but when i have the phone's do not disturb feature on my wake up alarm task notifies but no sound i have it set to ignore do not disturb and have it set to alarm my other alarm app does sound off during this time but not as reliable as task so it's not my phone causing no sound issue what else could it be stephen you get it working and you get 4 stars restore still does not work gave up on that
__label__1 notification not working
__label__5 this app is so simple yet effective i've been using it on and off for five years now and i always seem to come back to it when i really need to focus there are a couple of hiccups with the app but i've still given it five stars as these don't really take away from how great it is
__label__5 i swear it deserves more than 5 stars it totally deserves infinite stars i luv this app it really helps me with my exams and studying whilst making me do other things like guitar and daily planning really love this app
__label__3 it works great i love the simplicity and ease of use but there seems to be a glitch there are dots on days where i have no events or tasks listed i can't get rid of them and they are not linked to my google calender either
__label__5 great app
__label__4 it's an excellent app but i would ditch the ads you shouldn't need theme with a premium version available they make your app look cheap and distract users
__label__1 needlessly compicated for a to do list app try to add a new item to your list and youll accidentally add a new list try to swipe to switch between lists and youll remove an item from your list what did you just remove hard to say cant seem to find an undo option among the numerous other options
__label__4 it's amazing i just wish there was goals and categories for tasks
__label__3 no doubt this is a great app but it is now causing errors app crashes all the time when i completed my first session of study now i am facing very much problem kindly work on this issue
__label__5 easy to set up and daily tracking is very simple visual display is great if a habit is set for every other day or with some other gap in between the app shows a chain with open circles rather than solidly colored circles likewise if the goal is a specific number of minutes or repetitions it color codes the entry differently depending on whether you met or did fewer reps than the goal only using the free app for now but plan to upgrade
__label__1 absolutely worthless this app runs a prohibitively clunky interface that effectively voids the promise of ease of life automation google calendar will provide all other services promised by any do for free with no annual subscription rate don't sign up for the free trial it's not worth getting pinged for forty bucks when you decide you don't like it and forget to cancel it in time save your money
__label__2 it works well but i do not recall subscribing to a 28 year subscription i thought i purchased it until i saw that it was renewed for an additional 28 it's not good enough to justify that price
__label__1 this used to be a very good calendar app with plenty of good features in the free version already unfortunately they introduced intrusive full screen ads recently to force you into buying the premium version i'll rather switch to another calendar app than be blackmailed like that
__label__4 i subscribed for premium because i feel it's nice could you tell me where to check the status report and how to re organize the habits freely without any sorting order thanks edit please add option for statistics tab separately and need to work on showing them correctly on average
__label__4 love this app helps me a lot
__label__1 way to screw up a great app microsoft
__label__3 so far todoist has worked fine but the fact they want you to pay a monthly fee to set a reminder is ridiculous so many times i'm in the middle of something and can't finish a task right then and i want to be able to set a reminder time to move on to another app
__label__1 i just paid for premium as i was told by the app developers that it would enable me to sync my data from my old android phone onto my new android phone but it fails everytime i click 'sync' i sent the developers my feedback but they won't get back to me
__label__3 just started using it a little triki to configure at first
__label__5 i am a vanilla habitician but that game failed to serve it's purpose several times and i eventually quit i linked it to several systemic errors i was even thinking about creating my own habit rpg free of those but then i found do it now not only it answers all of my concerns it even adds more features like drawbacks for completing certain tasks anti procrastinator or putting player in position where he has to maintain his characteristics amazing thank you devs please port it to web
__label__1 immediately wants me to buy the full version of the app while the demo part is not even that nice
__label__5 great integration on google apps especially calendar attachs pictures allows you to prioritize great to have my friends have been asking how do you remember everything it's proplanner
__label__4 not used the premium yet
__label__2 like the look but it messes up straight away instead of saving an entry the app cashed and deleted it instead don't get
__label__5 great app combining the calendar tasks and grocery list make it so much easier to handle and manage my time day
__label__1 this app concept and idea is really good but it does not work well i paid already but it does not function i even ask the pic person in charge but she took forever to reply
__label__5 very good app
__label__4 a great way to get organized and remember your to do list
__label__2 it was pretty good on my old phone then when everything was ported to my new one the app came but not the lists i'd made what's the point of that i've deleted it
__label__5 really versatile app got the premium version almost immediately very easy to use love dark theme not invasive and doesn't cause anxiety with pending habits tasks i'd like to see a feature added to make daily notes for each habit and one to let you chose the icon for 'other' category habits
__label__5 brilliant app must try and never uninstall
__label__4 this app is great but i have some suggestions that would even better improve the quality of using the app for example something like being able to edit the tasks widgets to show 'due soon' instead of just tasks for that day for even better planning
__label__4 thus far i'm finding to do useful it feels a step up from wunderlist time will tell for sure
__label__4 1 week in not bad somewhat intuituve i like this app so far for its thoughtful blend of simplicity and intuitive features that go beyond being a task list more into routine habits some important features are hard to find or change after initial set up my day planning activity 'anydo moment' i could not find all week to modify so it was starting this important step at a difficult time of day to use many simmilar apps aim claim to be useful but only achieve novelty
__label__3 it's been more than a year since i've requested a simple feature of counting the number of hours for certain entries in a month but there's nothing yet
__label__1 i had to migrate from wunderlist and i mentioned a couple of compromises that had to be made due to less functionality anyway today i discover that you cannot print or email your lists surely those are basic requirements this should have been thought out and a replacement system should at least be on par with the system its replacing
__label__4 to do list works good but it is no idiot proof developer needs to add more walk through instructions at start when the app is downloaded when people commit on issues the developer replies offended but the developer did not make a idiot proof way of solving these problems that a newbie with little patience would have instead they lash out its not the user's fault its the developer fault for not understanding the concept of idiot proofing a sound product face it people don't read
__label__2 galaxy s10 on android 10 ftue is busted first two slides don't load you get to the character creation and the avatar and all of the customize options are invisible don't display please fix or mark the app as incompatible with android 10
__label__5 extremely appropriate for those who enjoy time management
__label__4 i have looked and looked for an app that would let me make lists and check them off like pen and paper and this does that simple and great to use
__label__3 i paid for this app now they have forced ads on me i would like a refund
__label__4 seems like a very good idea but how can i edit what i've done the previous day eg if its tuesday it seems to be impossible to edit achievements from monday which seems like a perfect thing do to on tuesday morning
__label__4 good application
__label__1 i downloaded this app because i thought that the game concept for to do lists would be really cool opened the app just after downloading and tried to register an account and it wouldn't let me log in waited another hour and it still wasn't working call me impatient but i just couldn't use an app that refused to work
__label__5 i've only been using this app for a week so take this with a gain of salt i've never been someone who could stick to a routine this app is great because i can configure it to get in my face about what i'm supposed to be doing the pop up the voice notification the persistent icon in my status bar work together to get my lazy butt on track
__label__2 this an amazing calender my only problem was i was looking for a calendar for solely for my business because this app you must sync your calendar it becomes useless because now you have your personal calendar mix with business useless for that purpose i can just use my google calendar
__label__2 uninstalled when i saw the app wanted me to pay a subscription fee as ransom for my data i never will
__label__3 app crash often happens and i cant even open the app so how am i going to send a bug report
__label__1 couldn't even create a log in
__label__3 it's very basic why doesn't it have a calendar view if i want to take a look at my week overall nice interface though
"__label__3 kindly add selection ringtones for alarm there should be an option to 
select alarm and the ringtone you want"
__label__3 good
__label__3 i'd really like to use this app but there's no option to sync with other calendar services like microsoft's
__label__2 have difficulty syncing to google calendar
__label__3 it's good but it's size is large
__label__2 without syncing to the cloud this todo app is unfortunately worthless love it otherwise and would have given it 4 or 5 stars please add sync since in my quest to find a good todo app this is the only one i've seen that doesn't sync anywhere between devices
__label__2 the font size is realy small and you can't change it without paying for the full version large font is a basic accessibility feature it shouldn't cost extra
__label__3 decent app but not worthy of monthly fees what happened to 1x pro licenses
__label__4 it's a good start but i miss some of the simple capability of wunderlist
__label__5 the most user friendly to do list i've ever had and i've tried a few i love the colour coding of each list the push notifications which you can snooze for various amounts of time are spot on it's definitely worth trying this if you want to get organised with ease now i've been using it for a couple of weeks i have one thing that would be useful it would be even more awesome if the snooze options included something specific such as 'tomorrow 8am' 'tomorrow 6pm' still an amazing app
__label__5 this app is actually really handy it really keeps me motivated i would highly reccomend this app to anyone that has trouble staying organized
__label__4 i love this widget it's such a clear picture of the time and schedule my only thing is i wish it was compatible for the galaxy watch i got the app because i saw it on the watch i'm the pictures but it doesn't work with the galaxy watch if this was improved to work with the watch i would give it 5 stars
__label__3 good
__label__3 i have been using this app ever since i switched to an android phone 5 6 years ago and i have liked it for the most part however the recent addition of the focus button in the pop up reminder bar is annoying focus is only available in the premium version and there's no way to turn it off time to shop for a new to do list app
__label__5 perfect for what it needs to do
__label__3 i am kind of sad that we are not able to choose where to put the tree on the terraine other than that the app seems great also would be interesting to have the actual forest overview as a widget on your display
__label__4 very nice app with a lot of integrations which makes it very comfortable to use although i think some features are missing e g grouping by project in a filtered view
__label__5 realistic approach on time management
__label__3 awesome
__label__2 due date is wonky i made a few items on my list and the due will not change from the current day the due date worked on other items i don't need another app to work around
__label__2 the layout was good but it only lets you track 5 habits for free
__label__3 paid app
__label__3 useful
__label__2 wish it didn't force me to use google calendar i wanted to start a new calender off of this app
__label__3 why there isn't a automatic completed task deleter like feature
__label__5 this app is so cool it really helps me to motivate my self and i love the sounds it does in the background highly reccomend
__label__2 really weird formatting i'm trying to be more organized not get a brain workout trying to figure out an app
__label__3 after the new update i cannot plant the new tree real tree
__label__3 does exactly one thing tracks habits but does it well and without pointless bloaty extras or ads clean interface sadly app seems to have been abandoned by developers and premium features like sync no longer work no way to transfer data
__label__3 have not fully tried this app yet but the images and graphical user interface is appealing to me hopefully this app would be able to meet my requirements in my daily life chores
__label__4 i really love the app but i have one suggestion though i hope you make the trees animated so users can have a better experience and enjoy their forest more nevertheless this app is
__label__4 the app has a way of motivating you to complete tasks
__label__3 got this loved the free version paid 3 99 for pro and still don't have the ability or can't figure out how and there are no instructions to set different calendars on two widgets on my phone i'll be happy to give you 5 stars if you send me a how to also it says there is time tracking does that mean i should be able to do a start stop on something while i'm doing an activity
__label__2 the ui is not attractive to begin with text overlap and the fact that the only screen orientation available is landscape immediately turned me off to the app the layout is not bad and puts all the information right in front of you but it looks as if it was built for windows 98 i certainly was not willing to pay for the full version when the free version was so flawed i can find better free apps with more functionality than the paid version of this one it needs some work
__label__3 decent app but not worthy of monthly fees what happened to 1x pro licenses
__label__2 i loved this app but after the new update i am unable to use the widget uninstalled
__label__2 don't know how to use
__label__1 only option is paid subsctiption app no thanks i can't constantly pay for apps within my budget so i'd much rather have the option to use a version with ads
__label__3 interesting concept to improve productivity whenever i click on a link and come back to the app i am unable to view contents in the app
__label__5 simple works and its reliable
__label__4 very easy to use plus best time route app available
__label__3 there needs to be a feature to purge completed tasks its cumbersome to to have to delete them one by one or by selected all and deselecting the upcoming tasks potential to delete active tasks
__label__4 i'm still getting my way around the app functions so far its proving its worth like to find a way to connect to alarms n reminders
__label__1 1 tips on how to study efficiently and effectively 2 before planting a tree add a button wherein you should finalize the tag that is set 3 if the tag is changed during the planting process it should reflect separately the time spent by the previous tag as well as that of the new tag so that the overall distribution is at its peak accuracy will put 5 stars afterwards
__label__5 good job
__label__2 you should be able to add to the particular list you are viewing from the and not have to change it from task every time it works as it should once in a while
__label__2 how does it work
__label__2 i've spent hours on it already and i'm just not getting it looks like most tutorials are for an older version can't figure out how to create shorter than 7 day routines what's the difference between a routine and an event etc
__label__3 updated was confused that the event list in the actual app wasn't showing events scheduled for the next few days the widget will only show events in the next 12h the event list in the app also only shows events in the next 12h i think this list should list events for that entire day this means i still depend on other apps for an agenda view
__label__3 scary it's a great program haven't put enough into it to see if it has the gtasks sync issues but i don't see a backup option i've put information into apps then years later they change formats and all data is lost this can never happen i need to know that i can always access a given version of the program and local data will always work todo and microsoft onenote burned me microsoft is extorting buy office 365 and we'll allow you access to your prior data
__label__3 this planner has a beautiful ui but lacks the ability to sync tasks anywhere plus the tasks need to be able to mark as completed from the widget in any case i use my planner to keep track of it all i may lose my phone then what i won't know what to do out where to go tasks need to sync and not with purple planner with google
__label__2 great
__label__4 it's user friendly and can be personalised very efficiently but i am currently having issues with it overlapping with the built in google calendar it didn't use to i keep that for personal use and this one for business obviously but now they both sync and show the same things whichever calendar i select so i cannot use them differently i hope there is a way around this otherwise i will have to download a replacement
__label__3 the event didnt sync to my other device
__label__3 please add a transparent widet swipe to finish tasks would also be nice it would be really great if we could add comments to individual tasks
__label__2 came over from wunderlist and i was not happy with the changes i have sync errors all the time my lists are doubbled up the ones i had shared with others and when i add a new task to any list they go to the bottom at the list so i have to manualy drag them uppwards and if i change it so that it goes to the top of the list the app wont let you drag organise the list this app is just bugs bugs and glitches so in short make it more like wunderlist but ok app otherwise
__label__4 great user interface easy to use syncing with google calendar is a huge advantage from to do lists to events you can schedule anything
__label__2 refreshing tasks is a nightmare
__label__5 reached to my satisfaction
__label__4 nice app very useful
__label__2 there's no option to remove time rows in the widget only an option to remove the time bar which is kinda pointless was hoping for a simple layout for the widget to display only days 7 days without all those crowded rows of time displayed would otherwise give it a 5 star
__label__4 great app
__label__2 claims syncing but it always fails to sync lost all data when got new phone donwgrading to two stars
__label__5 wonderful app that simply shows your progress of creating habits love the visual layout that helps he stay on track
__label__5 nice app
__label__3 still lags on my kitkat version
__label__1 want to customize colors buy the pro version not a chance thanks for nothing b
__label__4 great however marking down one star as can't find a way to edit frequency of habit once you've saved it have to delete and recreate habit with new frequency
__label__1 the ads now pop up full screen that is very very very very annoying what if i'm on an important call making an appointment and then you pop up this irrelevant ad right in my face unprofessional
__label__3 still has bugs that wunderlist did not for instance the widget that i usually keep on my launcher with lists of things to do oftentimes goes blank and stops working i'm totally fine with replacing a product with a more modern offering but it needs to work properly
__label__3 i miss the today week all shortcuts that wunderlist had at the top the planned replacement is not as easy to view or follow my week ahead at a glance the automated transfer seems to have worked well so far update sharing lists previously shared with my wife now creates a double so that needs to be fixed asap wunderlist would randomly delete scheduled reminders in bulk hopefully to do has put a stop to that
__label__5 it sometimes crashes a lot
__label__5 love the app i've signed up to premium a year ago and i'm continuing my subscription i'm using the getting things done gtd methodology with this app a feature idea allow users to choose when today ends or when tomorrow starts e g my day doesn't really finish at midnight every day i consider my day finished when i go to sleep which sometimes can be at 3 4 am so i would choose 6 am to be my tomorrow so those tasks don't mess up my to do list on nights when i work late
__label__2 i'm adding a star because the import from wunderlist was seamless but otherwise the fact that i cannot drag and drop reorganize stuff manually absolutely sucks soon as i can get my lists imported into something else i'll be moving on
__label__2 bad
__label__2 updated to the latest version and the store would not load anymore plus my trees planted for the day does not record anymore
__label__4 only had a couple of days and generally good experience ties in nicely with google assistant though i cant get it to automatically set a time to remind on a task when created by voice slight niggle that when i do certain actions completing events the app jumps to mid july on the calendar no clue why but it's pretty irritating overall seems to be helpful for productivity
__label__5 helps you stay organized love it very easy to use
__label__2 must register with email google or fb displaying your email address just to get onto app smack dab near beginning of setup process full page per each setting a full page ad to buy premium version appears getting into app stayed just a min with the boxed staring at the boxed text notification that we have seven 7 days to try app for free already concerned about not liking having to register online to use stopped setup process at that page uninstalling right now
__label__5 this app has helped me keep up so many habits and routines at first i struggled with it a lot but i soon joined a party the quests are really helpful to keep me on track and there are others in the groups to help out too
__label__5 i have thoroughly enjoyed my aa ever since i found out about last year i had been looking for an organizer that i use as a calendar and to handle my many things to do lists thank you katy for your vision and concept
__label__5 great all around app free features are enough for most users though thete are some nice premium perks for upgrading love being able to create items using natural voice this app is tough to beat i keep trying other apps and always return here
__label__3 this app is great but one thing that bugs me is that it doesnt have the option to attach images to the tasks you can comment images within a task but i just wish you could directly attach them so you could see it underneath a task rather than having to click on the task then go into comments
__label__3 used it for 1 day then forgot to even open it as got into new habit it kept showing notifications and i kept ignoring it not much productive for me but app design is good
__label__3 full screen ads
__label__3 great in a lot of ways but a huge drawback is that you can't edit the start date or previous inactivated activated dates for a habit so if you've been doing a habit for a few weeks before you add it to the program you can't record those two weeks of success in the program or if you intentionally stopped a habit for a time period but didn't inactivate it during your chosen time off your percentage is dragged down
__label__4 i really wish the calendar was available for non premium members
__label__3 i really enjoy this app up until about an hour ago all of a sudden during a quest my party disappeared and my friends messaged me to ask what happened i have also tried to join a help guild to ask but the app wont let me join a guild or post in chat at all now please fix this bug so me and my friends can enjoy the app
__label__3 app itself is nice but needs a lot of polish right now it's kind of a bugfest
__label__5 excellent software i was a long time user of business calendar pro the font is a bit compressed but shows more information very well done please keep up the good efforts
__label__4 very helpful i can see what i have accomplished and organize my week with what i want to do
__label__3 nice app but would like access to a calendar without paying premium price
__label__5 perfect widget for your home screen all your events in the same place on a clock
__label__4 each of the features acts like it should only two things kept this from five stars 1 the reminder is set by default to 15 min and there is no easy way to turn that off or set it to another time 2 the events are colorless making them less at a glance for looking up your plans for the day other than those two things i've got no complaints
__label__2 windows 10 version made my computer freak out uninstalling for now
__label__3 i would like a button easy to access when i open the app in order to add a quick reminder i don't get the concept of 'my day' i find annoying that you can't set up the deadline and reminder i one go
__label__5 very useful app for keeping track of the day
__label__3 overall i enjoy this app however i just needed to call 911 and the app made me confirm more than once if i really wanted to kill the tree before i could make the call there should be an emergency kill without question button or option or something because that is not safe
__label__3 if it had reminders in free version it would have been the best to do list
__label__5 very useful and and easy to use
__label__1 i am not able to set the time it is automatically taking the remainder timing
__label__2 annoying backup system i've had installed this app and logged in with google account once i also tried some of the app's features but i uninstalled again because of reasons after some times i decided to install it again so i made my tasks and the others without logging in first because i forgot then when i logged in with my google account after that it replace my current data with the older one without warning now all my newly created more complete data is all gone
__label__2 tutorial did not explain much and too confusing to figure out the benefit of using this app
__label__3 works great easy to move unfinished tasks why the 3 because they want 3 dollars a month to review completed tasks there are others out there that don't charge
__label__5 this task app has been very helpful at organizing things that i do on a daily basis especially making list for shopping or getting gifts for friends i've never personally used location tracking so that i can list out a specific location but i'm sure that it works perfectly fine as long as your gps works as well i would definitely recommend this to those that are looking for more organization to their day 5 5 stars
__label__4 the app version has so much more to improve aside from being buggy a lot of features are still missing compared tovthe web version four stars because it helps me nonetheless i wish the team best of luck and thank you for habitica
__label__3 grocery is not working correctly i have added some things then changed their categories closed the app then opened and there was all messed up categories were messed and list was multipled some things were tripled
__label__3 i have changed my mind and have bought the 24hr clock version once the app is fully updated and is working how i want it to use i will review accordingly i have gave 3 stars as it is the middle ground for now
__label__2 desde hace unos meses no sirve la sync ni me deja entrar a la cuenta
__label__3 so close to being perfect missing tags filters reports will definitely be keeping an eye out for these
__label__3 love the content but the price is way too high for premium
__label__3 are there any guides out there
__label__4 it keeps reminding me even after the task is done and it was adjusted according to how many times i should be notified but overall nice app
__label__5 love this app just wish i could use it on my surface pro as well as my phone
__label__3 i really like the app but you need to fix the reminders they don't work it doesn't pop up on time and sometimes not at all
__label__5 best app
__label__2 i'm not interested in subscriptions one time fee would be fine by me
__label__4 i wish this would sync with my google task so that i can use it on my computer and ipad
__label__3 smooth interface but i didnt see where i can set a specific notification per schedule on my calender it has one sound for all notifications in the calender
__label__5 perfect
__label__5 respected brother very nice app premium payment must be by other means as well and your contact details
__label__4 super convenient
__label__3 love the interface and how easy and helpful it would be but the alarms i set do not not ring i gave permissions to this app already yet it doesn't edit thank you for letting me know it's a huawei power saving issue are there any work arounds the power saving mode on huawei to still allow this app to run the alarms are very important without them the app is critically impaired on my device haha thanks
__label__2 great concept but riddled with bugs sign up was horribly difficult with the servers not responding and the app failing to realize i was trying to change my username and display names app reset at around 7 00 pm instead of at midnight of my time zone which i had double checked beforehand i want to like it but this is becoming downright frustrating
__label__1 predatory ads killing it
__label__3 overall a really good app well thought however i would personally spend some time on the interface interactions it became too many steps for my preferences realizing i needed to change a bunch of tasks i had to pick a task bottom right to edit then tap below description untick termless select date click ok top right another ok top right that's too much i suggest adding swiping options to the task look at nine email as an example but overall good might return one day
__label__1 i missed my work today because of your stupid weak alarm method this means i've lost some money notification reliability should be of paramount importance if something doesn't work 100 remove it very disappointed very edit i didn't get any warning nothing if the other option is the recommended one which i hate that it adds an alarm icon in the status bar other apps work without doing this it doesn't mean the other one is not working bad i'm forced to use the stock alarm for the first event in the morning to be sure which is very inconvenient
__label__5 the best to do app ever it is so well synced with the desktop version and vice versa the ui is awesome and smooth it really feels good to use this app
__label__3 nice i really like this app this is very nice app to remind me our daily routine and save our time
__label__2 it displays awkwardly has backwards date malfunctions to a point where the widget does not display has a small central area has no 1x1 option has complicated descriptions for functionality that should be easy to understand but i can buy a widget pallet which many apps have as standard for free for 3 what's not to love
__label__3 don't know
__label__3 nice app but there is a with the tasks syncing with other calendar
__label__2 while i can understand limiting somethings for premium only i've never seen an app block widgets behind a pay wall and quite frankly this is only useful to me if i can keep track of things on the homescreen maybe i would have liked it but so far i havent used it because i keep forgetting its there
__label__1 drains a heck lot of battery
__label__2 cool concept but unusable for google business users because all of your coworkers calendars are selected by default and there's no bulk deselect all button
__label__3 waste there was not an option to set an alarm to remind i can write a note anywhere i need the note to remind me which this app said it would too busy trying to get me to but it i will just but an alarm clock
__label__3 added feature synchronizer connect added the note writing feature during the call added a feature synchronized with the mail
__label__5 the app didn't work for me at first but after uninstalling a few times it eventually worked and i love it this is great for me as a college student because it makes keeping up with homework and assignments easier by adding an element of fun
__label__4 the app has a way of motivating you to complete tasks
__label__5 great way to stay motivated and focused on useful things
__label__2 it's clear to me that this is the best todo app and i've used it for a long time but having reminders be a premium feature is just unreasonable as it's impossible to use a todo app without them i'll be switching to ticktick
__label__4 this app seems to work pretty well the user forums aren't well managed but remain useful habit tracker has never crashed on me but it does have the annoying habit of changing where in the ui has focus at the time you launch the app fortunately its easy to navigate
__label__1 what should i do if i want more sublists there is no way
__label__3 great idea and everything looks good but the top and bottom buttons are covered by navigation bar on the pixel 3 xl making it unusable couldn't even click the button to report the bug within the app so i'll change my rating once this is fixed
__label__5 bought the paid version to support the devs for making this awesome app
__label__4 no ads that's nice
__label__3 app is ok but you can't delete habits and replace with new what the f
__label__4 amazing experience
__label__4 pretty good for me but in the version i have i can't edit a task
__label__3 this is a lovely app but i would rather to pay one time off for using it it becomes too expensive if you use it for years doesn't connect to google tasks neither
__label__1 i have used this app for years but there is now a major issue if you drag a task to tomorrow or place it under a task with a later date the task date no longer changes date is there any way to revert to an earlier revision hi i have sent screenshots but the issue is the same
__label__5 this is the best app u can customize your to do list and its reminding feature can help u not 4get any of the task u have to do and it can be much more better to have ur to do list on ur phone cz it can keep u remember ur tasks
__label__3 after last update all info's gone shame on you android never more
__label__1 nic
__label__1 this app is a piece of sh it won't sync my old wunderlists shared lists don't work i'll be uninstalling and going with a different app thanks microsoft for taking a fantastic app wunderlist and ruining it
__label__1 want upgraded version even to set the duration pathetic app
__label__3 of all the things that this app does great it tries too much and looks clumsy af so much to do just to be able to create a habit and be able to track it
__label__5 by far the best habit building and tracking app i have used and i have tried many have been using the paid version for 6 months or more and my routines ane habits are the best of my life you need more than an app but having a tool like this is key love the flexibility simplicity and the streak oriented design thank you habitbull
__label__4 é um aplicativo pra quem é visual se você ê mais chegado a listas não recomendo o uso mas é um aplicativo muito bom para ver seu tempo livre e o tempo que você gasta com tarefas relacionadas a eventos
__label__1 paid for pro version money taken app is exactly the same as before payment scammed
__label__1 not all tasks reach completion some need to be deleted and rightly so but by design delete action is tucked away under three dots menu and then behind confirmation message thus making deleting tasks in bulk deliberately harder probably to keep fake karma number high and jack up usage statistics the swipe action on the list should be customisable so delete action can be set when its swipe left also since recent updates the upgrade to premium nudge is slapped everywhere
__label__5 just awesome every thing you need in a daily routine good interface but i wish the i had the programmer option in free bravo the developer team who made this
__label__3 generally good and useful with a clean interface but there's a phenomenally annoying bug where tasks often ping all the way to the bottom of your list when you're trying to drag and drop them
__label__1 my desktop task and mobile app task doesn't sync even tho i am using same account google and i am on the premium please fix this issue as i may have to return to todoist if this issue persist longer
__label__1 it hangs then it killed 2 trees without setting alarm
__label__1 amazingly useful app with horrible glitches every week when all checked tasks become undone and overdue and default calendar changed by itself
__label__4 this app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned liferpg app and from a bit of digging so far i'm impressed some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so i'll probably bite on that once i've set up everything and used the app a bit one suggestion i'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events like bringing up a reminder when i'm near the gym or store
__label__3 app is good have lot of features but i would suggest one basic thing that needs to be changed in tasks app the menu can be reached by pressing the title icon also to change the list we have to press the icon on top left corner of widget it is different and little disturbing from normal process we are following since many years please try to change the menu button on widget to the top left icon thanks
__label__3 i'm find this app useful but i'm trying to use it on my desktop is there a way to check off items on my laptop in this app i will change my score once answered thanks
__label__2 the app is good to use overall except as a number of other folks have said it does not sync and there is no response from the developer on this issue annoying to have paid for an app that claimed the sync feature when it doesn't actually work what that means is you lose all history every time you change the phone
__label__2 i can't even enter the shop i want to get more trees but the app just keeps loading
__label__2 loved ticktick great interface and the widget was perfect unfortunately i had to move on to todoist ticktick doesn't have alexa capabilities and that's a deal breaker for a while ifttt and gmail provided a good workaround but recent changes to gmail rendered that functionality inoperable ticktick get on board with alexa and i'll come back
__label__2 im still getting accustomed i like the simplicity
__label__4 i was supppeerrrr exited about the app and it was really good but one of my alarms i set wouldn't turn off unless i deleted the app
__label__2 very hard to use cannot get a list of task to do until do date
__label__1 worst app i qm trying to create acount with gmail but it say no internet connection even my internet work fine every thing working nicely even you tube without lagging
__label__5 wonderful
__label__2 the free version is pretty minimal
__label__3 i was noticed that my phone memory is low and when i was checking which apps i can move to external memory sd card i found that i can't install move your app to the phone's sd card and use it from it but only on and from phone's internal memory as i see that is not an issue by many other apps with similar features and requirements so i suggest you to make this possible
__label__1 hello team i bought the complete package in feb 2015 however when i am trying to use habitbull premium extra it says no account found in database can you please help me with this your support team is also not responding to the the ticket which i have raised earlier support ticket opened 388906
__label__5 good set of features works well only wish i could display tasks or reminders on the calendar without a time duration
__label__1 still cannot share a single task with someone on ticktick you can only share a whole list this is ridiculous especially since the developers have promised it since 2013 i need this feature
__label__5 love the app i would rate it 6 5 if calendar exist
__label__3 laggy
__label__4 синхронизация не работает
__label__5 when microsoft announced they were killing wunderlist my expectations for the new thing were soooo low but they did a great job it has all the familiar featues plus some new ones like subtasks and the user experience is pretty solid importing was easy great job the one negative is microsoft's strongheaded wrong assumption that everyone wants one microsoft account for everything please preserve the ability to create different accounts for different purposes
__label__3 i can't seem to create an anniversary or a birthday event like i used to please assist
__label__4 i like this app as it helps to track things that are important for me i'm still exploring how effective the method is but i like what i found so far it'd be nice to have a way to see the correlations or tendencies among habits if any good job nice idea
__label__5 perfect a calendar with the opportunity to create notes for everyday or other notes on the side i just love it
__label__2 trying to switch from wunderlist and the import option doesn't work or give any assistance to troubleshoot i just get the message file not found with nothing else to say where it's looking for the file so i can get it in the right place
__label__2 i like this app this is a wonderful app i can focus on my studies because of this app
__label__2 reminder feature is not working
__label__4 good job
__label__1 has something wrong it takes the routine i created for one day and do it for all days
__label__5 nice application for daily rut in good job editors
__label__5 love this app
__label__2 it seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all i spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and i could mark it done i try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing the icons are also not intuitive at all
__label__3 hello developers can you please help i put a passcode on the app and now it won't let me access the calender it keeps telling me that my passcode is incorrect when i know i put it in correctly please fix this
__label__4 very helpful and useful i made use of the widget very often but it stopped working and only started back to work when i uninstalled and then reinstalled the app otherwise this is is a 5 star app
__label__3 i'd be fine with paying 10 or 20 for this app i'm not fine with paying 3 a month forever to continue using it without being able to use reminders on the free version it's no more useful than a 5 pocket calendar and i'm not willing to pay what they're asking
__label__3 have to go premium to have more features
__label__1 i paid for the subscription and now it doesnt show up under manage subscriptions for me to be able to end my subscription
__label__4 adding function of goal list eg the work has a goal and the goal shall finish in which days
__label__3 works great easy to use but i wish i had a daily organizer
__label__5 makes studying easy
__label__5 as always ms makes the best thing but fails to offer video training and integration and some basic crm features needs imporvement on 1 multi importance priority level with drop down box and for sorting 2 repeat doesn't add today's to dos just an alert 3 beable to organize more than just today add wk mo yr 4 crm and calendar need upgrading and integration with outlook app 5 training
__label__2 certain of the event doesn't show up in the clock just recorded in my calender
__label__3 i purchased the paid version and i'm sort of disappointed every time i enter a task it adds the first letter of the first word over again so i have to change it each time i e it will autocorrect to eevery instead of every it is also kind of laggy it could be a great app but not as is
__label__5 was inspired by the novel solo leveling and it works
__label__2 gud
__label__3 the circle widget should be bigger
__label__2 honestly the premium version is just not worth it what's the point of having advanced calendar views and event setup and calendar import if in every case you can't see future recurring events the next event in the list of recurring appears only if you have ticked off the previous instance in order to use a calendar efficiently for planning you ought to see what events are next this hindrance has been made present by the users as far as 2015 as i'm seeing online and nothing has been done that not only shows poor hindsight what's a calendar without planning but also a strikingly deaf customer service the app is probably just as good as its free version the pomodoro timer is ok but the extra features are just not worth the expense for the premium version
__label__5 great app kept me organised and disciplined thank you
__label__3 no updates long time ago
__label__2 good
__label__3 nicely
__label__1 great app but why do you need 13 ad trackers in this paid for pro app exodus privacy list 13 trackers against your app which is rediculous using this every day but now concerned my every move is being tracked 13 times edit you inform so that makes it okay then for you perhaps other more privacy focussed users should look elsewhere how do i confirm the trackers are not used trust you i bet 13 are for revenue 1 will suffice for personalising
__label__3 has many nice features but they lack polish 1 has notifications like ticktick but unlike ticktick you'll have to unlock the phone for you to see it 2 has a grocery list where you can add things but you cannot add quantity and many others
__label__1 scam i and my friends subcribed this apps to try collaboration but in faq there it is but actually we didnt find anything with collaboration thing why is it please fix this serious problem
__label__1 as a long time user of wunderlist this new replacement fails at the single most important thing next to holding taks remind the user of said tasks if a task comes up as due i expect it to stay in notifications until i clear the task instead to do decided there's a time limit on how long a reminder stays on your notifications which means it isn't reminding you anymore which forces you to remember to open the app to see your tasks this completely defeats the purpose of a reminder
__label__1 i removed this paid app i missed about a dozen events over the few months i owned this i would look at the app a few minutes after an event was supposed to pop up and it showed that it had missed i'm trying out simple calendar which testing seems to work better
__label__4 it works me like bought the pro ver
__label__5 i never leave reviews but this app truly deserves it somewhat basic in design which is very nice to use and extremely helpful love the traffic light feature most important come first and the sub tasks if you're forgetful or have a lot of little to dos this app would be so beneficial
__label__2 i like the concept because i've been trying to gamify my free time for a while assigning a predifined score to each habit practiced the most during every hour and all i wanted was the positive and the negative habits to affect the same progress bar with the possibility to keep track of a daily score with a possibly negative value it's a damn shame but this aint for me i wish it was more customisable
__label__3 a great way to track goals but quite limited in functionaliry and the google fit integration doesn't work
__label__3 more hierarchy on task options
__label__4 i would have reported this as a bug within the app but i found another bug when trying to do that first one when submitting a bug or feedback it does not pass through the 'to' address into the email so i'm not sure where to send it to second one when editing a habit daily or to do text field the keyboard pops up and disappears a workaround on this for my device is to rotate the phone landscape using pixel 3 otherwise a very good app
__label__3 it allows me to leave the app i have a techno phone how do i fix this sleeptown works perfectly though
__label__1 i was enjoying this app and decided to buy the premium features but they took the money and provided nothing at all i tries contacting the developer via email and no answer at all stay away
__label__4 i really like the idea and it does help me with staying focused but reminder notifications don't always pop up it's also a bit slow at times when loading a new screen and some screens look a bit dated but it's fine anyways i love the feature of being able to plant real trees i'm looking forward to plant one
__label__2 don't like the new changes
__label__5 a great app to keep you up and moving especially being in quarantine this review was made at the time of covid 19
__label__2 such a cool app with deal breaking bug this calendar app could be perfect for me but notifications simply refuse to work
__label__5 very efficient app a real time saver and since the last update a new widget extremely well made and customizable you don't even need to actually open the app
__label__5 have you heard of that saying where did the time go well this app helps me stay on schedule with my day instead of it just disappearing with nothing accomplished love the interface and very user friendly
__label__5 such a motivation for rpg lover like me
__label__2 i used todoist premium for about 6 years but i must say that it has gone down over the years there are so many features missing compared to other similar apps which are either free or charge much less for their premium version the new major update feels like a complete let down with absolutely no new features other than now being able to see subtasks in the parent task dialog box still no kanban view no native calendar view limited to no sorting options just to name a few i'm sorry but dabbing a bit of color on icons or adding a color name next to a color do not qualify as new features i left todoist for ticktick a couple of months ago and have not looked back
__label__3 great but doesn't work offline
__label__3 no funcionan bien las notificaciones y tengo la version de pago
__label__3 nice app but it keeps crashing on my samsung galaxy s6 also reminders don't pop up well when phone is locked or offer good snooze options going to have to uninstall if crashing not fixed
__label__3 i really liked the look of this app and was very nearly a todoist convert because of the planning features but the lack of integration with google assistant and other things in my workflow was a deal breaker will check it out again when integrations are better
__label__5 very useful as it reminds time discipline
__label__1 reply to developer whatsapp continues to run in background and show notifications even after being closed why are you unable to do that original comment i paid 4 for the reminders however reminders work only when the application is active if you exit shut down the application no reminders for you developer should design the application in such a way that it continues to run in background even when user exits it i would like to have my money back unless this problem is rectified
__label__2 i used to depend on this app to basically run my life until i installed the latest as of mar 19 update now it doesn't sync properly with my smartwatch ticking tasks off on my watch no longer marks them complete on my phone also the widget is broken now and doesn't reflect changes i've made unless i restart my phone i sent a support request to the help team but have gotten total radio silence if they don't fix it i'm cancelling my subscription right now it's not worth paying for
__label__3 this is by far the best to do list app i've come by it has rich features and a great interface even in the free version it knows the difference between a task and a habit my main issue here with the app is premium pricing why exactly do i have to pay a monthly fee for features that can be used offline normally a monthly subscription is to support features that need to be consistently paid for from what i can see there's only one if a one time payment option is added i'll buy it
__label__5 sooow good
__label__2 i was given this premium app now with new versions is not updating i fail to understand this if i'm given premium version then now why wouldn't it get updated if it was non upgradable then why was it given it's a great app and so it hurts when there are such tricks used on customers
__label__2 night mode doesnt show up under theme
__label__3 it's okay but the tasks are too simple not a good way to integrate and organize them
__label__3 i love the concept of the app i'm just not digging the functionality trying to set a custom date and time is a complete pain in the you know what every time i select pm it's stays at am i have to do it multiple times before it catches same issue with the clock i try to rotate the dial to select an hour and it hangs and throws me over to minutes i go back to hours and it does the same thing i finally just gave up back to the old string around the finger
__label__2 love and use the app but sync feature does not work and my attempts at eliciting support from customer service have gone unanswered which is disappointing
__label__4 basic version works as described just not what i need the habits i want to improve require reminders at different times of day and i'm personally not finding it an effective incentive especially 'starting over' if missing one time that's kind of a carrot and stick approach i'll stick to a simple checklist of what calendar alarm clock to remind me when making this app's functions kind of basic and redundant and since all apps use space well uninstalled but the app works fine
__label__4 it s great
__label__3 unable to give color to events only blue color is coming
__label__2 i really wanted to like this app but it's just too buggy sometimes i open the app and it doesn't have the icons to switch views also the 12 hour formatting is really flawed and the priority scale seems way too complex high medium low should be enough for most people
__label__5 i'm only two weeks in and purchased premium and killing it even more than usual at work i love this program i mostly use it on my desktop but it's great for when i think of things after hours am on the road with my boss or walking out he office door and someone throws something my way i need to remember
__label__5 i love that this app combines all of my various calendars work and personal to have a quick total view of my day s such a timesaver
__label__5 fast is good sometimes
__label__2 used to love this app but after the update it's dumb and no longer useful
__label__5 best planner ever bought the pro edition it's easy to use and has many convenient functions like tracking overdue tasks
__label__2 absolutely no mention of paying to use this app until you've downloaded it and signed up too bad it looked pretty
__label__1 i purchased the pro version in my motorola g5 plus than uninstalled it now i can't even get that purchase back i understand it happening between two different devices but i'm still using same device please help with it
__label__5 make it possible to attach images and links
__label__1 i keep getting a message saying the app can't connect to the server and every time i tap on a different colour of skin or shirt it stays the same
__label__5 love it
__label__1 rollback right after editing pls fix this
__label__1 not very user friendly uninstalled immediately
__label__3 the app is really useful one must download it but it just have one problem that we need to refresh the widget all the time to see current time unless we don't refresh the widget we cannot check the upcoming event through widget if you can solve this this is one of the best app for daily use and surely you'll get more pro version users of this app thank you
__label__2 i like that it allows specific habits i don't like that it does not give proper percentages of how much you've done your habits after using it about a month i deleted it because even though i was doing almost every habit 100 it kept giving me 50 it was demoralizing
"__label__2 it sounded good so i installed it my first task is an annual subscription 
reminder this app doesn't offer an annual reminder so yet again i'd have 
to use two different apps for tasks why can't anyone get this right"
__label__1 no trial to try premium features what's the point trying app without able to set reminders
__label__4 all the activities planned or unplanned for today should appear under my day
__label__5 it's good
__label__4 every other month i think i'll do better i try again i download this app everything gets back in order so i uninstall it to free up space in my storage then i relapse i download the app again this is a never ending cycle of desperation loss and hope i will always download this app i will always uninstall it 9 10 would recommend
__label__3 can't complete events must keep dismissing it or delete it
__label__5 i spent a long time looking at and trying different calendar apps and this was the only one i could find that had the functionality that i wanted i haven't looked back since i highly recommend it
__label__2 this app is just impossible to use without the whitelist functionality which got removed from the free version great shame
__label__3 please make weekly view free for every device
__label__3 it doesn't work offline and when i'm actually online i need also a vpn to use it
__label__2 trying to set a reoccuring event changes the date to one day before what i set it as trying to change the date back just creates a second event then trying to delete both events takes several tries because half the time they don't actually delete this is really annoying
__label__5 i've been using this as a replacement for the default calendar for years i love it very full featured
__label__4 it's a really good app if you're trying to focus on somethingband it's definitely helping me with my studies for final the satisfaction after you see that the timers up is awesome and works great if you use the reward system for focusing
__label__4 some pieces are a bit less than intuitive some scheduling features are better on the desktop app and a buy forever option would be really cool otherwise no complaints
"__label__2 not what i was looking for i saw there was a time it would remind me i 
thought it would work but non of them did so that sucked"
__label__4 great but latest update has bugs despite having enough coins when i try to purchase the new weeping willow i keep getting an error saying i don't have enough coins
__label__4 i like the simplicity of this app it deserves 5 stars if other features is free
__label__5 ultimate
__label__5 simple to use feels like i'm doing something by planting a tree and setting my phone down i've gotten my 5 year old to sit still and watch the plant grow for over 20 minutes we like saving enough coins to plant real trees the new limited edition trees are exciting to watch for and try to earn but it's nice that you can buy them later too pretty art fun app and plants real trees i love this app
__label__2 adding a picture to a task is a paid feature so free version is not great
__label__5 this app is wonderful but i am having problems with the things linking to the network i have a good internet and have tried restarting the app several times however i can't seem to connect to the shop for my in game currency and the real forest things it says unable to connect i'm just saying this in case i'll check with support
__label__5 works well
__label__5 best to do app
__label__2 i really like this app and helped a lot on mobile usage but after unlocking 3 or 4 tree species the app wont open the same happened after installing the second time
__label__3 task repeat options are garbage for basic things it's ok but don't expect more than that
__label__2 in timeline section i cannot see the upcominh events i can only see the events for today and next day and that kills the purpose of the time table apps people need to see the upcoming event in order to schedule nrw events so they wont overlap with each other keep up the good work and this will be a good app
__label__2 amount debited for renewal with out any notice no option in the app for cancelation of auto renewal dont even recollect there was a option for auto renewal and i have given consent please look into
__label__2 the motivation pics stopped at some level and dont want to be changed pls solve this issue
__label__4 really great i have trouble staying focused on my studies but this had me studying uninterrupted for hours on end i live all the great designs but i just wish there was more options for the start up pack for the trees and the ambiance music but overall brilliant
__label__3 had to create microsoft account to use which annoyed me however can use gmail account and can import from wunderlist which is a plus also signed in on a different device that i have office suite on next time i signed into outlook with work credentials to do signed me out now can't sign into app on my phone so weird
__label__5 so helpful been struggling to concentrate during the pandemic but this has actually managed to make me focus on assignments definitely considering an upgrade to premium
__label__2 after i bought a new tree or switch from the regular one none of my trees die when i switch apps this is disappointing
__label__3 cute but seems like it would benefit from a way to set eg monthly or annual reminders for bills and birthdays without going to a google script
__label__2 you asked me to pay premium version but instant google calendar sync still doesn't work needs few hours for tasks to sync this been an issue for years already and you ignore pleas from users on the other hand the gtasks app you have works really great
__label__2 unable to create an account despite using email or social media account can't even start trying out the app
__label__2 difficult onboarding no integration with google calendars documentation is not very clear
__label__5 this app is simply the best for organising yourself it's so customisable i really love how you can not only set exact times and dates you can then get those reminders to repeat however you want do you want to be reminded every second wednesday of the month no problem do you want reminders only during weekdays sure also my love for this app has grown considerably since i found out you can set location based reminders and you don't even have to pay for it fantastic app a
__label__2 useless and time consuming got pro version but no option for refund
__label__4 a good app in general i would love to be able to have loose tasks for example practice spanish twice a week which should be completed at least twice every week also why not allow icons to be any emoji
__label__5 this is by far the most useful and customisable gamify your life app it also focuses on skills and character building which is my favorite part and mostly missing with comparable apps takes a bit to get into it but it's definitely worth it d
__label__1 there is no time table this app is fake
__label__4 great habit tracking app and you get plenty without premium i like the premium widgets quite a bit and the extra habits would be better if it had the option to flag a habit as skipped rather than fail without breaking the chain for when you can't do it e g in bed early when you have to stay back late at work
__label__4 great app for succeeding with your good habits the widgets are especially useful since you are constantly reminded if you haven't completed one of your habits i also like the discussion page but i miss some sort of timestamp to show when the post comment was posted sometimes you reply on a post that has been dead for quite a while without knowing it
__label__1 can't even log in seems to stop working or freeze up every time just downloaded the app for the first time can't make a new account or log in waste of time will be looking for other apps that actually let me get past the log in screen
__label__2 it's ok the free version does the same thing your calender does on your phone
__label__4 i like it a lot but it doesn't have as much of the game aspect to it i wish there was a feature where you character could actually play in an rpg game using the equipment and skills you earned you could have a little rpg game on the side and has cute little morality stories without it it doesn't really incentivize much
__label__4 very nice setup thought enough of it to pay for premium couple things add ability to change watch hand colors arms match scheduled event making it impossible to see add ability to increase watch face inner diameter digital time difficult to read watch ticwatch pro 4g phone moto z3 w pie
__label__3 i'm giving it only 3 stars because there's no support for caldav tasks sync
__label__3 its alright does same as google maps
__label__1 extremely unintuitive
__label__3 not as useful as wunderlist yet would prefer to have a tab for the week not just day that way i can anticipate also wish items would show up in my calendar
__label__3 some time it's not working not reminding me
__label__5 its perfect i really recommend downloading it it has the priority of your works calendar etc thank you so much it is so useful
__label__2 keeps telling me my email is invalid when it's a normal gmail won't let me sign up
__label__4 just installed love that syncs with google wish the mobile app allowed screen rotation wish i could zoom on the week a month view i understand mobile i in beta looking forward to the evolution
"__label__3 cannot add tags to anything the remainder setting is a little clumsy 
please make it simple by changing it to daily weekdays or weekends except 
for that everything else is cool"
__label__3 i enrolled myself in beta version and gained almost 1000 coins but after sometime the app stopped working properly the start button won't work or the estimated time was almost 3 times the i left the beta version and reinstalled the application it's working fine now but i lost all the coin count and now i am back to square one i was so upset i love this application though but please fix these bugs guys
__label__1 crippled version without even a way to purchase outright edit i'll be clearer many apps features are disabled but there is no way to just buy the app the only option is some ongoing payment subscription which makes no sense as this app does not provide any ongoing or backend service it's just an app and a simple one at that it's like going to buy a water bottle and going to check out they take your credit card info and charge you the same price every year that you use the bottle bottom line it's just a scummy business practice
__label__4 haven't found how to sync between two devices yet
__label__5 it's different from wunderlist but pretty close its like changing from gmail to outlook but it's working for me
__label__3 i love bc1 and btasks but am disappointed that bc2 will not bring my tasks from bt and the new integrated bt syncs only to google tasks but no longer my toodle do account deal breaker for me why would you break the functionality with your own btasks app
__label__5 i am really appreciating these reminders and the ability to track my progress it has a lot of customizable options and it is easy to use highly recommend
__label__4 i especially like the fact that business calendar 2 works with akruto sync to synchronize my calendar and contacts between pc and android phone without putting anything on the cloud occasionally business calendar 2 and akruto sync will duplicate many calendar events making work for me to delete the duplicates
__label__4 i preferred wunderlist but in general this is working too please allow the user to set a default time for reminder suggestions currently it suggests for example 3am in the morning not very useful
__label__3 friend was permabanned for calling another friend a mad c t in party chat but here in australia that's a compliment tl dr over sensitive language filter should allow party chat to be unfiltered
__label__1 forest store is not working
__label__5 best app i've tried for this purpose and i stopped trying others until further notice i'm considering paying for the fancy things since the app is so smooth and it's cheap enough
__label__2 i'm a breath away from uninstalling this app again half the time it doesn't even do what it's supposed to do some things it doesn't even let you do inside the app you have to go to the actual browser version to do it on that subject the mobile browser is beyond awkward no chance of navigating it properly if i'm supposed to log into an actual pc just to check off that i did a workout or washed dishes forget it right now the only reward i get is having my good mood ruined certainly not worth it
__label__3 เป นapp ท ทำให ม สมาธ ในการอ านหน งส อมากข นแต แอพเด งบ อย อยากให ปร บปร งและพ ฒนาต อนะคะ
__label__4 love the app best of it's kind imo not perfect but so close this app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks if i may suggest having the 00 digits be optional and not by default when setting entering goals having multiple reminder notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day ex 200 push ups a day with 4 reminders so i can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits or the ability to group habits
__label__1 used this calendar for years without any issue now ads will take over the entire screen after entering an appointment in the calendar and there is a delay before you can cancel them out terrible and disappointing choice on the part of the developers they've lost me as a user as i refuse to pay for a pro version for a simple calendar app do yourself a favor and stay away the ads suck and are annoying
__label__4 a good app if you know exactly what you want you'll need this app to get started but a lot of us don't know what we want to do we don't have a lifestyle coach to tell us how to improve our habits or how to be productive we seek it out in the charming articles on the internet so maybe populate the internet with this app's usability behind a healthy productive living theme idk just saying
__label__2 please add a feature that make me add a friend to the habit such as habit competition app i can't live without this feature
__label__1 vorrei avere indietro i miei soldi visto che il login non funziona e che non sembra esistere un'assistenza tecnica i want my money back since i cannot login
__label__1 the app hasn't synced for nearly 9 months despite being a premium user the support team haven't acknowledged my email it's a good concept but they've failed to make it work and don't provide customer support check other reviews go to play google store on a web browser select my account and go to order history select the and it offers you an option to request a refund that should get the developer to either repair it or take off the premium services it is falsely selling
__label__5 just what i've been searching for i like the compact view of the routines and tasks and the satisfying way to mark them completed or not the sorting options are useful it would be great if you could add automatic syncing to gdrive at some point
__label__3 great idea it needs some improvements imo edit after playing for a while i noticed some things that definitely need improvement faster loading times when changing sections or when receiving items you shouldn't have to refresh to see them that also applies when feeding pets where i dont see a progress in the bar unless i refresh etc
__label__3 i like this app but recently it keep crashes i have already update to the latest version and it still keeps doing that i can't even open the app please help thank you
__label__5 awesome experience motivational helped in studies and health fitness also in stress management
__label__5 good aplication
__label__4 it's very good moved off wunderlist since microsoft is forcing a ms account and will eventually get rid of it it's not as good as wunderlist which i miss but it's very good so using this moving forward
__label__5 best app for habits track and tasks i ever used highly recommend easy to use
__label__3 i used to really love this app and i still do for its flexibility and functionality i was considering getting the pro version but because i am a small business owner it was not yet necessary since the recent change to the new add format i am watching full screen adds and waiting for them to finish oftentimes no skip option the adds are so obnoxious that the first time it appeared i tought i was hacked it's hampering my productivity and now it has also put me off getting the pro version
__label__3 the best app around for tracking habits but the artificial limitation to 5 habits in the free version coupled with the eye gouging price of the pro version lost it two stars i paid but i am not happy with the price
__label__4 it would be much better if there was an option letting you categorize some apps as exceptions for example i'm studying and then i need to use my dictionary but i can't cause if i want to do it i have to give up which is a bit annoying
__label__5 awesome
__label__2 the interface is very nice and simple however once i got down to using it and setting some tasks five tasks total about an hour later i went back to the app to make edits but instead saw the list of tasks that i have set were deleted if the app has an issue saving the tasks it needs to be fixed i will change the rating once that bug is resolved
__label__1 do not install this app i used to love it but in the most recent update the advertisements have made it absolutely unusable i am switching to google calendar and never looking back
__label__4 thus far i'm finding to do useful it feels a step up from wunderlist time will tell for sure
__label__3 i need the facility to create a new list by duplicating an existing one as available in wunderlist i am unable to find it in this app
__label__2 wish they kept the wunderlist app instead it was perfect some issues i had with this app compared to wunderlist to fix have new items added to the top instead of adding to the bottom or have option to change more quick choice options for the reminder times quick add bar to just type in a search bar box instead of clicking the button have settings apply to all lists so don't have to individually change each list option to add to list on main screen without clicking in list
__label__3 pls and pls kindly refund me i was charged yesterday i didnt realize that i was still subscribed to the app because i deleted it i cant afford it right now cuz i dont have a job and i still need to pay my tution fees pls refund me crying pls refund my money
__label__4 i do like the straight forwardness of this system it does what it says on the tin needs to keep developing but in the theme it's in if it gets to clever like some systems it will loss it's position
__label__2 this is very good app but the monthly cost or yearly cost are not worth it for me i found a free app that does tbe same things
__label__3 want to put a line through items but leave them visible don't know how to manipulate to keep certain items from week to week but cancel others no instructions but better than other apps that i've seen
__label__3 good design but it's not exactly free if you have to pay for basic features like reoccurring events
__label__5 very useful
__label__3 you cant set reminders without paying what is the point of an electronic to do list if you cant be reminded to do your tasts
__label__3 everytime i wanted to swap between month day it lags so much if only it was smooth then i am very excited with the app i am using lenovo a7 3000
__label__2 this was a great list app then something happened and i stopped getting notifications i checked the app and it said i needed to allow permissions due to android 6 0 i've been on android 7 0 since i started using the app but regardless i checked and permissions were set and allowed the app to provide notifications still didnt work i've tried resetting the phone resetting permissions nothing works now i'll try uninstalling it and using something else
__label__3 it does not play ring tone on my mobile
__label__3 great app but needs to be able to switch accounts easily i have an account for personal life and work life on my phone it is very difficult to switch back and forth and keep my other apps happy that are connected to todoist
__label__5 excellent super app gift my god thankyou
__label__4 so far i am enjoying this task app i am still learning new things but is definitely helping me stay organized
__label__3 ok but i hate big full screen ads with long videos
__label__3 i wish reminders weren't just a premium feature they should be a basic feature everything else is fine
__label__4 rarely read never do i write reviews but this app has been transformative for my life and productivity in general the only issue i sometimes have is the custom song i apply to notifications doesnt always play
__label__3 not usable since the pop up cannot be disabled without completely disabling notifications they do not intend to fix this for anyone who isn't on android q pity the rest of the app beats most other to do apps
__label__1 after updating ads took over the screen disappointed i'll look into other calendar apps as alternative
__label__3 5 habits for free version is not enough instead of limiting habits for free version disable notifications or cloud storage or inter device sync theme calendar support and these similar abilities for free version
__label__4 haven't found how to sync between two devices yet
__label__1 garbage makes no sense
__label__3 all awesome except widgets they randomly and annoyingly often stop working phone either needs to be restarted or widgets re added or both
__label__5 how to see my completed tasks i am confused as i accidentally clicked on done and tasks stopped appearing on the list obviously but it creates problem cuz you didn't do but it checked so please add feature so we can see all our completed tasks upto a month so we can see our records and edit any possible mistakes thank you other than this small part this app is best for me i am requesting you if you can listen us please please add this feature completed tasks list upto a month
__label__5 great little app lovely interface and does what i need it do by reminding me what tasks habits i want to do each day i like the feature where i can see my overall success percentage for each habit
__label__2 well based on the description of this app and what i understood i would receive has not lived up to its description i hope the bugs will be worked out i emailed for help more than 24 hours ago and have not received any response thus far it would be helpful to have a help and or faq section to refer to after only one day of using the app i have encountered the following 1 from calendar screen button does not give option for project only event task or note i have the upgraded version 2 settings general start with is set for day view but shows month instead 3 help feedback only gives option to email for help no option to search for help 4 when deleting an item in a series comma i do not get the option to just delete the one occurrence am i doing something wrong is there any help that i can expect to receive i paid 4 99 for the upgraded version and i am not at all happy busy people with crazy schedules need a reliable app
__label__3 used to like this app a lot but recently the time input got changed from a normal clock to a spinner where you have to manually scroll through the numbers to find the time you want makes setting reminders very tedious
__label__2 everything is good but the tree does'nt die if i press the home button nd now my sub concious mind knows this which makes this app kimda useless for me
__label__5 great for organizing
__label__3 i love the app but its shame that i can't add my tasks on my calendar after i planned my day i am heavy calendar user i use it to schedule every hour of my day but i can't do anything similar with this app except to remind me at certsin time to me having to see how your day is structured by the hours is really usefull uninstalling it for this reason
__label__2 i loved this app but after the new update i am unable to use the widget uninstalled
__label__5 absolutely love it
__label__1 keeps notify me only sound without any notifications or any tasks and every time i open the app i got a pop up window with an old task that i finished already before along time ago what is matter it was a good app
__label__4 new item menu for actions is horrible please bring the old one back delete action has a bad offset and is rendered behind the navigation bar it's so inconvenient
__label__4 a beautiful app but i would love an option where you dont have to set a time you just put it on and watch the trees grow as you work and come back to your phone an hour or two hours whenever youre done i also found that trees die if i dont come back fast enough after my timer expires like if i set my timer for 1 hour and i come back in 2 ill find the tree died thats weird is that a bug on my end beautiful app guys i love it but those things above would have me using it more
__label__4 this has been really engaging in my tasks and goals and i am just at day two of using it for the app it would be cool if there was a notification for any chat threads users are on so if anybody had a follow up question i would be able to return to the inquiry and add more to the discussion if needed
__label__1 hate itt
__label__3 random ad pop ups that distracts while pulling up a meeting in a hurry doesn't parse contacts from email meeting invites into names you can easily add and remove is pro worth 6 a little too high imo but developer is entitled to sell at whatever price i find google calendar works fine for my needs
__label__1 theres always something shifty to me about an app that shouldnt need a subscription for doing the absolute minimum they make setting reminders too complicated and they're hoping you forget to end your free trial before they start doing automatic payments that's just how most of these apps work you're better off setting an alarm on your phones clock and having that on repeat than you are using this
__label__5
__label__2 tasks that repeat more than once daily dont work if you have something that is twice a day you have to have two separate tasks if you leave a task pending until the following day and complete it it will never work again
__label__5 i really love this app so far it would be nice though if a habit task would disappear from the widget list when completed for the day it would make a better sense of accomplishment
__label__5 i've been a paper planner girl for years i need the pretty colors and stickers while i still have a paper planner that hasn't been touched for months i needed something on my phone because with 3 kids spaced 6 years apart we are busy we homeschool year round as well as appointments and family stuff artful agenda fits everything i need update on the fly and it's pretty i keep a tab open on my desktop as well as the app on my phone
__label__3 love it but it isn't an add in on outlook it's forcing me to use wunderlist because i like the feature of it syncing with my outlook calendar
__label__3 right now i m using todoist for simple tasks as an inbox for research and non essential stuff but todoist needs to step up their game i don't use todoist for long term planning i use my other task manager for that or for important tasks or projects because todoist simply is not built for actual projects although it refers to its lists as projects what todoist and many users actually are wanting from todoist is a task outliner close to mylifeorganized notion dynalist where projects exist within the task outline had to give it a three star meh rating
__label__4 cool app can almost replace the other widgets i have on my home screen but missing one feature which is not the fault of the app but a shortcoming for my particular needs weather include weather and i can easily pay for this app still keeping as it is a good app
__label__2 not a bad app but dont pay for the premium the widgets dont work
__label__1 i tried 3 or 4 times to download this app import my wunderlist data and share lists with my husband each time it failed miserably not trying again finding a better app
__label__4 so far i like the app question i see a spot where it says notes for the month but how do i input notes i don't see the option to enter notes
__label__2 everytime i snooze an event it disappears this calendar is useless maybe i did not explain properly it does not dissapear as in not in my calendar as an event when i have set a reminder alarm at i get a notification pop up i snooze it for 30min i do not get another reminder in 30 min
__label__4 i like that the app in simple i turned off the motivational quotes so all i see is the calendar and that's all i need to see one thing i would add though is the ability to add exception so missed days don't count against my streak one of my goals is a daily activity that i can only do at home when i travel i miss those days but i did it every day i was able i e every day i was home so it's a bit of a downer to be penalized
__label__3 very good app but i wish it can be used offline
__label__1 cool concept but sync doesn't work and the desktop add on is half baked i wish the developer would be responsive to my emails as well
__label__5 love love love this its the best of both worlds paper and digital and syncs with all your calendars awesome app
__label__5 very useful lots of options while staying simple to use i use it all the time
__label__3 would be better if it was possible to add to the top of the list it is not easy to use with one hand since everything is in the top left corner lists do not automatically sort and sort needs to be done again if anything is changed
__label__1 read a negative review which had a reply to someone calling out the subscription they said all major features are available for free no no they aren't you can't access the calendar at all it's an entire tab on the bottom of the app it's pretty major in my book
__label__4 keeps me on top of work jobs home jobs and family would be 5 if i could pin the list to my home screen which i have tried to find a way of doing but cant seem to
__label__2 would be great but almost everything you need to customize it when you first install it is pro only you can't customize font settings it's pro you can't import old calendars it's pro how am i supposed to start using your app then
__label__2 please make a home screen where it shows your active main tasks allowing you to just press and view them without having to click the top left button snd select this would be very convenient thank you
__label__4 it's okay i just really hope it would let you do more for free i know it's 95 free but i like to repeat some tasks for a week i am not saying it is bad it's an excellent app
__label__3 the app is helpful and has nice features i would give 5 stars but you apparently you are not able to transfer your lists to another device unless you have exactly the same version i had to create all my lists from scratch
__label__4 very good
__label__4 i'm using 2 calenders and 1 to do planner not including this all has their pros and functions i want yet they're different in style this is one of the best i just love using the week view seeing at one shot time of events laid out in planner including notes on that day with pics uploaded if needed it sync with my anydo planner which has a calender but i just love how i can use this a bit differently for scheduling best if only it has a daily mood tracker added in the notes function
__label__2 i have been using the fully unlocked version of this application for over a year this is a fantastic app however it lacks the capability to sync with outlook calendars for example if i have subscribed to my work outlook calendar in google calendar the events will not be synchronized with sectograph this would be fine if this was the documented behavior of this application however subscribed outlook calendars are selectable from the calendar selection menu
__label__5 this app is great love how it harnesses events task and notes all in one simple interface i would love to see a google chrome version wouldn't suggest changing much it would just be more convenient to plan everything out using a desktop or laptop rather than using a phone or tablet also the widget functions need some improvement if possible it would be nice to see a daily widget with events tasks and notes for the day overall really like the app
__label__4 i like the app have been using it for a few months now and the widgets plus reminders definitely keep me on track only drawback i've found is the inability to sync my profile always fails with 'sync failed make sure you have a working internet connection' have sent in support request but so far no response that aside the app works well and i can still use it in 'standalone' mode on my primary android phone
__label__3 it is good sometime app does not work properly intimation not shown on time
__label__3 the app itself is pretty good my issue came from having difficulties canceling my subscription i described everything i was doing to try to do it what i was seeing instead of the option to unsubscribe etc the solution suggested did not help so i described the situation further the next response came from a different person who suggested a method i had already mentioned was not working for me after i replied again i never got another response i just figured out what the issue was but i couldn't do so before getting charged again disappointed in the customer service
__label__4 it's relatively helpful especially when checking habit progress however some notifications do not come on time but nevertheless i recommend it
__label__2 do i have to add tasks daily or can i copy whole list for daily
__label__5 the app is just what i wanted but i'd be so glad if there's a feature to move all the routine events in time equally like if you wake 30 mins late you can move all of the events 30 mins upwards
__label__3 i really like this application very well done my reason for 3 and not 5stars is the lack of any security no option for fingerprint or pin before viewing what could be sensitive personal information please add security
"__label__3 it's well put together but the timer functionality doesn't really belong 
the controls are unintuitive and they have an arbitrary 5min minimum which 
ruined the use case i was going to use it for"
__label__4 this app is good and it's useful yes it's true that it has a few bugs here and there but the app itself is good and i like it i wish it had an offline mode because i can't stay on all the time but i can see why we need to be online at all times
__label__3 just getting used to it but so far not bad
__label__5 love love love this app i have been a paper planner lover for 30 years and i just switched to artful agenda and i couldn't be more pleased try it you'll love it
__label__2 not sure
__label__1 the idea is great however it adds only event to my calendar i like circle planer idea and that i simply can put work and then event at work and that it reflects on this circle this has potential but make it simple and functional i was used to test some apps and for me this was not functional and easy going make it that 7 years old kid can use it
__label__4 some functionality is not seamless there is no feature to order the tasks in a custom order or group tasks within a list
__label__2 the single franklincovey planner feature available is the task abc123 priorities system but oddly the task status system is missing no more fc system functionality as of the rest it's a very conventional pim suite with a little of crm salt pepper
__label__5 well like anything this app is only as useful as you're willing to let it be but if you are committed to either making or breaking or both any habit you can think of then this little jewel of an app can help you do that the idea of streaks may seem trivial to some but we all crave this at some level because it clearly marks out your accomplishments in a tangible way when you see you have x days of success you are that much more likely to overcome the impediments you may face what's more this program is highly flexible in the ways you can track any given habit i have yet to find a habit and pattern i couldn't set up the app is free although i paid for the premium version because 1 i hate ads and 2 i liked the flexibility of data export so just try it and you may find that it changes your life for the better
__label__1 manage subscription is not given in the app menu
__label__3 so so i expected the ability to attach files to notes and a lot more flexibility with format
__label__3 any way to resize font so short events can still have a complete or at least longer than 2 words display
__label__3 something is wrong with the syncing i can enter events but they don't sync the google calendar will sync
__label__3 i think the app should request permission over other apps or if possible have it as a widget it keeps getting inactive when removed from recent files tab of the phone
__label__1 don't install this app this is forgery i've used this app for more than 2 years when i changed my mobile phone i couldn't login when i logged in it says this email account is not in our database i have the mail to prove that i had had the account in the app i mailed the company 4 5 times but there's no reply 2 years of my habit data is lost
__label__2 i wanted to use this app the concept is really good but i won't use it simply because it barely functions for starters it's online only but as if that wasn't enough the sync on android is just all over the place the app would sometimes ask have you done these things today for tasks that were scheduled the day before or at 1 am for tasks on that day speaking of tasks i couldn't set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week per task wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them for some reason they would all sync to same weekdays i enabled reminders but never had a reminder come up once and as far as i researched online this is a common problem on android and hasn't been resolved for some time so it seems i have to create a habit of opening this habit tracker app
__label__3 it's a great way to make a to do list but it never gives reminders when i want it to
__label__5 my skin is clear my crops are watered and i am truly living my best life i don't think i could recommend this app enough
__label__3 unable to download
__label__5 easy to use and cross platform synching makes this app one of the best for managing to do activities
__label__3 i was using journal but can't write much until my hand gets better so i was looking for the app to plan my day preciously by time thought time line of this app would work like all the icon and pre made taps but disappointed that i can not use those icons by itself for my event unless you creat another routine if dev's can modify the app that makes all those taps can be added to timeline by itself with my own time not only as events or routine that would be perfect thanks
__label__2 confusing and what they don't tell you before you download is that you have to pay for mostly all the features
__label__3
__label__3 i need to track not only good habits but also bad with this app it is impossible i don't want to smoke at least two times in a month or greater to reach my goal i want to smoke no more then two times in a month or less for success
__label__4 the app works great as a digital day planner the only complaint that i have i dont see a way to edit tasks after i enter them
__label__3 awesome app does what it's supposed to aside from reminding you i always forget what i'm supposed to do because it wont remind me at the right times
__label__2 despite logging out of all my google accounts and restaring my phone i still can't restore my premium account
__label__1 dislike the latest widget downgrade the loss of the ability to select multiple tasks is frustrating not sure how long i will stick with this app now as the widget is far less user friendly than previous version
__label__5 great app i wish that google reminders would be also possible on it but it is great nevertheless
__label__3 good idea and work i would like to give it 5 stars if you solve my problem im using asus zenfone 3 max and app not able to detect my usage of other apps and plant never withers even if i close the app i give every permission it demands but it still continues im pro version user by the way
__label__1 app broken don't bother like many many other reviewers this app is totally broken and defunct on android devices and specifically galaxy s10 note 10 devices it seems the developer response to all of those reviews is please report a bug but this has now been an issue for months that they haven't looked into fixing despite dozens of notifications from users that their app is broken i have instead now downloaded an app by another developer which actually works i will not be back
__label__5 simple and useful and so far bug free just what i wanted
__label__3 appears to work the same as wunderlist and imports your lists but if several people share a list you can't share it anymore
__label__2 it is complicated
__label__5 love this app i'm much more organized with it
"__label__3 i'm trying to stop sleeping in so late you have various sleeping 
requirements but no get up before x category gonna have to find a new 
app i guess lame"
__label__2 useless you need a premium account to use widgets
__label__1 alexa shopping list integration is rubbish items are added correctly but if an item is removed by another user they never leave the list
__label__2 i was expecting it to sync google reminders also from google calender i use them a lot it has so much to do but since it cannot sync reminders like how it does for events it's not what i am looking for
__label__2 used to really love this app and it really helped me start working until i found out that none of my trees die when i switch apps tried all the instructions in the faqs section of their website but nothing worked great idea but super disappointed it doesn't work in my phone
__label__3 overall great organization tool however recent updates make the application only usable in horizontal view which is extremely annoying and quite an inconvenience
__label__5 beautiful graph calendar i love how beautiful and practical this is i love it
__label__4 it's a great app i use it when i'm trying to study and it helped me a lot but whenever i want to search something from google i can't please don't get me wrong giving 4 stars
__label__1 1 star bc i was forced to change apps yet there are no meaningful improvements from wunderlist but boy are there downgrades harder to share lists with my husband syncing is spotty didn't improve the calendar view to let you see your schedule the my day only allows you to manually add one task at a time by opening each task and moving it i have to manually add it if it's due today this is a huge flop killed wunderlist and now i have to pay for a different app that actually works
__label__4 nice app it helps a lot to save time you will understand where you used more time and where you should spend more time
__label__1 wont let me change my appearance so i'm stuck as a black female the user interface is very poorly designed
__label__2 good app but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful there's no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store even if you cancel the app will think you're still subscribed so basically when you pick a subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help when using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10 of the time and the devs basically said oh well we can't fix that when i mentioned it
__label__2 no subscription tank you please full price i no lack forever
__label__3 5 habits for free version is not enough instead of limiting habits for free version disable notifications or cloud storage or inter device sync theme calendar support and these similar abilities for free version
__label__2 useful but constantly calls out to access crashlytics facebook etc too much spyware i'm searching to replace it app also locks you in so you cannot export to another app
__label__4 great calendar app easy to use
__label__5 the 1 best habit tracking app in my opinion you can record the amount of activities you do and see the final result at the end of week when recording your activities it shows your average amount of the activities done during the week this app also keeps my life back on track and reminds me what i need to do throughout the day and its very convenient this app is extremely easy to use and it is free i honestly wouldnt be able to live without it thank you
__label__3 this is a great app for a group but what it lacks is a comment for every tasks or even a separated note section
__label__2 please get rid of all the white space i have to scroll to read my lists give us an option to zoom out or reskin this app to look like wunderlist thanks
__label__3 one of the best app for focussing and productivity the coin system motivates me to go for more sessions but the app freezes everytime after udimg it for few days please solve this as soon as possible
__label__1 the wigit doesn't come with the free version it does the same thing your google calendar can do i was looking for something for time blocking this is time flopping
__label__3 honestly i would give it 5 star since i'm not going to subscribe or anything but the fact that you need to subscribe just to change the theme just to change it into dark theme is deal breaker so 3 star it is i know you guys also need to make money but for a appearance options need to be paid is a no for me i get it if it's like new option like color coding so you can easily sort stuff things like that
__label__5 it's just as good as wunderlist and so much more
"__label__3 i just downloaded to try and noticed that thr color selection do no good 
since you are not able to change the font color to be able to read clearly 
over the chosen color only option is white no good"
__label__2 coming over from wunderlist started the import and its been importing for 2 days only half my lists have transferred seems hung
__label__3 my wedget doesn't update weather help
__label__4 i like this app alot it lets me track my habits and goals in an intuitive way only would ask a few minor things like a line on the bar chart that shows the limit goal task alarms even when app not active
__label__4 good organizer this apps is lovely to look at and good for scheduling it is more for idealized schedule as it does not really let you adjust during the day if something comes up overall good
__label__5 hands down the best if you have a laundry list of to do items on your list this app is absolutely the best that i have found that keeps all of them nice and compact in one very user friendly interface
__label__4 great app but for some time i am not able to create an event from the widget i have even paid for the app hoping it will resolve itself but this feature still isn't working properly
__label__2 good idea implementation to be revised the management of the task is not clear the dates are showed in a confusing way again the concept is good but the user interface has to be improved and updated
__label__2 when i first installed it it was working perfectly fine but the next day after that i can't even open the app anymore
__label__3 great but over half the time when i edit a task it changes the year to the 1960s even though it says 2019 when selected
__label__4 i tried out several to do apps to replace my sun setting wunderlist and liked this one the best the only feature i'm missing at this point and it is a big one thus the 4 instead of 5 stars is a list of all tasks to dos one master list of everything from all other lists is a crucial feature and very much needed for now i am marking all tasks as important so they are all captured there as a workaround p s i am loving the tags feature and the audio when you check a task off so fulfilling
__label__2 please add the option of automatically adding tasks to the top instead of forcing them to the bottom that's the only thing stopping me from switching over from wunderlist edit i just heard you're killing off wunderlist for good in may of 2020 i know i'm just one person but i'll be jumping ship if such a simple improvement isn't made edit again 3 27 and you did an update but why in the world would you give ios the add tasks to the top feature but not android come on please
__label__2 update used to be great now they've added so many steps it's no longer the simple app it used to be very disappointed
__label__2 beneficial to get my goal it's heplful to make discipline and commitments to yourself it's continually popping up notification that what you have decided according to your time table over all its good and helpful for students
__label__3 it's a cool way of getting at a glance your schedule the theme could be more colorful
__label__4 need at least few more levels of subtasks and lists for it to be perfect otherwise everything is good love it
__label__3 great app but the update has ruined the functionality of the widget i can no longer figure out how to select multiple tasks and it is no longer possible to go straight to the app from the widget these are to important features for quickly making more complex changes to your schedule the widget could be improved otherwise the app is great
__label__5 i love it this app us so simple and easy to use it's so clear to see what needs to be done i love how you can carry tasks over from one day to another or carry over tasks from over lists i also love how you can add steps to a task and set a due date i love it
__label__3 i don't get reminded everyday like i wish shalom
__label__2 i love the idea of this app unfortunately it is not super user friendly i've been using it for over a month and it is not very obvious how to complete quests or anything else and yes i have gone through the faqs i finally figured out how to hatch eggs but that's all it's a pretty clunky app as a game but it does a pretty good job of keeping me accountable for things that's the only reason i haven't deleted it as a gamify your life app i'm not convinced hopefully it improves
__label__3 this app is a great idea and i love all the features however no matter what i set the day start time to for daily tasks to reset they keep resetting at some seemingly random point in the middle of the day despite me having it at 2am which is causing all of my evening tasks and some of my midday tasks to fail as i haven't done them yet i'm not sure if the app thinks i'm in a different time zone or what but it's very irritating if they fix that it's 5 stars for sure
__label__4 it's a great app is great for reminders the only thing is that it doesn't always refresh automatically meaning that if you're too busy to do it manually every so often you're going to miss your reminders
__label__3 mostly really good great for sharing tasks between people phones desktops but the widgets on android keep clearing themselves and have to be re added to work again and repeating tasks constantly change the day they alert you on reminding me the day after or before i set them to i keep having to edit them back again really frustrating what's the point in a daily reminder if it keeps changing to try and alert you the day before it existed edit and again anytime there's a clock change
__label__4 like the app but instead of monthly payment it should have been a one time app purchase
__label__4 please solve the problem with fast typing after i type in the date letters and numbers remain
__label__4 nice clean app good functionality
__label__3 good but still does not handle repeat events such as daylight savings time change i e setting a reminder for the second sunday of march each year to change clocks that don't adjust automatically does not handle last day of the month reminders well also the list should display an icon by repeating tasks backup options are very limited does not handle integration with e g dropbox otherwise it would be perfect for my needs
__label__3 i cannot re edit the date like i used to in the last update please fix it i want to edit it from the text box not from the calender
__label__1 terrible can't control whether things repeat it not and a study task is automatically a habit stupidly paid for the premium upfront agree with others that idk where 4 6 came from
__label__4 a great app i just downloaded it and i already love it the only issue here is slight ui bugs november 2017 gets covered up by the tabs at the top and on the day section the date runs into the calender layout again great app but those errors make the app look less professional i would recommend rescaling the fragments so they fit better on the page as well as the toolbar definitely am recommending to friends though
__label__5 working good so far
__label__3 guys please assist me on notification no notification on my one plus 6 ive paid premium problem still persist even there's no battery saver nor notification blocker turned on please advise thanks
__label__2 as a user of gtasks owned by ticktick how do i fully synchronise my data with the cloud preferably google but will make do with the ticktick servers i pay for this service but only 40 of my tasks are backed up on ticktick server cloud any and all advice much appreciated kind regards john collington
__label__2 useless no nesting
__label__3 tasks helps me stay organized but i still want some option to be in it like if i want to copy a task from a list to another i should duplicate it in the the same list and then move it to the other list i wish if i can directly duplicate it but not in the same list instead in another list directly but in general tasks is a very helpful app for organizing our life
__label__3 i bought the pro version in hope i can organize my time to do my tasks but the progrmer just disables the routine that's all really the other thing i didn't like was to set a routine for a reoccurring like school or sleep i had to set it for every single day one by one you could have add a reapet feature to it i'm not happy i wish i could get my money back
__label__5 the xp system and character sheet are a good way to motivate you to finish tasks although yes you can cheat and give infinite xp but you're only cheating yourself
__label__1 was loving this app originally did everything i wanted calendar reminders lists habits easy to use until latest android upgrade no longer receiving any reminders disappointed tried everything and the app just doesn't work will unfortunately be cancelling my subscription
__label__2 lacks option to automatically skip all missed recurrences on recurring tasks manual skipping of missed recurrences is not a powerful enough solution
__label__3 i like the way this app is so intuitive to use but it has just been updated and there are dots that can be selected generally on websites these are used for options you select one then do something with it but in todoist when an option is selected it deletes that task it is very confusing and counter productive swiping the task was much more intuitive i don't know why this has been changed when it worked fine as it was as the saying goes if it ain't broke don't fix it
__label__3 ok app
__label__3 it's not bad but it seems greedy like why do i have to pay to unlock individual color themes if i'm paying a monthly subscription also liferpg was so much better than this more icons to choose from and they were free if you're going to make an app that copies all the ideas from liferpg at least make it better why can't i make an accomplishment like learned blank piece of music without having to tie it to accomplishing a certain number of tasks or reaching a certain level
__label__5 so i love this app i think it's perfect for what i needed at the time sadly my job changed and so did my need for a calendar planner artful agenda was still great but i found myself no longer using the stickers or really having time to add information to it i canceled my subscription they were super easy to work with i still recommend this app to girls when asked i love and miss artful agenda when my job changes again i'll be back
__label__5 rarely taking the time to write a review but on this one it's absolutely worth it was looking for a calendar app that has some powerfull widgets to bring anything you need straight to the homescreen and it just nails it straight forward no nonsense user experience propper column calendar with tasks in one widget slick highly customisable design syncs instantly it's been a straight up game changer for me so far and went premium thanks a lot developing and maintaining this app
__label__1 was working fine until recently where all of my reminders are triggering a day early
__label__3 it's really unresponsive i have to tap 3 times so something opens or to check a box or anything too bad i really liked it but this is too annoying
__label__2 the new widget redesign omits one important feature before the widget has todoist icon and i could use it to launch the app from the widget right away it is no more there so i have to go to the app drawer to lunch the app every time i need it makes widget less useful not happy
__label__3 nice app however one important feature missing in app is you can not assign the task to some other person this feature is there in desktop version and very useful in corporate environment
__label__3 this is a great app and it really helped me do my tasks but it doesn't work properly for example when i try to move a habit so that the list is in the order i want it to be the app glitches and the habit is sent back to the top i know those problems are almost insignificant but it gets seriously annoying sometimes fix those little problems and i'll give this app the five stars it deserves
__label__1 not good worst app
__label__4 just started but i am interested
__label__5 agenda always in sync so you ll never forget a thing sync your phone s calendar google calendar facebook events outlook calendar or any other calendar so you don t forget an important event set reminders one time reminders recurring reminders location reminders voice reminders new easily create tasks and get reminders in whatsapp work toge
__label__5 i love it this app us so simple and easy to use it's so clear to see what needs to be done i love how you can carry tasks over from one day to another or carry over tasks from over lists i also love how you can add steps to a task and set a due date i love it
__label__5 suka banget lengkap banget fiturnya
__label__5 this app is very easy to use it's simple but effective i have a to do list function on my phone won't say what kind of phone but it's very hard to understand so i write everything down on paper and then lose it
__label__1 wunderlist was better shared my list with my husband and it won't sync or show up when one of us changes something it shows us both on the list but when he deleted an item it didn't show as deleted on mine after refreshing five times
__label__1 doesn't update changes live or correctly even was a waste of money for some basic app
__label__4 awesome to scheduled my job and personal issues
__label__3 уууу
__label__1 forced to migrate from wunderlist i am very disappointed that basic features are missing here new items to the top of the list so they don't get lost in long lists and starred items to the top of the list easy way to prioritize and rearrange without these features for me the app is unusable currently looking for a suitable replacement
__label__1 no
__label__1 notifications don't work it's a shame because i wanted to buy a subscription edit okay i already know what's going on the operating system of my smartphone is miui this app's notifications work when the battery saver mode is turned off at the same time in the application settings i have the option no restrictions battery saver doesn't restrict app's activity other applications similar to this one todo habits work with this option and at the same time enable battery saving
__label__1 would love to actually get started with this app but for whatever reason i can't even build my avatar none of the options for selecting what i want my avatar to look like actually show up on the screen they're all completely invisible
__label__3 ok but feels like untested alpha state software tricky to navigate quickly when called from a widget direct call entry for phone calls seems to be missing though that's the first thing one needs in a todo list sorting tasks is either impossible or a well hidden feature sharing and assigning is very rudimentary
__label__5 a good tool to manage and remind me of my tasks
__label__5 pretty good and pleasing to the eyes but it would be nice if there is a button to see tomorrow schedule like a quick overview
__label__1 uninstalled still cannot remove background to blank edit yep still the same also please put the free backgrounds at the top this is from only within the app by the way
__label__3 i lost all my pictures that i had attached in wunderlist
__label__3 great app i wish i had more chance to add reminders without buying premium
__label__5 i normally don't review apps but this one is amazing this digital planner was exactly what i wanted give it a try you won't regret it
__label__5 been very happy with this app i love the widget and calendar view that show the names of the events in calendar view very helpful
__label__3 i like the concept of the app and the fun gamification of reaching your goals however it is super buggy on android the app is constantly quitting unexpectedly not closing tasks properly and not doing rewards properly i've reported it multiple times now and there has never been any update to fix it i recommend going with another app if you have an android device to save yourself the frustration
__label__2 very buggy and doesn't always show whole pages or lists
__label__1 unable to download it beyond 78 even as other apps download in a second
__label__5 helps keep me on track with setting establishing new goals
__label__4 it will helo you to stay focused
__label__3 i don't like to put on google calendar every schedule
__label__5 best to do app i try very intuitive interface my day now is completely organized karma feature is very interesting and motivating thank you for this amazing app
__label__5 this is a really good app feature rich free version notifications work perfectly several widgets to choose from lists and ability to share lists with other people what else can i wish for
__label__3 very nice app but there are a few bugs with the widget not really updating to the correct data e g if you put the widget on home screen change the name of the tasks list it doesn't update
__label__2 the app does not sync with my google calendar and there is no sync option or refresh option meetings etc are not shown and i have to go back to the google calendar or acalender to make sure i don't miss anything events made on my tablet do not show on my phone please fix this it's such a great app if it just worked
__label__5 very good ui i really like the way it lets me manage views and multi task with my email i paid for the pro version
__label__2 i quite like habitica but this app has some issues the biggest problem for me is that switching the to do list to scheduled is supposed to sort the to do items by due date that's how it works on the website but it doesn't that makes the to do list in the app useless for me
__label__1 been using this app for years this app called itself business calendar but now includes popups which blasts the speaker at full volume how am i supposed to use this app during business meetings like the others who gave their feedbacks guess it's time we move on to another calendar app like onecalendar which dosent have ads
__label__5 uso a versão gratuita o app tem funcionado muito bem para acompanhar meus diferentes hábitos que estou tentando desenvolver
__label__4 we had some syncing issues with our shared lists that came in from wunderlist but once we had them syncing things have worked great
__label__1 not at all good experience with this app not easy to use at all
__label__4 great idea functional easier to read vs traditional calendars reminders still learning it but i think that i am going to really like how useful it is thank you
__label__1 in appropriate app
__label__2 wish i could sync it across multiple devices
__label__5 it was so easy to use
__label__2 study bunny is better and this app blocks you from the premium features let alone the thought of buying more dull features in this dull app meh
__label__3 recurring tasks an essential feature is available only in premium premium is not available for one time purchase monthly payment is way too much for an indian it got to be affordable with one time payment for everyone to use may be some one time payment option for different features like recurrent tasks location reminder and paid themes would have been made it accessible for many
__label__2 i loved this app at first but now when i change my task dates times it doesn't actually change them and continues to alert me at the original time even though i've clearly changed it it's very annoying
__label__3 i'm constantly finding little glitches in the game that throw off what i am trying to do when i am trying to earn points thank goodness for husband and siblings who have played this enough to know how to fix things when they go buggy but i don't appreciate not being able to go to customer service or send a quick email to help them update the system and fix it
__label__3 i gave it a lower rating because lately if i had any repeat scheduled appointments i can't change one without changing them all very aggravating before i was able to cancel one without affecting all the future repeat weekly or monthly entries before i could use this calendar to keep track of my past activities now it looks like i attended a meeting when i didn't because i couldn't cancel it without affecting future meetings
__label__2 i'm changing the rating into two stars because the sync feature which previously work fine has no longer work looking at the last update i feel like the developer had abandoned this apps which is quite sad considering this usef to be the best apps on building habit
__label__1 there should be add different time schedule in app not be in mobile colander
__label__4 it's better then the other apps i've tried but there should a bottom where it says you couldn't do the task instead of just turning the task as an overdue
__label__1 oohh im very hardly managing it and its a disgusting app just a waste of time also it is not uninstalling
__label__2 i put an event in and it doubles everyday fix the glitches this is a great app otherwise
__label__3 implement collaborative lists please so crucial
__label__2 checked out this app in my quest to find a good solution for combining calendar events and tasks into a single scrollable homescreen widget unfortunately although the app has the option to repeat a task from the completion date the functionality is broken for example i scheduled my test task on a tuesday and set it to repeat every week from the completion date the app forced there to be a day of the week listed in the repeat schedule so that it would say something like repeat weekly on thursday on completion date now having a day of the week and also from completion date makes no sense so i was curious what the app would do i set my tuesday task to repeat every thursday from completion date and checked it off on a sunday the app should have rescheduled the task for the following sunday but it didn't it scheduled it for the following tuesday and completely ignored the thursday and the from completion date sorry business calendar 2 but that's just not going to work
__label__3 you cannot check off when you have finished a task in your routine also a tad confusing tags are cute
__label__5 i just downloaded this app and i can tell that it's very useful and user freindly i used other apps to organize myself but this one takes the cake and on top of that the developers owner of this app responds to issues or suggested features unlike other apps i've used that's the main reason i think this app is great
__label__5 so useful i struggle with adhd on a daily basis i can never remember to do simple tasks and things like notebooks whiteboards stickynotes alarms they just don't work but this app helps change the game dude it's a clever way to incentivize completing tasks and it's helping me build better habits with the reminders and penalties for not completing it if you miss it super useful i feel more productive and motivated to get my tasks done i'm grateful this app exists
__label__3 pretty good could be better
__label__3 just migrated to tick tick it's better with more holistic useful functionality and cheaper with free version having not that much restrictions like in todoist sorry guys it seems you have some work to do if you want to stay competitive
__label__2 worked fine for months now it doesn't track habits the way i set them it treats every day as its own success or failure regardless of how i have set it up going to have to uninstall and find a new habit tracking app
__label__1 happening for the second time in a row it's an amazing app but when i need the most my premium account was deactivated even with the automatic renew i paid for that and it's not working so upset
__label__3 era pra poder criar conta e salvar o progresso mesmo sem pagar
__label__3 widget is not informative it shows a text of a task but not date and time that is not comfortable user has to open task to see when it is scheduled google tasks widget is much better in this case
__label__4 i'm easily motivated by things like points and streaks so this app works really well for me to increase my productivity and decrease my anxiety i use rewards for breaks and find that i get unpleasant but short tasks done much more often because i can earn breaks quickly by just getting them over with i also get my long complicated multi part projects done early i gave it four stars because there are a couple of features i'd like to see but it works great as is
__label__2 zero features in free version
__label__5 just started using this app as i am starting to forget things so this app helps remind me and it helps me to just get up and move great for motivation
__label__3 some nice features here their approach really set it apart from the other i've tried so far it's a strong contender as a wunderlist replacement the only reason i am still not confident on a switch is their wear integration it's terrible the app doesn't listen to the watch at all i've tried completing and snoozing and it does nothing the watch app can only add tasks so the screenshots they're sharing here are deceptive i also wish i could hide completed task instead of deleting
__label__5 i am unable to create a new daily this is the main reason why i downloaded habitica the error message says ' ' is not a valid enum value for path 'frequency' edit the app works perfectly now i've been using it for over 6 months without a single issue this is the best self improvement app ever created
__label__2 this app is inferior to wunderlist as of now it needs to be an option to duplicate a list exactly and rename it you should also be able to attach pictures and instructions to long lists that you've made it's just not nearly as intuitive as wunderlist i have 50 locations that often need all the same services performed and it is a major waste of time to type can01 can02 can03 can04 etc every time i have a sweeping maintenance issue
__label__5 the best planner app i've ever used
__label__1 deleting was great now horrible bad move with the ads guys
__label__3 you can have just 5 habits for free we should have more
__label__3 so far its working for me i needed something that could ring or vibrate
__label__1 uselss forced here from wunderlist closing my whole family used that now all our lists are different doesnt sync accross shared lists defeats the purpose altogether also a more contrived interface im now off searching for a better alternative to start all over again as this ain't it
__label__4 great visualization of my day but feel there's a little too much at once maybe more options to toggle parts widget is the best part
__label__2 the new notifications are useless to me i always keep my phone on vibrate and the old normal android notification would vibrate my phone and notify me on my watch too but now the new notification pops up silently and is very easy to miss and i've tried changing the settings and nothing works i really don't understand why not use android's build in notifications instead of this new thing or why is there no option to turn it off
__label__3 i do enjoy this app but it looks and functions terribly on anything but a mobile aspect ratio i'm attempting to use this for chromeos on a pixelbook but the app is unable to run in windowed mode or resize in landscape mode properly i am also a pro user but the app lacks pro functions there is no pause feature to be found on either the android or chrome extension and deleting records costs an additional 60 coins
__label__5 this app does exactly what i need it to do i love that it integrates with google chrome ams synchronizes across all of my devices 5 stars
__label__2 it doesn't ring to notify me
__label__3 you have to subscribe for the pro version i'd rather just have one flat fee
__label__3 the widget keeps distorting itself resize fixes it but not for long edit monthly widget nova launcher nova launcher has worled great for me trough several android versions i'm not going to the stock one your widget was also not working in android 8 nova i upgraded a few days ago
__label__1 this could be an awesome app it has great potential except for a few flaws that end up making it a super irritating app i have reported these issues to the app's tech support several times only to get lame responses with no resolutions the latest being that when items are entered into a category in this app the app for some reason resorts the sequence of items in my list automatically i put these items in the list in a certain order for a reason i have other issues but no moreroomher
__label__3 so great
__label__1 it shows adds which kills my time i mean this app does not serve its purpose
__label__2 it seems like this app is no longer supported i've paid for premium but sync stopped working several months ago and developers have not replied to a support request so on moving to a new phone my habits and streaks are now lost i can see from other reviews that this is a widely reported issue i guess the app has now been abandoned
__label__1 lag all the time
__label__3 it's good designed to be productive but not reliable in practice especially the attachments many times they are not on the server and you don't know which ones are there and which ones have failed to upload
__label__3 i got a newer phone and i used the same email that i purchased the pro app on but it won't let me install it again for free when i've already paid for it
__label__3 had to leave the beta when i saw the nice large bold text input when you hit the button go away i love the current nice large text design on the input hopefully it doesn't go away or at least remains an option turning off auto updates for a while on this app just in case you decide to make this poor life decision final
__label__4 i used to be able to tap on the widget and it opened but now it doesn't what's the point of the widget if it doesn't open was able to quickly fix in the settings thanks for the comment
__label__3 don't have any options to manage daily expenses
__label__1 one of the worst in the genre
__label__3 i paid for this app now they have forced ads on me i would like a refund
__label__2 multiclick spam to encourage upgrading to pro version
__label__3 it was working great for about 2 weeks but now shuts down ant time i try and invite atty attendee to any event so disappointed i thoight this was going to be my go to app and be reliable the search continues
__label__4 you responded to but still don't understand my comment about repeating event scheduling i know that you can schedule repeating events i know how to do that but each repeating event is scheduled at intervals reliant on the original event date what if i sometimes would like the event to repeat from the actual completion date for example i forget to renew my library books for a week when i renew them finally l have 3 weeks before i need to review them again but your system says 2
__label__1 not impressed considering the size of the owner loses entire days worth of data if refreshed as prompted to apply update shows lists differently on mobile app can't order some lists painfully slow to sync between devices when compared to any checklist app available annoyed since i switched from wunderlist when microsoft started ruining it
__label__5 loving it would appreciate dark mode as well
__label__5 best app ever addictive to complete task and see progression
__label__1 this app is not worth the 6 a year poorly developed with several glitches
__label__5 syncs across android and ios devices can manage tasks and arrange them according to priority and has a file management system for different tasks needed
__label__3 hi wonderful ticktick developers i'm not able to buy the premium product errros are unavailable for this purchase or cac 01 i've cleared data on goodle play services ticktick etc upi payment credit card debit card vodafone billing netbanking none works can you please help
__label__2 a glorified stock calendar as tech support calls it the native calendar app forget it if you have an outlook calendar notwithstanding what appears on the app only exchange is supported seems they spent more time on bells and whistles than the underlying architecture of the app
__label__2 loved it untill recently when it started playing adds eveytime i put in an appointment now ill have to get a new calender app after years of using it and loving it too bad
__label__3 ui too complicated not very user friendly
__label__5 love this app devs always fix issues quickly too
__label__3 it's not a bad app but i find it too cumbersome to navigate i would have liked a simpler display of tasks visually and organizationally it needs work
__label__4 find this a great app full diary views to do lists and appointments can be on home screen i have it on both my tablet and phone only problem i find is that sometimes it stop syncing
__label__3 i set an event and told it to remind me an hour before it didn't remind me and i ended up missing my doctors appointment not good
__label__5 excellent
__label__3 there are bugs that break the immersion for me it's not as responsive as it looks and the design should be worked out in the app to complete a challenge i need to post my goal on the chat fine but then i cannot access the chat room through the app and i need to use the browser for that please improve the user xp
__label__3 great app
__label__4 i like the simple interface and it helps me set reminders for tasks schedule them and analyse them
__label__3 it is ok
__label__5 best productivity app very intuitive to use and a must have for power users
__label__4 its nice to when u r responsible for ur mistake off the track ur tree breaks gives guilt of wasting time on phone
__label__4 good app but it needs more work i gave it four stars because its missing a premium selection that is an overview of your activities so one can see total time spent on what this could be in a form of a pie bar or line chart you can include all so we have a choice with this anyone can now keep track of time spent on a daily activity and limit time spent on said activity so far good work work guys
__label__3 i like this app it's simple and gets the job done only downside is you're allowed to track up to only seven habits without the premium version
__label__4 so far i love it
__label__3 great to do list the only issue is location based reminders seem to be sporadic also annoying that you can't set all day tasks hopefully an update soon no resolution and tech support slow a shame
__label__3 they need money for whitelist and great feature which is not good although its great app
__label__1 whenever creating a new event it doesn't use the calendar's default reminders which google calendar does so i have to use google calendar to add new events this kind of defeats the purpose of having this app installed also constant popups nagging to buy premium i'd buy premium to improve my experience not to make it more bearable
__label__1 when i set to remind me daily it shows even in past and it doesn't remind me kindly let me know the way to set it proper
__label__2 when you switch the language you get wierd bug that your app is half in english half in selected language
__label__5 great app if you need to keep a list of tasks or develop good habits or stop bad habits this is for you premium vip is only 4 99
__label__3 great potential but i can't use the app to its full extent due to its counter intuitive layout just filling two days in routine view turned it into an endless scroll shame the app really looked like what i was looking for reply thanks for taking my review into account yes i think a horisontal orientation would be much better maybe leave both options that way everyone can decide what best suits them
__label__2 i was told to install planner pro instead of planner plus which was what i already used in order for my cell phone ipad to sync i have had at least 5 emails back forth with the contact person but i still can't get my calendars linked using my email address as instructed i guess i will have to go back to my google calendar i love the planner plus but need a calendar that syncs to both my cell and ipad
__label__1 please make it possible to quickly switch from the widget to the app one star to attract attention will make it 5 as soon as widgettoappbutton appears
__label__3 this app needs a combined list of all accounts to make it usable
__label__4 great app and the only flaw i see is that you can't yet export your data please make it so you can export data to something like pdf or something so i can save my entries forever
__label__5 perfect
__label__4 cool app but i wish i could see everything i own at once when i get a new item i have to search every inventory screen to figure out where is went confusing for new players also if you don't have a party it's basically a checklist since all the gane modes are forced multiplayer
__label__4 i think it's by far one of the best apps out there it integrates well with the default calendar app and really helps you to track your day tons of customizable buttons and even the clock face itself from the hour minute arms colour and thickness length to the placement of the numbers on the clockface i love how it displays the time remaining to your next meeting task or alarm widget is pretty good and you have full functionality from the comfort of your home screen lock screen display
__label__2 quite good one but i prefer single purchase option but seriously i like the statistics well i saw it automatically logs out and not doing backup
__label__2 please remove the annoying and intrusive ads
__label__4 a little confusing to navigate at first but otherwise useful
__label__3 everything is good but i would like to see more then a five slots for habits
__label__2 too expensive and without paying there's no backup there's free apps that do the same thing
__label__1 useless so confusing to use cant set simple reminders
__label__5 wonderful app that simply shows your progress of creating habits love the visual layout that helps he stay on track
__label__2 works well but free version only gives you three total lists
__label__3 i like the layout and it looks promising but i have at least 20 google subcalendars so i can color code things and keep them separate and it can at best display part of 1 no google tasks show up at all i could be doing something wrong but there are very few options and everytime i go to the app it reverts to the wrong google account on my tab
__label__5 i love how i can write done everything and it helps me stay organized it feels great to tick off completed tasks
__label__3 it 's good
__label__5 great app
__label__5 have had this app for about 2 weeks and i love it my last app crashed terribly and did not recover lost everything this app is super simple to use with the right mix and selection of tools will update my rating in time
__label__1 deleted my account because i found something more aligned to my needs but i still got charged for another year developer ignored my email and then denied a refund via paypal so i've now paid 28 for something i can't and no longer want to use had no issues with the app itself but very disappointed with the customer service
__label__3 app is good but no task sync between devices is a big let down
__label__3 excellent with a single exception i've used todoist for about 5 years and it's the best app in its class the free version outperforms other paid apps in my experience the one thing holding it back for me is the home screen widget on my phone it struggles to load lags is unresponsive won't select tasks properly the list may well go on in short there are so many things which sometimes break it rarely works this is fundamental 5 stars if fixed til then it's a reluctant 3
__label__3 widget i add on home screen doesn't work when i'm offline
__label__2 very bad app i organised all of my activities took me 1 hour to complete my planner then realised that the app automatically sets the time at am so all my afternoon activities where at the morning for example if i had to eat at 1pm it said that i had to eat at 1am so i changed them to pm and suddenly the app errased my whole schedule wasting 1 hour
__label__5 great calendar and planning app easy to use and get the job done well worth the extra money for the pro version i enjoy the extra theme's i recommend this over google calendar
__label__3 would have given more stars if the add folder option was not removed from the original wunderlist to do list i also used to be able to take photos offline and they will be automatically uploaded when i'm online now i must be online to even use my camera i also do not like the idea that when you add a new note or something it stays at the bottom these notes should automatically move to the top like how it did in wunderlist otherwise the app is helpful for most of what i do
__label__3 poor completed tasks stay within the list dotted all around today shows items due tomorrow before thise due today tasks dragged from one list to another stay in original list not very useful i'm looking for an alternative
__label__4 a good starter app 4 collecting the data you need to better your daily life limited flexibility in the free version but sufficient four basic tracking of self improvement efforts easy to get started and so i can do without cute reminder and encouragement features they are easy enough to toggle off
__label__5 the most intuitive app ever over the years i've tried numerous self management techniques and apps but this is the best by far i love that it combines so many personal productivity functions in one including pomo timers kanban boards habit tracker smart reminders etc best by far is the minimalist flexible calendar the devs have done an incredible job update months later and i still love this and use it daily
__label__4 really love the app helps me organize my time and schedule if you could just make the hours numbering in front of the sector and adding an option for showing minute division lines would really help to read it better setting the hours numbering outside the clock makes it look kinda crowded and with some of the hour numbers 12 3 6 9 not shown kinda bothers me also please make a preview of the clock in the settings so we won't need to switch from the app to the homescreen to see the changes really looking forward to see these features fixed overall great app
__label__4 good but have to pay for many of the features
__label__3 this is by far the best and complete todo list app i have come across so far however the notification and alarm feature doesn't work would have gotten a 5 star from me if that had worked thank you
__label__5 amazing app meets requirements and even excels them well done on this app and notifications notes and reminders are all taken care if and safely delivered to you on time
__label__5 bought the premium version and now i actually have healthy routines in my life which is a lot for an adult with adhd
__label__1 lousy app
__label__2 would like to assign priority rating to each task a do it soon b do it later c low priority z take it off the list
__label__4 this app has really helped me get my stuff in order it also has an active community and good challenges it is a bit glitchy at times things don't refresh etc but overall it's great edit lol the 'report a bug' is glitched on my phone p i had to manually send my info over in the middle of fixing a glitch where my day won't reset been broken for a week
__label__2 not very user friendly and very less interactive
__label__4 needs more vibrant colors perfect everywhere else
__label__2 notification is now pathetic shame i liked it a lot i think its time to jump ship it's been fun
__label__3 if all you want is to make lists or be reminded of something once then this is a great app but if you want a reoccurring reminder forget it it won't recreate the reminder for the next occurrence once you complete the first occurrence
__label__4 perfect app but its missing an important tab its already got habits dailies and to do's but it doesn't have a bucket list life goals tab for me it doesn't feel right to put learn a new recipe in the to do tab i also want to put in my goals like focus on getting high grades or get a girlfriend i can't put these in other tabs
__label__2 it is a great app allows you to stay focused and not use your phone but once i update the lastest version of the app and bought the premium pass the app keeps on crashing my phone is android version 9
__label__2 i made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week they seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day i can't edit the original repeating ones i can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times this is very annoying this app was a waste of my money i paid for the ability to make repeating tasks i'm very disappointed
__label__5 it's very helpful in keeping track of tasks and managing time
__label__3 in this free version we can add 5 habits only
__label__3 im sure the pro version is great but it didn't keep my interest long enough
__label__5 this app is truly helping me be productive and the ui is very good reminders sent on whatsapp are a boon in short a great app
"__label__2 repeat function doesnt work so you can't set up tasks to be repeated 
daily you can basically create a list and then delete items as they are 
completed that is all this does basically useless for anything other than 
a shopping list"
__label__4 its a good app i honestly dont mind that you need to have premium to get the themes as long as there are no ads im fine i just wish you could create a widget that you can see on your home screen that would be so convenient
__label__3 its a cool app but im afraid it doesnt all too well on my huawei p9 leica it doesnt kill the plant when i switch apps rendering the whole experience pointless i followed all the setup instructions and forums but it still didnt work
__label__3 i love this app so far but i cannot access the store to buy more trees and plants which is a huge bummer i love all the special little guys that need to be unlocked
__label__1 read a negative review which had a reply to someone calling out the subscription they said all major features are available for free no no they aren't you can't access the calendar at all it's an entire tab on the bottom of the app it's pretty major in my book
__label__3 it's just okay i much preferred wunderlist i'd give a 5 star rating if microsoft to do added new items to the top of the list not the bottom and allow you to move any item to the top by pressing the star on that item similar to wunderlist needless to say i'm gonna be using this app a whole lot less than i had used wunderlist until this is fixed it's a huge inconvenience for me to have to keep dragging each new item to the top of my lists which tend to be very long
__label__1 since the last update always unfortunally has stoped
__label__5 this app is outstanding i love dark mode so i upgraded to premium it's 100 worth it excellent app great to organize motivate yourself thank you
__label__4 looking forward to a better ui ux will keep using it
__label__2 had high hopes for this because it had everything i wanted but the completed tasks that i keep putting as completed come back the next day which is just irritating have tried all the settings to get of it but i can't and can't be bothered to persevere anymore
__label__5 i have this app for 3 years and still think it is a great app i bought the full version after some time but the free version is great too easy initiative visually pleasing and reliable
__label__3 with discipline training apps the market bet is on already diligent people to buy your app with such a small margin of customers you cannot expect success from limiting customization options to microtransactions let alone subscriptions otherwise the app was decent good work credit where credit is due
__label__1 not into your ads i've had your app on my phone for years uoure about to be deleted for a google calendar sorry
"__label__2 the app is fine but the widget never became available on my phone or watch 
the widget was the whole reason i used this app"
__label__2 very average app not intuitive will probably spend more time trying to plan than doing
__label__5 the best extremely easy toggle view hide of your different calendars direct from the month view ability to create new google calendars which you can't do on standard google calendar exceptional customization so the app widget can always match your phones theme etc etc took me about an hour to decide 100 that i will purchase pro if for no other reason than to say thanks but the features and look are amazing
__label__3 i liked it nic one thanks
__label__4 not quite wunderlist but i'm pretty happy overall with how it works one suggestion would be having a tomorrow option similar to my day so you can add stuff to your my day the night before
__label__3 i input my appointments and it does not ring loud enough or pop up to let me know that i have an appt i have the paid version am i doing something wrong if my appt is at 11 00 do i have to input at 12 00 to get it to ring before 11 screwy lewy i will change my comments and rating once i get this resolved
__label__3 i purchased the pro version but i changed my phone so the app says that i have to purchase to log in what should i do
__label__2 the ads on this app are cancerous and the subscription model for this type of app is ludicrous charge a single flat rate if the style does change to flat rate ad free i'll gladly change my review
__label__2 it constantly crashes and misses a lot of functionality hard to use and annoys with some popups that can be discarded only by closing app and then opening it again and permanent noticfaction that can't be disabled payd 30 euro for this and used for month before it got so annoying that i started to look for another app fortunately i found one todoist it's unbelievable how much better that is also there is version of todoist for pc for your smart watch and even as browser extension which allows you to easily set a certain web page as task and all these are synced
__label__3 seems like i really great app but i just installed it and i couldn't get passed the avatar creation screen
__label__3 puris make limit at least 10 for free version
__label__5 good app does exactly what it says it will i like that cause it's hard to find nowadays
__label__3 i've recently started using ticktick so far so good it would be nice if you could alphabetize the items checked off so that they are easier to find when you want to add them back to your list i haven't found a list system that does that yet
__label__2 good app but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful there's no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store even if you cancel the app will think you're still subscribed so basically when you pick a subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help when using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10 of the time and the devs basically said oh well we can't fix that when i mentioned it
__label__3 good
__label__1 as a long time user of wunderlist this new replacement fails at the single most important thing next to holding taks remind the user of said tasks if a task comes up as due i expect it to stay in notifications until i clear the task instead to do decided there's a time limit on how long a reminder stays on your notifications which means it isn't reminding you anymore which forces you to remember to open the app to see your tasks this completely defeats the purpose of a reminder
__label__3 i accepted a 14 day free trial but changed my mind just straight away how do i cancel i go into my subscriptions in google play but i do not find this app among my subscriotions i suppose it will turn up there only when the 14days free trial is over pleas confirm how to cancel thanks
__label__2 edit been using it for a while occasionally and every time it feels like a hassle to find what i need to reach within the app i only use the routines no events or reminders i have a separate app for that google assistant wit a calendar to add a change to one day it requires a lot of clicking to amend it i end up writing down the rest of the day tasks on paper deleting amending the times and adding them manually with the new times that's counterproductive i need an easy way to move
__label__4 works very well and is easy to use
__label__4 it really helps me being productive but maybe you could make it more worth it to continue after the time has ran out like get more money or a medal or something because personally i feel like doing more than you planned should be rewarded
__label__1 crippled version without even a way to purchase outright edit i'll be clearer many apps features are disabled but there is no way to just buy the app the only option is some ongoing payment subscription which makes no sense as this app does not provide any ongoing or backend service it's just an app and a simple one at that it's like going to buy a water bottle and going to check out they take your credit card info and charge you the same price every year that you use the bottle bottom line it's just a scummy business practice
__label__2 at first i really liked it because all the systems are functioning well in my phone but when i used this in the tab the notifications wont even turn i sm really pissed by this and i hope you fix this asap
__label__3 every time i change the language to arabic and the app restore the default language
__label__5 awesome was using wunderlist but they are going away i tried a few others they are all so similar now but this one seems like it will be here for the long haul judging by the number of downloads also it is as simple as wunderlist i did have to pay 29 and waunderlist was free for the most important functions so that was different but after using the app for a week i'm sold not a better app out there for my purposes kiss keep it simple stupid and this app does that
__label__3 great app because i can keep all of my tasks synchronized to my laptop great for a student but on mobile i can't create new tasks with a custom due date because the keyboard doesn't go away in the calender to chose and i can't select any other dates than those in the first week can't even reach the save select button simple fixable error but it infuriates me every time it comes up
__label__3 a decent app but for me it's not worth paying 15 yr for and that's at 50 off 30 is just ridiculous for a to do calender app there are other task calender apps just as good and free
__label__2 good
__label__2 keeps hanging even after you actually pay money for the premium version
__label__3 really don't like that they changed the empty time slots back to the way they were whenever you delete an activity the activity gets replaced with an empty block separate from the empty blocks before or after it i find it to be extremely unnecessary but the new feature of increasing or decreasing an activity in 1 5 or 15 minute chunks is great and the programmer feature works well as always particularly good for planning out studies and work
__label__2 once the app reinstalled itself and i lost everything i still have no idea why it did this also it often doesn't open when i first tap the icon if i tap it multiple times it eventually opens within a particular task i found it frustrating and i've now uninstalled it it would be a great app if some of these bugs could be resolved
__label__3 i downloaded this app on my tablet long time ago full version and recently also downloaded it on my phone as i don't bring my tablet with me all the time i only use the task function because my calendar events do not sync properly i haven't fpnd the sync button on my phone and another not so funny thing for me i am using the same account for both devices but i can't use the full version on my phone i get a message that i need to buy it that's why i need to use my tablet with the full version on it if i want to add something
__label__4 great app for sharing lists having the ios android and windows options makes it easy for everyone to manage and view the shared lists wish it had location based reminder and built in spell check then it would be 5
__label__3 all my tasks are gone and unable to load anything
__label__1 impossible to use
__label__3 good but needs a true black background option with white letters dark grey isn't black
__label__5 great to help organize
__label__3 at times it doesn't even buzz or come up on my phone that i had a task to complete i'm not sure if this is just my phone though
__label__5 gooooooooooooood niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
__label__3 sharing lists doesn't work nearly as well as it did in wunderlist otherwise ok
__label__5 it's very optimised for everyday notifications notes list making and planning in general the widget is quite handy offering a preview of all the day of the week and tasks and events you have written down my recommendation
__label__3 everything requires you to pay money might as well make it a paid game instead of deceiving people for a free app
__label__3 not sure yet about other features but definitely need the ability to access the full app from the widget
__label__4 after update time picker control is bad it's very difficult to pick a time and it takes much more time to pick it please revert it as it was before one for reverted time picker
__label__3 really unique app that motivates me to get stuff done unfortunately this app needs a lot of work i tried writing a message in a guild chat once it got long enough the words disappeared behind my keyboard so i couldn't see what i was writing when i put the keyboard down the send button disappeared as a result i couldn't send my message theres no search for trying to find a challenge that suits you theres no notifications when your party is chatting there is also no search for guilds i just started this app and so for these are the problems i've noticed otherwise it is great and i hope it improves
__label__3 should help you more
__label__2 doesn't show a files attached to the event using google calendar
__label__2 it could be a very useful app but it is not very intuitive why should i set up the date in google calendar and not directly in the app
__label__4 great app only complaint is that i'd like the amoled dark mode in the app to match the widget
__label__3 it is simple to use ok for day to day use
__label__3 reminder doesn't work
__label__4 i just download this app and it was so cool and helpful it helps me to stay focus and use my time wisely
__label__4 a great way to keep myself focused i enjoy the different tree options and seeing the forests i grow every day good way to measure my producticity levels too
__label__3 difficult to use and doesn't show name of activity only when i click on it
__label__5 love hate relationship the app is great it nags and nags and nags per your settings until you want to kill it dead and then again but it does its job the reminders are rude intrusive nagging annoying and constant but acheive your goal of reminding you to take care of things until you actually achieve items on your list i hate it but it's supreme for procrastinators busy people air heads and anyone else who needs a keeper to keep them on target phone setting dependent
__label__1 i wanted to like this app it's a very convenient way to see all the info i need right on the screen but when i click on the task button i get trapped on the task screen with no way back i have to kill the app to restart it in the clock visualization mode
__label__2 heres the thing i love this app and the idea behind it but for some reason its so dang glitchy pages wont always change when i scroll tasks dont refresh i often have to completely close the app help very willing to change this review to 5 stars if we get this figured out
__label__3 why did you show the checkboxes in widget when you can't even check uncheck it via the widget its just so frustrating to go to the app just to check a list other than that this app is good
__label__5 helps plan out the day it's just the best
__label__1 absolutely terrible customer service they refused after several years to fix the 9 7 tablet aspect ratio for a paying customer this is absolutely poor customer service has never work properly once don't buy those that run away
__label__2 since last major update rescheduling a task takes you to the day where it is scheduled preventing you from quickly rescheduling all tasks on a given day productivity killer
__label__5 simple yet effective app to manage daily and weekly schedules a tad difficult to learn and setup but once you get going it feels natural
__label__5 after i found out wunderlist was going away i look for an app that could do all the things that could do as it was pretty much perfect for me todoist is pretty much as good not perfect but for free i can't complain
__label__1 only 5 habit you can update
__label__3 app is overall amazing only thing that i was missing that there is not any feature for prioritising the activities hope the developers will add it soon
__label__2 i m just very lazy enough to use this app plus this app is not based on concept of habit building let's see how habbit is built u do task u get reward but here for sake of reward u only get dots connected in pattern that's not motivating instead u can give some offers as reward
__label__5 love the simplicity and design
__label__5 i love this app it's the best and keeping things healthy with yourself and i love it so much
__label__3 it is difficult to set an event or goal without a tutorial
__label__3 app has been useful in helping me keep track of tasks and all but lately the alarms i set on my dailies haven't been going off at all which is unfortunate because they're all to remind me to eat
__label__4 i wish i could control the reminders for my tasks more like the volume or what noise it makes other that that the app is great for keeping track of things that need to be done
__label__3 this is a great app but i purchased it to be able to use it with my samsung gear s3 little did i know that i can't use it with my watch bc this app was made to be used with android wear which i found out later my bad so will you be working on making this app compatible with samsung gear that would open your market quite a lot with samsung gear users i've been using the wearable app with my watch but it doesn't work smoothly at all please work on that if you can thanks
__label__1 i downloaded the app and it worked fine only once the second time i tried to open the app it stops by itself i tired uninstalling and installing again the same thing happened again this is the 4th time i had installed the app it worked fine once and again has just stopped working it wont even open
__label__5 two things could be improved 1 there should be a option if i want to view the tasks organized into sub projects in a project view concerning the last update 2 the sub tasks could be better organized maybe nested inside the options just like in microsoft's task app
__label__3 i like it but when i put my pass code in to access it i goes through but then it says your password has been changed please sign in but i have to hit the back button on my phone to ignore it so it doesn't make me sign in again but when i do hit ok for it to let me sign in again my password isn't there it's still locked but i don't know the password
__label__2 this app is closing down everytime i try to do anything but daily tasks rather frustrating
__label__3 app is glitching and when i open a calendar event it says no title and won't let me edit also changes the date to today mid editing of an event you're creating even if you already changed the date
__label__5 great app i love this for my daily lists shopping lists etc i love it also has the sub lists with tasks would definately reccomend this app
__label__2 it's an interesting idea but this app missed some extremely important features namely a landscape mode as well as a custom notification sound why those are extremely easy features to add my use case is placing my phone on a stand in landscape mode so i can charge it while at work i want a custom notification sound at work and i want to be able to watch the timer go down without the screen stuck in portrait also i keep the screen on and the app disses me because i have the app open
__label__5 this is the closest app i've found since my last upgrade lost a similar app best thing about it it's very user friendly everythings right at my fingertips i'm still getting used to it but loving it so far i have only one change i'd like to see i love how i can change the arrangement in my lists could you make it so i can change the arrangement of my catagories as well thank you i hope i don't loose this one when it comes time to upgrade
__label__2 i love this app but recently it has been freezing every time i add a new task it's updated and i even reinstalled it yet it is still happening
__label__2 this app is closing down everytime i try to do anything but daily tasks rather frustrating
__label__3 when the system is set to dark theme the home screen widget fails to display the list correctly
__label__5 it's top notch but i removed it just because other outlook related apps not working well in outlook
__label__3 useless edit thanks for replying i wish the tasks could be repeated every day like in a morning routine that is done everyday to give the user a sense of having a productive morning or something
__label__3 now you get a 30sec ad whenever you create a new calendar entry still an excellent calendar
__label__3 wish i could add events without having anything to do with google calendar
__label__4 works well nice interface
__label__5 the 4th image from the beginning has a time difference in the phone time and the edited time can change it apart from that the app is just great and loved it
__label__2 i made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week they seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day i can't edit the original repeating ones i can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times this is very annoying this app was a waste of my money i paid for the ability to make repeating tasks i'm very disappointed
__label__4 this is a great app and i love it bit i have two small issues with it first i don't like how insistent it is with notifying you to complete tasks second i wish the interface had a better tutorial so that it would be easier to have the due dates and such easy to prepare when you enter the task in since fixing one would fix both this is still a great app
__label__3 fix permissions for 5 stars great design and ui but you shouldn't need access to my contacts to login with my google account google provides an api for it that all other apps use without contacts permissions
__label__5 i tried many apps but honestly this app is very awesome
__label__3 this is unforgivably close to perfect why no timer so many tasks are long term and need to be chipped away at bit by bit you could have it where once a task was selected the timer would start and you would earn a certain amount of experience and coin for every x amount of minutes completed as it is i have two pair this app with a different promodo app
__label__3 the app is great for the most part i just wish that the 'notification option' for tasks would actually alert me no alarm or even a pop up message i got this to help me remember to take care of certain things due to memory issues but it's not gonna be of any help if i can't even remember i have the app please fix the alarm notification system
__label__1 bruh i literally have no clue how this app works
__label__3 i do not understand how i will add events i tried adding events but it only shows up in my calendar not at the sectograph it seems to be useful but i need to know how to make it work
__label__1 using the app since years now whenever open the app trying to save an entry full page advertisement opens for atleast 30 seconds causes missing what more to enter on different dates this app is at its worst
__label__3 ok
__label__3 i'm giving this app 3 out 5 because there is a really annoying behaviour when you're adding a quick note and if you by mistake tap outside the text box which one would do on the go your note is erased and you need to start again i'm considering uninstalling it because this happens almost every time i add a note which means that it takes me twice the time please at least keep the text and don't erase it in case of an accidental tap outside the box thanks
__label__3 repeating tasks seriously need to be automatically added to 'my day' view on their due date each time it would also be useful if there's an additional option to automatically delete completed tasks instead of just hiding them
__label__5 this app is perfect for my personal task management you can make it as simple or complex as you want i like how easy it is to quick add tasks schedule and how i can integrate with gcal every idea i have to do anything goes in here i need reminders for everything i even use todoist to remind me to change the sheets
__label__5 best app for daily life
__label__1 hi have been looking for a app which remind me each and every hour because i'm a student and i need a that kind of app but in your application this feature is not available
__label__3 my settings kept on changing ever time i reopen the app for example fear is set to zero when i open the app again fear is set to 80 why please fix this it's getting tiresome to re do the settings over and over
__label__3 expecting better need alarm facilty to remind me in advance
__label__3 the app is overall good just bought the upgraded version since i wanted to sync the google calender i still cannot sync the google calender into the calender and also would like to know if sync the 'routine' from timetune into the google calender is possible thanks
__label__2 you want me to pay 5 for the full version so i can set a task to repeat my phone's planner does that for free
__label__1 this app will not update nor uninstall properly fix it and i'll try it again
__label__5 this is a superb organisational app it met my needs when i was hunting around to replace another to do app that failed with an upgrade i would recommend this to anyone
__label__3 nice but it's really irritating that you can't edit frequency or a start date but i could live with that unfortunately when your schedule circumstances change you have to create a new habit because you can't change days and frequency edit thanks guys for the prompt response fingers crossed the update with this feature is released soon
__label__3 not giving 5 stars because of the following reasons 1 it's very annoying when you enter into a habit page and you swipe down to scroll down to see stats but it switches to another habit page please fix this it's counter intuitive 2 no method to edit the habits online on pc or mac limits the app to smart phones only otherwise it's a good app does what it is supposed to do
__label__5 easy to use great colors love it
__label__2 it's a great app really nice features does everything it says on the tin but let me tell you a productivity app won't do what it's meant to do unless it's usable offline i really loved using it but now i'm going back to the good old bullet journal
__label__1 i tried adding the pro for 7 99 because i thought you could set daily reminders by just marking repeat daily it doesn't do that or any of the things i was hoping for i have had it less than 24 hours and would like a refund i have sent emails asking for help and haven't received anything back so i just want my money back and this app gone
__label__3 near to ideal but there is some shortage for example there is no option in settings to add planned tasks to my day automatically or people usually plan tonight for tomorrow but when i at the end of the they add tasks to my day they add to today not tomorrow there is must be an optional boundary time in settings that determine the end of day and after that adding tasks to my day go to tomorrow another thing i cant add step s to my day its important
__label__3 a very beautiful app let down by the lack of subtasks and list item's lack of notes
__label__2 i've been using this app for more than 5 years it was great but currently i changed my phone and found out that syncing doesn't work anymore it says something like no internet connection so at the end i have to use another app
__label__5 helpful app
__label__4 nice app
__label__3 i cant log in after because i need to add a username i did it but the app froze when i was adding my username and now it seems is taken when it wasn't i tried again with a different one and happened again
__label__2 no monthly recurring reminder features can't even remind me when to pay the bills
__label__1 can't get account created tried linking facebook and straight account creation will not let me progress past sign in page
__label__3 soo bugy
__label__3 but i miss the hourly blocks made it easy to sceduale my work hours
__label__2 ok good to know thanks it still won't show all of my calendar items on the clock i'll put some on and it will take them off as i add more
__label__5 nice
__label__4 several features are limited if you don't have the premium version but it's still really useful i use the widget on my homescreen very often
__label__2 why doesnt the widget remember to sort by date i have to keep going into the app to select sort by date can this be fixed
__label__5 habitnow is a great app well thought out and the colours are good no dark mode in free version but i don't see that as a reason to give less than 5 stars has helped me to organise aspects of my life
__label__1 do not use this app for tracking your habit for long time you'll lose your data if you do t pay the premium membership i've lost 3 months of daily tracking data of my habits
__label__4 good apps however i want to quit the subscription could u help me
__label__5 such a good app to track my habit also become a reminder for my self when i wanna build a habit
__label__3 crashing a lot after update
__label__1 i regret using it well the apps itself is fine i have used it for over 6 months it's easy to navigate it's not ideal but understandable to have the export calendar function as a pro feature but then my phone malfunctioned and i was unable to access this apps there is no online syncing or a web version so that i can refer back to edit i have try the syncing method in faq most of my calendars are local calendars which i fail to sync or switch them to google calendar
__label__3 loved it except that it wouldn't save and show me all of my events
__label__1 downloaded this app hoping for a fun way to form new habits but when i get to the register screen the first two tutorial panels are blank and then the third one lets you link social media accounts then i can't save the username and display name i create and the avatar generator screen doesn't load any options opened the app the next day to find nothing i could edit had been saved uninstalled and tried registering again with a different account and got the same results pretty disappointed
__label__5 it is amazing app
__label__3 i love this app so far but i cannot access the store to buy more trees and plants which is a huge bummer i love all the special little guys that need to be unlocked
__label__4 i'll give it a 5 5 once yall make it functional offline like maybe allow us to edit cross off tasks offline and let it automatically sync once connected to the internet
__label__3 gets a on the phone list of things to do done
__label__4 it's an essential daily time management app it can further improve by providing the more detailed analysis and auto suggestion for the activity based on past routines further the routine creation can be simplified by providing the 1 step auto update functionality along with individual task creation functionality currently provided
__label__3 does not show dates of bookings as it used to detect from emails
__label__2 it's slow it'll be better if it works offline
__label__1 broken so far not impressed i bought this expecting multi device sync and haven't seen it do that it wouldn't even restore a backed up file after logging off then on
__label__3 one problem with this app is it stops and also notification also hide and ask for refresh and troubleshooting then it again start show every time i have to open the app and refresh then it start working this must be solve
__label__3 continue to get sync error on this app only can use web and see tasks cannot figure out how to fix i've uninstalled this app sever times logged in logged out stopped app cleared cache etc nothing corrects it
__label__5 if you're really serious with creating and tracking new habits within your life then this app will be very good for you
__label__1 beginning setup wasn't loading at all signed up using facebook since it was not loading i just clicked next now i'm stuck with my avatar with no way to change
__label__3 wish microsoft could copy wunderlist features properly before killing it i am already missing wunderlist
"__label__3 i liked its features these are well thought through if i could go back in 
timeline it would have been better"
__label__1 using the free app but disappointed that i can only integrate one week of my calendar i use another free app tha allows me to integrate my full calendar and allows me to color code the entire app
__label__1 cannot share entire calendar and or task database with other users only single daily task shares or individual list collaborations edit very solid low 1 star 0 if i could since the developer couldn't even be bothered to read the entire of two sentences of review acknowledging what features they did have
__label__4 good except notifications also vibrate and there's no way to disable vibrations for this app
__label__4 the app is good and in general highly customizable but it has one flaw it uses days 24 hours periods as a basic unit of measure but it doesn't let you change the default starting hour midnight this is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night i would rate it as a 5 stars app if i could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly
__label__1 new update has ruined the app the reminder option is no longer available with ringtones why the heck should i keep this app now in my phone deleting
__label__4 after the latest update the forest has been removed coin count and tree purchase history is up to date but the entire forest is gone synchronization does not fix the issue i did not reinstall app as per the in app warning not to what the hell update after two weeks issue was fixed
__label__5 this app have good design and good features i am using this app for 2 weeks and i comfortable with this app
__label__1 i like the app overall but can't stand the monthly subscription there should be one time payment to access useful features
__label__4 easy to use and does it job to keep me on track
__label__2 please remove the annoying and intrusive ads
__label__1 don't know how to use it because many icon were showing to upgrade to new version popups
__label__1 lag all the time
__label__4 great app
__label__1 your app sucks now used to be good but now doesn't update until i physically open it up and then close it then scroll and then it finally shows what i want to put on the list and i friggen paid for this garbage
__label__3 decent app but would be so much better if you could set the worth of your tasks some tasks are simple like 'drink more water' others like 'save 2000' theres nothing but a crude difficulty rating to differentiate tasks we cam create rewards and their worth why wouldnt we have control of the amount of points for the tasks
__label__3 i would really like to see the inbox feature in wunderlist brought over there is currently no efficient way to quickly add tasks so you can sort organize them later on the main page there is only an add list button and i don't want to add everything to my day this gets cluttered and messy it would also be nice if tasks that you have assigned for a certain day are automatically added to my day instead of having to go through and look for tasks that are due and add them to my day manually
__label__4 this app is so amazing
__label__3 doesn't open in weekly view even though i have it set to do so color scheme could be more attractive or a greater variety of colors provided to choose from when you like or dislike a motivational quote it disappears forever so if you really like one you should never rate it community discussion forum is a nice concept but there are no dates on the posts so i have no idea how old they are otherwise it's a good tracking app
__label__5 such a great app for reminders etc all the functionality and features i would like to have seen in the now redundant cortana for android are in this app nice ui great features and a pleasure to use would like to see integration with calender and a feature to add travel such as flights etc but in the meantime still an excellent app
__label__4 mkbhd suggested this app the free version is very good gets my work done
__label__4 this is pure magic juat saying best life app out there keep up the great work im ao happy you listen to your customers edit now my entire household is using this app its amazing magic easy to use only thing i noticed is that when you claim a reward if it has an increasing cost sometimes it will spend the gold after the increase instead of before resulting in extra gold loss my best guess is that the script might be changing the cost value before subtracting the gold from the players gold
__label__5 awesome app
__label__3 overnight events ie 8pm 4am show up as all day events in the calendar if they are repeating then two all day events are shown need to fix this asap
__label__2 app was perfect for me untill the last update where i lost all of my coins i had almost 600 and now i have 0 hence the 2 stars otherwise great app
__label__4 i love how easy this app is to use the only disadvantage is that you can track only 5 habits for free if you want to use it for more you have to buy the pro but what it does it does well
__label__1 gives a cheap buy once option for android users but for apple users a more expensive yearly subscription price which is very discriminatory
__label__3 good app however i have upgraded to pro version yet after twice usage now i can not open forest at all this issue also happen before i update forest i thought upgrading to pro will prevent from this issue editted hi i have sent an email to the address you mention the mail suggest me to disable the auto update uninstall then reinstall the app i have done it all for two days it was okay yet today i can not open the app anymore just like before the app is keep crashing
__label__3 i like this app very much because it's fairly easy to use and it allows for actual ring tones to be used not just notification tones however my biggest issues are that i cannot receive any notifications from the planner if the event was created on my phone's calendar i'm assuming this is the issue since only half or less than half of my total events and tasks do not sound it also will not sound when i have reminders set for many different times it's original default reminder is 15 minutes before the event time but i changed it to be on time and then i would make other reminders if need be it will only sound at 15 minutes before the event time no matter what i tell it to do
__label__5 just started using it seems to work quite well
__label__4 mkbhd suggested this app the free version is very good gets my work done
__label__3 why isn't this also an android wear watchface
__label__4 very nice app and easy to use my only complaint is that i wish there was an option to have a weekly view in block format like a planner versus just the timeline but it is still very convient to use the routines
__label__5 amazing even if you are not a nerd really helpful
__label__3 i wanted an app that would allow me to create grocery lists from web desktop but access them from mobile at the time of writing this functionality still isn't fully working grocery lists are categorized on mobile but the web version just shows a single list with all items mixed together auto categorization has been working on mobile since 2018 but the developers still have not bothered to port this important feature to desktop also i feel that far too many of the options are locked down for premium users even trivial options like background colors
__label__1 alarms and notifications don't work which is crucial to an organiser
__label__5 top
__label__3 not as good as wunderlist simple things make it less usable than its predecessor such as 1 sharing internet page to a list and the list defaults to my day instead of one of your choice or the last one you opened makes adding lots of pages in a row slow 2 add new task from the widget puts it at the bottom of the list not the top 3 marking a task with a star doesn't move it to the top of the list other than that it looks smart and imported my old wunderlist lists on 2nd attempt
__label__1 the app per se is good sadly the customer service when you have an issue is no where to be found for about a month i have sent emails since the app after an update went back to basic even after paying the pro version about 3 years ago no help has been provided after all this time in my view you can make it or break it when you take care of your paying customer or ignore him it seems like they dont see it that way perhaps now they will pay attention
__label__2 great app alas i'm constantly reminded that hey btw there's a paid version which has the functionality you're looking for this is tiresome and the subscription based model just doesn't make any sense plus hey its expensive
__label__2 needs a dark mode
__label__3 i would have loved it if not for the fact that there is a problem with the widget on my huawei p20 unfortunately it gets stuck often and cannot click anything i tried removing the widget and re doing it now it doesn't even show my lists and i have to go into the app to check or add things which of course means once i'm done with the current ones i'll delete it a task app with no immediate access on main screen is not too helpful
__label__4 my mother was saying your maximum time limit was two hours with the phone but i always did more this app allowed me to stay focused on something else really recommend it
__label__2 since 2018 the app does not register some of the calander input apparrently due to poor internet connection now sitting next to the wifi router and entering all my appointments for january needless to say none were regesterred
__label__4 love it except i can't change the positive memes at the bottom anymore
__label__3 average features
__label__4 the best app for to do lists it does have a couple of minor issues the widget can become unusable once in a while stuck forever on the loading screen it can also take a couple of seconds for an item to be removed after you check it off on the widget
__label__1 not a bad app but the worst customer service and thw widgets dont work once you pay for premium just use the free version your more likely to succeed if you focus on less goals at one time anyhow dont buy premium when it turns out it doesnt work you wont be able to get a refund
__label__5 great app i like it just make a better looking widget and allow us to connect to samsung calendar
__label__4 this app is just simply awesome just one thing i missed was notification sound it won't ring when a task is due as a result i won't be able to know about the task if i ain't using my phone
__label__5 oke
__label__3 this app lacks a lot if you make a mistake editing you can't recover this can cause the loss of important information
__label__3 pro the functionality and ui are one of the best of these kinds of apps everything has a simple look to it but you can always go deep add a reminder here a folder there and do exactly what you want it to do con the feature i want the most more than 5 repeatable tasks habits is locked behind a subscription paywall and there is no reason for a subscription model i'd gladly drop a reasonable one time payment for it but not the asking price month after month i'm not rich and nether is my country all in all great if you can afford it frustratingly limited if you can't
__label__5 was able to get every thing done that i needed in a short simple manner thanks it worked for me
__label__2 i logged in with facebook i upgraded to the pro version checked the planner a day later and had to log in again now it says to upgrade to the pro version again and if i click it play says i'm already subscribed to it
__label__4 osm osm osm osm
__label__3 a few major issues 1 the addition of sections in projects is nice but not useful if they only appear in project view but not filters 2 the sections cannot be reordered to appear at the top of a list the can only be at the end of a task list 3 in filtered view pulling subtasks out of their parent task or non completable tasks is ludicrous duplicating them like that is silly at best
__label__4 it's a neat idea and i've i tweeked the display settings i was able to make it easier to read there are some features that could be explained better though overall it's a interesting way to see what's on your schedule
__label__4 so close to being the perfect app 2 things needed before i switch to using it 1 add ability to edit and change habit status for previous days sometimes i don't have time or forget to update my habits on the day of 2 ability to set first day of week for calendar i prefer monday
__label__3 haven't used it enough to truly rate it but it just seems like there could be some big innovation if you put more thought into it a lot of potential if you ask me though
__label__4 it's a great app for tracking habits so far i find that purchasing the premium app has been worth every penny
__label__3 still testing
__label__1 you block new entry on my existing list and force me to upgrade to premium if i won't to continue
__label__3 when you complete a task it disappears not a good function means you can't remember what you accomplished and you don't get the satisfaction of seeing a big list of things crossed out something list makers love
__label__4 quite useful little widget i only wish i had control over which calendar it used it seems to only pick up the google samsung and i would like to use the widget for my repetitive schedule and a second widget for my daily planner there is the ability to select which calendar within the google app i want to use but that just makes the calendar side messy two separate app calendar selection would solve this for me unless anyone has a better idea how i can get around this still thank you dev
__label__2 first i liked the free version but after a while it got annoying with all the advertisements
__label__4 can i have a feature where i can maintain a record of how many times i actually finished the activity i was putting in include that and it's 5 stars from me
__label__5 excellent app to get your daily tasks organised
__label__3 i love its functionality and the idea behind this but one thing is really missing in my opinion is the import of tasks meetings etc from the mails
__label__5 this applications are all there setting up you routine for the day and you can set appointments in advance
__label__4 nice but cost too much yearly to buy
__label__5 easy to use love that the automatically updates free version only has 5 trackers but honestly it's hard to focus on more than that
__label__4 the full version allows you to do this on the free version once you have completed a task you cannot see what it was
__label__5 a more in depth kind of to do list plus you get to monitor where the kind of activities you do would lead you in the long run good job
__label__3 i really like the app maybe just work on improving the graphs a bit more
__label__2 app is good but the programmer feature is bad i have created multiple small routines which i want to enable from programmer based on my work meetings for different days so if i have late meetings on wed and fri i want to enable a separate set of routines for these days similarly for weekends the programmer is allowing for just dates which is not the feature that i bought the pro version for i want small reusable routines that i can configure from programmer for days not periods of dates
__label__4 good but too many ads
__label__4 needs improvement
__label__5 this is the best app ever it helps me manage my time when im doing my online homework and not get distracted i tend to procrastinate a lot of times so i know for a fact this app is the best
__label__1 by default tasks are due today and it's not easy to find the option to change this i wanted to save time not spend time learning another tool uninstalling
__label__1 does not work properly does not update wit hcalendar entries worst thing cannot aak my money back
__label__4 great app with just about every function i want for a task list love the way it integrates with the calendar it used to work with google voice activation but that seems to have ceased
__label__1 do not install you have to pay for everything all you can do is write notes waste of time and storage
__label__5 really great for staying organized super easy to use
__label__4 this is a great app the ine thing that would make it better would be if it worked with google assistant google home amazon echo so i could make reminders in ticktick by voice
__label__5 great tool and wonderfully convenient app
__label__5 i love that all my calendars are integrated in one spot work school kids small business its pretty functional tracks meals to dos and water intake i'm thrilled to have something pretty to add joy to my day thanks beta team
__label__3 it's ok but new trees are way too expensive and only few change their form with the time passing you can also pay with app coins to buy sounds which are available all over the internet including other apps i would love for the developers to add new features tho
__label__3 its a great app but need to add a version were you can restore your notes if lost my app got erased by accident and i dont have any of my notes saved please consider adding to the app
__label__3 wish the reminder have had a repeat function e g every week so i don't have to recheck the tasks
__label__4 very helpful
__label__1 terrible when you get a new phone only about half my data transferred when i updated my phone months of scheduled events don't show up now not happy at all with this app
__label__3 the app works only if you do not press clear all apps while the app runs the moment you clear you can shuffle between other apps and use it as long as you dont reopen the forest app the app starts running again once you open it and it blocks other apps this needs to be fixed
__label__1 i am specifically looking for a gamified productivity app my review of yours which is very lacking dark theme is missing this one appears to be for 5 year olds can you make a non child app similar to this but for regular people not 5 year old rpg gamers i avoided yours for a long time but still nothing exists yet for adults i hate rpg cause i'm not an anti social loser but want to gamify my productivity with public leaderboards in an app thanks looks well made but i don't want it
__label__5 really easy to use and great for calendar blocking
__label__3 i really enjoy this app up until about an hour ago all of a sudden during a quest my party disappeared and my friends messaged me to ask what happened i have also tried to join a help guild to ask but the app wont let me join a guild or post in chat at all now please fix this bug so me and my friends can enjoy the app
__label__1 it worked for me properly only 2 to 3 days now it doesn't track my focused time most of the time i am using samsung's m30s phone and i use it offline i don't have internet access all the time please fix my issue otherwise it is totally waste of money
__label__5 this app has really helped me organize my schedule and block out my routines that don't fit into other time blocks and have smaller increments of type that are hard to see in other calendar apps i would recommend using for morning and evening routines
__label__5 love this app
__label__5 pretty cool app helps a lot to get into your new routine recommend to everyone
__label__5 my experience so far with this app has been great so far i have been able to track my top 5 habits that i want to implement and maintain the app has done a great job at making me enjoy meeting my goals i recommend this app i have not tried premium yet however will do so once i have more concrete research and evidence that it's works well too
__label__5 thus far i'm enjoying this app i feel absolutely motivated in completing a task and staying on track even when i feel like getting off track i'm reminded of the growth that's manifesting between my tree and myself thank you from the bottom of my heart for the best app ever looking forward to additional features
__label__3 i loooove this app but i have a note 10 it was destroying my battery i had to uninstall it
__label__3 i like how it allows me to set any number of reminders minutes hours days weeks in advance either by push notification or email but many little bugs pepper this app the calendar view will bug out and not map to the selected month from time to time the location field tries to be smart by giving you a 'maps like' autocomplete but this is annoying when you just want 'gym' for some reason the first letter of an event name isn't registered by autocorrect so 'event' turns to 'venting'
__label__2 it was decent at first but it stops working completely when i wanted to put a custom time reminder and it did not sync with my google calendar i ended up deleting it
__label__3 i wish one could back up his habits otherwise it a good straight forward app
__label__2 unable to delete a list there are no 3 dots on the top right hand side of my screen i dont have all the features it says it has i loved my wunderlist and tranferred everything to microsoft to do not sure i will keep it looking for other options
__label__4 very nice app very useful to be productive
__label__3 it worked great to start with but now i'm not getting task notifications and some of my events are not showing up on my calendar widget
__label__1 lose my time
__label__1 horribly simplistic i found after i had paid for premium that there is no way to change the due date on an existing task renders the program useless lacks other core functionalities but i would never ever have conceived that the due date on an existing task cannot be changed i was ripped off
__label__2 it is complicated
__label__3 it is good but you should add some predefined themes in the palette and not only allow the user experiment
__label__5 fantastic and simple app
__label__3 very useful app if you are in the habit of forgetting things but it has one major defect if you have set up a recurring reminder and if you miss one instance of that reminder further instances will never show up they are gone forever i had to pay a penalty fee for late payment into my credit card because of that ridiculous bug
__label__2 downloads the app but package file is invalid error pops up before completing installation
__label__3 i schedule a 9 a m meeting in pennsylvania while i'm in california but when i get to pennsylvania my 9am meeting is now off by 3 hours i would like the times to be fixed no matter where i am
__label__1 confusing and useless
__label__3 this app cannot be useful to me until it works with dav synchronized task lists for some reason it is able to load calendars from the davx app but not tasks
__label__1 full screen ads ruin it all i've been using this since it was just business calendar it was still 7 back then so i wouldn't buy it but would click the ads every now and then now with the full screen ads it's practically unusable also before the dev comes in with the stock the free version has ads response no duh it has ads we didn't pay for the app because its upfront cost is too high so we liked the corner ads now you force them to take over our screens uninstalled and 1 star
__label__4 habitica is the best productivity app i've used thus far it lasted me for months the quests are the most motivating feature and i was able to take down a couple bosses solo however motivation dried up weeks into my first fetch quest because despite being extremely productive i had no chance of finding even one shard unless you're comfortable teaming up with a bunch of strangers to take on quests there becomes a point when being solo makes the quest motivation feature impossible
__label__5 makes doing chores seem more achievable and really helps me see my progress in being a better human
__label__5 experience after my time on this app supper detailed and incredibly smooth the best part is how convenient the lay out is my style and ways of doing things changed right after i hit the open app button
__label__5 i was reluctant at first to use this app but now absolutely love it it's simple yet effective to track your habits and keep on top of to do list truly one of the best app i have used i seldom say or write any comments however just one niggly point would be the alarm where it doesn't seem to do anything even if i choose to have alarm on the reminder function if this could be resolved it would be awesome and would just go premium
__label__2 a few months ago it started to fail to sync with my employer exchange server i used to make it work manually but now it doesn't work even if i sync now
__label__5 love it
__label__3 kartais kalendorius pastringa neparodomi suplanuoti darbai užduotys
__label__5 it's very good works on mobile and pc and it's easy to organize you're able to nest lists and it's easy to move them between lists or between different days several different options for viewing your tasks by category by priority or by day or week
__label__1 annoying app i am back to wunderlist
__label__4 thought one drive would be included in the cloud list
__label__3 govind
__label__3 i have a moto e 1st gen and i updated forest app using google play result forest app gets a crash everytime i try to use it fix the bug it runs android kitkat
__label__3 i want to like it but the main thing i wanted it for is location based reminders when adding a location i hit star to save it but they aren't saved you have to manually enter the address every time i don't understand why everyone gets location based notification so wrong
__label__3 good idea but i cannot connect it with my smartwatch
__label__1 one of the main sticking points for me is how well an app does recurring tasks in particular not just fixed date recurrences but the ability to set the next date off the last completion date so many apps fail to offer this alas i could find no way to do a recurring task at all in spite of them saying it can be done so much less checking on this nuance i see no way of doing them at all fail moving on
__label__1 i hate this app shared lists aren't shared unless you send an invitation everytime you update the list i want my wunderlist back
__label__3 would be better if it could hide declined events
__label__3 it is mostly a boost to your own motivation if you are not motivated enough it ain't gonna work for you there is nothing to stop you from using phone otherwise even while the tree continues to grow plus growing a tree as it does is no real game or any incentive for that matter completing a painting or part of quest with every focused duration would have been so much better
__label__4 very cool
__label__3 was very happy with the widget but the refresh button stopped working outlook 365 edit events from google calendar are synced fine events from outlook 365 to mobile device sync fine but edit them do not sync them back manually refreshing from the widget does noting for outlook 365 manually refreshing in the app works without problems these are all actions when using the device nokia 6 1 and not in battery saving mode
__label__4 great app gets my day well organized but i can't easily search for items in the list i have to scan through all items one after the other takes time
__label__3 it doesnt work for what i was looking for something to track my habits not judge them i dont want to focus on if i succeeded that day i just want to have an idea of where i am in numbers
__label__1 i have been using this for more than a year now it was great this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered pls fix this issue thanks
__label__2 fantastic app a critical flaw one touch completion now when you brush the screen your tasks get set to complete and you can't find them easily updated july 25 the developer asked me to respond to comment thanks for responding don't fuss on my part
__label__5 fabulous app thank you
__label__3 there are some bugs in the latest version that i haven't had before it's always lagging and nothing is loading in the app
__label__1 remainder app for free that s what i thought this app was please don t waste our time it is very disrespectful for you to get people you say it s for free the app and it s not for free please don t do that its not nice to delete apps because you say lies lies are not good and if you play with my trust and the world trust you are not helping the world to be a better place you are helping to continue destroy i don't want to open no more apps i don t trust what they say
__label__3 incredibly useful service and thanks so much for creating it the app tends to be buggy but nothing that couldn't easily be worked around until the last update since the last update drag and drop sorting of to do and i suspect dailies as well subtasks checklists no longer works which is really frustrating at least the website works great as always it's just frustrating to have to run down to the computer to fix my lists
__label__1 the tree store does not work please fix other than that great app does what it intends to do
__label__1 looks really complicated and it's entirely prescription based i felt like i needed to take a class to learn it there are a lot of apps like this i'll try another one
__label__1 there is no time setting in this graph only dates that's while
__label__3 ticktick is one of my favourite productivity app but suddenly the habit tracker doesn't work or respond properly
__label__3 good app but you need to pay a subscription to use it fully there isn't an option to pay for the app outright which is a shame
__label__1 quite disappointed with this app is used to be fine for past years currently is really slow when checking my task and is so frustrating at times this app need improvement on the server and at times server down
__label__2 i used to love this app but i have bought a new phone and whenever i open the app it crashes and doesn't open i've already uninstalled the app and installed it number of times but still the problem exists please look into it asap
__label__2 i can t select weekly days which days i need remainder and this drawback of app best to go with other app
__label__5 it wasn't as intuitive as other organizational apps i've used but once i got the hang of it wow so many options to really get organized in a detailed way i love it
__label__3 good
__label__3 app did not properly import all data from wunderlist as microsoft claimed it would all of my 'created dates' for items in my list got wiped amd set to the current month day and year of when i did the import a couple days ago this would seem to be a simple table record to grab from the wunderlist database to transfer over to to do i would expect a cleaner and better qa'd experience from a company like microsoft this is as of build 151
__label__3 i better have it all
__label__3 interesting organizer but is there any other way to earn gems without buying them
__label__4 i like this app quite a bit it has more useful features compared to the normal samsung calendar app it does not however play well with google in that i can't ask google what my agenda is and have it pull info from this app lame hence 4 stars only not sure if that's a google thing or a thing for this app otherwise i like it a lot
__label__2 so you reskinned liferpg what's different here
__label__5 it worked fine at my first installation when i did a virus scan afterwards reminders or daily routines are not ringing please suggest me thank you i fixed it but notification sound is very short
__label__3 free version does what i need with the exception of undelete when accidentally clicking the wrong thing however the cost of pro version too much for just that feature
__label__1 no custom notification sounds really
__label__4 only been using couple days so far so good easy to get the hang of some functionality aspects could be enhanced but overall v glad to be with this app
__label__3 it's a cool app and it kinda helps me but you are forced to be a warrior it says you can change your class in the settings but there is no option
__label__3 average app no worth
__label__1 doesn't update changes live or correctly even was a waste of money for some basic app
__label__4 only thing i don't like is that when creating a recurring event the date doesn't show on the monthly view until you scroll over to the actual week of the event it would be a lot better if i could see those dates on the monthly view without having to scroll fix please for 5 star rating
__label__3 i just got this app about 2 days ago i love it i would give it if the developers added new features such as more affordable 20 year more stickers love variety journaling pages customizable to be added anywhere within the planner fully customizable upcoming event pages to help plan for weddings anniversaries birthdays graduations parent to be planning baby or adopted child showers valentine's marriage proposal
__label__3 limited use so far every time i i touch the calendar icon the app changes to calendar but will not revert back to watch face unless i uninstall and reinstall no back button
__label__5 good
__label__4 so far so good relatively easy to use i was really hoping to be able to check off routine items when completed trying to build up on habits so it would be great to be able to track completed progress calendar sync in pro verson went seamless however when i go to change a routine item because it conflicts with a calendar appointment there is not option to just edit that one tuesday its either all tuesdays or no tuesdays it would be great to see date options completed progress tracking
__label__3 highly user friendly but the free version lacks some of the useful features
__label__1 doesn't work error messages appear everywhere when i open the app
__label__3 authors please stop associating every extension with this app it's annoying this pops up when i try to open a jar file edit this means that excluding certain very popular file extensions svg pdf jpg when a file is opened from the files app business calendar opens this means if i try to open a bz2 file a androffice file odt or a jar file jar it's strange for me that open office files wouldn't open in androffice but instead business calendar opens instead
__label__5 awesome app with good ui i recommend everyone to use it
__label__3 i liked it but the due date you can't change only the due time also getting the feature up for the due time is hard enough so going to try a different app
__label__3 good idea but there is on reapeat routine i have to add evertime so make me hang more and its work only 12 hours basis
__label__5 helped me in organizing my time calendar blocking amazing app
__label__2 i like the options available but for some reason i can still go into other apps when i am planting only after i go back into the app does it give me the notification could i get some help
__label__2 crashes on sign in on my pixel 2 xl
__label__2 kept getting an unknown error has occurred please try again later tried on several devices on my t3 connection had no problem with other apps immediately after leaving this one uninstalled sad cuz it looked great in re dev's reply yes i did that i made sure it was plugged in and turned on too i did take a look at the apk and i've found an alternative for me for right now thanks
__label__3 must be a better reminder system to keep user in check in a busy schedule one might forget to check in
__label__4 i really like the app it's pretty cool how do i get the 24 hr clock on my android wear 5 stars if the 24hr face can is possible on the watch
__label__3 add all tasks as it was in wunderlist
__label__5 the best app in this area i could only suggest that a functionality is tracking the progress of a task could be offered a board with doing blocked completed etc columns
__label__4 overall impressive app but it does not updated in real time always showing delayed time until manual update
__label__1 i didn't even dare to use it as soon as it asked me 2 99 per month
__label__1 couldn't figure out how to set reminder times won't do anything other then am
__label__5 awesome app i now remember to take my medication drink my water and have my to do list it has been extremely helpful and productive
__label__3 the reminder system is not very robust and that should be one of the most important things i would like more than one daily reminder for everything i will do tasks at different times of the day thus i need reminders that are task specific it also requires a connection in order for you to set tasks and if you have no signal you are out of luck i do love the idea fix these two things and i'll reinstall
__label__4 easy to use smart and flexible options
__label__4 i am using pro version and its pretty well organised applicatiom among its competitors but my suggestion is that please make a significant difference in tree for varioua time period for example most of tree looks same at evry time period
__label__4 nice app
__label__5 this app is outstanding i love dark mode so i upgraded to premium it's 100 worth it excellent app great to organize motivate yourself thank you
__label__2 free version is all you need paid version is overpriced and a waste of google credits
__label__3 add seamless integration for office 365 accounts
__label__2 the alarm feature does not work which leads to missing the tasks
__label__3 i have to uninstalled this app on my phone soon i open the apps and trying to make things to do list it worked fine just i have trypophobia and those small circles dot just freaking me out edit the small circles dots that i mean here is when i click new list next we fill the list name and it appears with small circles dots in color for me who's having this kind of phobia that kind of design is just scary aside of that your apps seems to be simple and easy to use
__label__1 lost all my data when i moved to ios
__label__1 just they copied google calendar and charging on top of that google calendar so far better
__label__1 new android widget is garbage full control yea ok you took away useful features and gave us more theme options can no longer open app from widget and most importantly you can no longer select multiple tasks from the widget which was super useful for rescheduling
__label__3 still exploring the app but so far so good
__label__4 easy to use will continue further and decide if i will get the premium
__label__1 terrible
__label__4 i love everything about this app except for the fact that there isn't a calendar to put in to do's that have to be done on specific days if they added a calendar this would be a million star app i love everything else about it
__label__5 went very well before my payment for my premium subscription can not be proceeded please help me fix this issue thank you
__label__4 very good app to focus
__label__1 can't install the app
__label__4 ok so far
__label__2 one thing that i think is important and missing from this application after i move from wunderlist is synchronization with google calendar i did not find how to synchronize google calendar with this to do list application
__label__4 nice but cost too much yearly to buy
__label__3 very good app
__label__4 i was using wunderlist but this seems to be a great replacement it integrates very well with outlook 365 and the reminders are easy to manage would certainly recommend it for anyone looking to manage task lists
__label__1 paid for premium and now i keep getting ads after the update
__label__1 uninstalled as calendar events keep appearing under the wrong date disappointing
__label__3 widget non responsive suddenly u want to tick one item a whole lot of other items tht got clicked
__label__1 i am on a sony xperia xz premium android 8 0 0 and the app when i move out of the app and use others does not wither the try thus spoiling the point yes all my notifications and permissions are on please help so i can actually have incentive growing the forest there is no crisis notification when i move out of it or onto other apps
__label__3 overall it works but not so easy to use when you block out time the first and last day of the time block do not turn the same color as the rest so it can throw you off sometimes it's hard to set specific dates and the icons are limited
__label__3 kind of confusing to use but it does what is supposed to
__label__4 fine app would be perfect to have desktop web version also to make adding routine much easier
__label__2 tasks that i change dates does not move to the new date assigned i'm dismayed because i am a premium member moreover it doesn't have a 1 week or 7 day folder apart from the calendar i also want to see a 7 day list or folder
__label__1 i am not able to set the time it is automatically taking the remainder timing
__label__3 i liked but in my cellphone had some bugs galaxy a8 i think if this app had a function to sync with the phone calendar google calendar or samsung calendar it would be much better
__label__5 friendly app that help you to optimize your time
__label__5 this app is beautiful and has really helped me keep my business large family homeschool and church activities all in order no more chaos for this girl
__label__1 full screen ads you can't skip every time you add or edit an event
__label__3 ok
__label__4 it's good
__label__3 used to think it was a 5 star app but they keep making it worse and worse specifically it wrongly interprets touch screen movements putting tasks in random locations rather than where you drop them often the very end of all your tasks so you have to waste time dragging it back sometimes for dozens of items reminders bug me the moment i wake up won't switch off you only let me move a reminder 15m 1hr 3 hrs so with a list of 20 things i get 20 reminders 3 hrs later annoying as hell
__label__4 amazing for organizing my life
__label__1 can't even name my tasks
__label__5 lmmd
__label__4 almost perfect the only changes that would be helpful is a quicker way to switch from the week view to the task list and i would like to see my tasks as a list by default instead of clicking on the task categories also i wish that you had a rollover option for tasks i have yet to find an app that had this basically i wish when i create a task i could choose if the task carries forward to the next day if not completed or not
__label__4 it been running kind of slow when you're making new tasks
__label__5 excellent app good developper response thanks
__label__2 i loved this app at first but now when i change my task dates times it doesn't actually change them and continues to alert me at the original time even though i've clearly changed it it's very annoying
__label__5 the next best thing to the classic planner
__label__1 great app but why do you need 13 ad trackers in this paid for pro app exodus privacy list 13 trackers against your app which is rediculous using this every day but now concerned my every move is being tracked 13 times edit you inform so that makes it okay then for you perhaps other more privacy focussed users should look elsewhere how do i confirm the trackers are not used trust you i bet 13 are for revenue 1 will suffice for personalising
__label__5 using this app is a great way to organize assignments daily tasks appointments to do lists you can keep track of what is due and what has been completed i use it to keep track of assignments for all of my classes and it's so easily accessible and user friendly this app has helped me break my terrible habit of procrastinating i actually look forward to doing my homework just so that i can check off all the tasks on my list
__label__1 only option is paid subsctiption app no thanks i can't constantly pay for apps within my budget so i'd much rather have the option to use a version with ads
__label__4 it's a great app and the watchface is a perfect addition but it would be even more perfect if the 24h mode was a feature of the watchface and an option to switch between 12h 24h mode and open meetings by tapping the sector
__label__2 not very user friendly and very less interactive
__label__5 it wasn't as intuitive as other organizational apps i've used but once i got the hang of it wow so many options to really get organized in a detailed way i love it
__label__3 this is app is perfect just need a checklist and daily weekly and monthly tracker for each task had it been have all these i would have given all 5 stars you know sometimes we miss or intentionally ignore reminders and we need trackers for those for self development
__label__3 was really great but lately it has been killing my trees even though i'm not touching my phone at all it's kind of discouraging to come back after two hours of work and see that you now only have dead trees in your forest
__label__3 notifications are not persistent enough i'd love to have the option of using my phones built in alarm to remind me of tasks please consider this functionality
__label__3 notes and tasks are appearing twice
__label__2 new update is incredibly finicky and makes it difficult to add existing items to projects change dates etc appending a task with project_name no longer adds it to the project it just takes it as a string literal
__label__2 limited unless you buy the full version i spent time looking around trying to work with the app a lot of things i tried wanted me to upgrade which is why i found another i feel my review is fair sorry
__label__4 reminder popups are not displaying at the bottom of my screen on my new samsung galaxy s20 ultra they only appear in the notification area at the top of screen is this an android 10 issue how do i get the popups again it worked fine on my samsung galaxy s8
__label__2 great app but isnt optimized for google pixel 3xl i cant re size the widget to match the size of the screen
__label__4 great app for setting up to do list and setting skills very similar to liferpg differing only in ui and the addition of achievements in my opinion stuck with the other one of the basis of not wanting to pay a subscription for an app would prefer one off payment to unlock features
__label__5 helped get my life in a bit more order it could still use some tweaking 8 10
__label__4 great app just bought platinum my only issue is when setting my goal for a habit let's say i have a habit named '1 hour of study' and i set my goal to doing this 5 times a day even if i would only do it twice meaning 2 hours each day the app would show it as a streak even though i haven't reached my actual goal during any of the days so it does see it as a success even though it wasn't for me could you maybe implement an option to make it possible to show those as unsuccessful
__label__1 doesn't look like the pictures at all exact same layout as your phone's calendar now new settings etc waste of time app
__label__3 good app bit i am facing a perineal problem the option to select am pm is not working where the clock is shown this needs to be fixed as every time i select the time is defaults to pm
__label__1 i uninstalled it within 20 minutes of paying for it its features don't work as hoped especially font and color customization the unpaid version advertised presets aka themes but they didn't exist in the pro this is on an android 10 oxygen 10 3 1 tmus 1 6t developer your 2020 3 3 reply makes no sense it still doesn't take into account this particular phone or my specific terms here's to those themes in future releases along with a dynamic icon and the developer's professionalism
__label__3 great app
__label__1 unfortunately i can not sign up or sign in by google account or email i tried a lot from iran
__label__4 good
__label__3 how soon until the list sharing is available if soon you have just earned a small business customer
__label__4 sad that i lost all my progress when i uninstalled and reinstalled the app also i always get error code 2 when trying to get double coins from viewing the ad
__label__5 i've used this app since it first came out i've not seen any errors or bugs it is very very easy to use syncs with google calendar flawlessly and has more info and can be used offline i've used it to synch with friends google calender

__label__2 i have been using this for a while and found it to suit my needs well i wanted something where i could see trasks and appointments in a daily view this accomplished that goal in an easy to read and navigate format however there must have been a recent update that has made the ads ridiculously invasive to the point that i no longer want to use this app i think i will start checking on alternate options
__label__3 it work absolutely fine but why every hour try to connect with facebook servers adguard noticed it
__label__5 i've been using the app for years and can't think of any improvements
__label__5 brilliant idea you are making chores and tracking your habits and progress so much more fun
__label__3 nice app the only challenge have seen is that sometimes the notifcation alarm does not work
__label__3 it's pretty good so far i'm still working on coordinating it with my other organisational apps
__label__1 constant connection drop outs will update review when this is fixed
__label__3 not working on my chromebook i cannot open any lists to view the contents edit issue seems to be resolved in the latest update though still only giving 3 stars since this is taking over wunderlists but is still comparatively lacking in design and ease of use
__label__5 this is a very useful app helps me a lot with my day to day task management
__label__3 this is a great app and it really helped me do my tasks but it doesn't work properly for example when i try to move a habit so that the list is in the order i want it to be the app glitches and the habit is sent back to the top i know those problems are almost insignificant but it gets seriously annoying sometimes fix those little problems and i'll give this app the five stars it deserves
__label__3 awesome helps me to stay focused and doesn't let me to open any other app while studying but after using sometimes i can't open the app only i even restart my phone but it is not working
__label__2 good application but keeps crashing after trying to double rewards
__label__4 i like this app and use it on my android phone and ios ipad it's easy to use don't need to buy anything and is clear i don't love how some tasks are harder to remember and the reminder isn't how i expected but it's a good app
__label__2 not a bad app but dont pay for the premium the widgets dont work
__label__4 great app stability is still a bit shakey but you never lose anything even if there is a crash join this community if you are serious about getting your act together and having as much fun as you can while doing it you get what you put into this and you don't have to pay a penny if you don't want to but in my experience when you meet the amazing people this place attracts you'll find yourself getting more and more involved and wanting to contribute however you can
__label__5 i use this app everyday so many lists camp groceries movies to watch
__label__5 still the best habit tracker i've ever used unfortunately the widgets only respond directly after i've removed and replaced them again i'm really hoping they work some day
__label__4 i've been using this app for a couple of months now and it's pretty good at helping to develop and track new habits
__label__1 the last update was more than a year ago and things started to stop working the company that owns it seems to be a scam it was a great app i paid for it and got no support
__label__4 love the app was able to download it to my iphone i went to download it to my samsung tablet but once i hit open all i get is black screen i uninstalled the app and reinstalled it several times and it still won't work
__label__3 so far it's not flexible enough for me also there needs to be an option to remove 'general discussion ' from the dash board there seems to be a startling number of people with goals surrounding masturbation and porn and i just don't need to see that when i'm trying to inspire myself to play more music i'm going with the stars as a benefit of the doubt as i haven't given it much time but i can't see me using this
__label__2 i hate when the things are no clear basic features as reminders are in the premium membership
__label__4 go overall application i wish it was easier to make changes in already established recurring appointments and it would be nice to have a refresh button everything else works really well
__label__5 convenient colorful features and settings cater to list lovers i've always enjoyed hand writing lists for everything had zero interest in switching or including tech for list making i had to install 'tasks' to make a list during an apartment move in evaluation to my paperless surprise there were more issues than i thought i could recall from memory ended up making four lists w this app on the 1st day now i'm listbidextrous got twice as many w both written app made lists
__label__1 advertising everywhere now so bye bye
__label__5 since i linked it with a smart watch i've been able to make the most out of everyday which is huge since i used to do nothing due to indecision i've scheduled time for both professional stuff self improvement and working through my backlog of movies and games super easy to use too and good backup support i switched phones and all my routines were imported solid app
__label__3 i preferred wunderlist i wish ms kept more of its functionality
__label__3 i gave it a lower rating because lately if i had any repeat scheduled appointments i can't change one without changing them all very aggravating before i was able to cancel one without affecting all the future repeat weekly or monthly entries before i could use this calendar to keep track of my past activities now it looks like i attended a meeting when i didn't because i couldn't cancel it without affecting future meetings
__label__2 the main feature does not work it doesn't remind me about todo with system notification
__label__3 unconfortable interface requires an internet connection often freezes
__label__5 super
__label__3 the widget freezes a lot the calendar is not intuitive to use
__label__3 the app would be nice and work well if it wasnt for this 1 issue but its a pretty big issue as far as daily planners go it only shows half of a clock or calender in the create event task subscreen meaning i can not select any times that would fall on the right hand side of the clock or i can not select a due by date for tasks because the right side of the calender is missing i would already own the full version if it wasnt for this problem
__label__4 great idea and i'm enjoying it so far chores and errands are much more fun my one gripe so far is that it seems like most items quests cost gems which are pay to play i'm afraid i'll pretty quickly run out of free items quests to strive for and then the app will lose its effectiveness it'd be helpful if their were other ways to unlock gems outside of paying for them like reaching extra high levels of productivity habit building etc
__label__1 too greedy on the premium features i'm not going to pay monthly for the ability to add a description comment to my task without this you have a one liner for the task there are tons of alternatives that do the same things as this app i tried this one the premium features don't interest me and the rest isn't worth a subscription
__label__3 ok
__label__5 amazing love this app not only good but also fun maybe at the first is difficult to set a lot of thing but after that is amazing
__label__3 please add data synchronisation with google drive so when we change device we can get our old data on signing in
__label__2 after last update the widget became very small and clicking on it does not open up the full app also won't sync to my calendar anymore uninstalling
__label__5 absolutely fantastic clean fast non intrusive
__label__2 i purchased it but it still showing i dont have premium account the money is debited from my account but i haven't get premium app please consider this
__label__2 please add a feature that make me add a friend to the habit such as habit competition app i can't live without this feature
__label__4 it's a good app for task reminder but it still needs some thing more one needs to go into the menu to switch to the lists no matter which list has an upcoming task it should have option to show the mix of tasks from all lists in tiles widgets on app home interface i really like the snooze option quite straight away
__label__1 there are more effective and honest ways to turn a buck in the playstore crippling your app with a paywall only drives home just how unnecessary the app is
__label__2 i like how this become my favorute game because it keeps me doing things but it is constanly in problem crash unable to load bug not processing and i don't understand why the task constanly can't be arranged
__label__3 i'm editing my review due to the new update dear todoist the new update made it nontrivial to change the project of a task on the app i have to click on the three dots then on move project this should be as simple as changing the label please be so kind to the users and fix this great app does exactly what i need it to do extremely simplistic and elegant yet functional design i would tweak one little thing or too but overall todoist is almost a perfect product
__label__1 i had given 5 stars in jun 2017 i'm changing it to 1 star because of the full screen ads which cannot be dismissed i'm grateful to the developer for creating this nice looking calendar app and was happy to tolerate the ads in the free version but the full screen ads really disrupt the process of adding an event to the point where it becomes intolerable i'll just switch to google calendar which syncs better anyway thanks for the few years of a great app
__label__4 great app only one disadvantage no backup possible
__label__4 simple app that provides all i need to track habits ui could use a refresher
__label__1 cant use if i dont allow permission for contacts dumb
__label__3 nice and useful app feels quite buggy though and the party chat goes the wrong way if you're used to any other chat app
__label__3 the new video ad is really annoying it pops out and no way to close it unless you close the entire app it really interrupt when you want to add a few appointments to the calendar
__label__1 did not work
__label__1 i don't understand why the app has all the languages except the arabic language
__label__2 if you want to start a project you have to pay 4 99 a year
__label__1 i once rated this app and company a five star however long with their recent updates they have utterly failed to test the user experience all the alerts settings are changed so you get texts notifications and emails when you had turn them off the suggested time zone change so their app will function correctly breaks the assigned due date times i like to see companies trying to improve but if they are this lazy with the user experience who lazy are they with customer data lost of all trust here
__label__4 great app and i want to import my calendar so that i can replace my calendar widget with it but i cant buy the pro version i tapped purchase once to see the price then hit cancel in the google pay modal now whenever i tap to buy it i get a modal saying that in app purchases are not enabled on this device google play services is installed and works normally with other apps and worked fine the first time i tapped to buy
__label__5 awesome app very good at keeping me accountable
__label__4 i really like it i think it's a really cool concept to have characters to build up with the habits only thing i wish were there is to be able to have notifications for term less habits
__label__2 well designed and all however alot of the crutial features are locked behind the premium which u need to pay for
__label__3 back button doesnt work
__label__3 i like this app it's simple and gets the job done only downside is you're allowed to track up to only seven habits without the premium version
__label__4 i'm a wunderlist user for years generally this app is good just lack 2 important features 1 weekly view that includes overdue tasks 2 mark overdue task date in red on widget
__label__4 great app to keep tight training schedules and regimes premium isnt necessary only downfall would be reminders notifications more than once
__label__1 deceptive billing practices information on cancelling is circular emailed a link that advises to email doesn't have colour tag functionality across web and app very poor ux and worse customer service
__label__3 i love the app but recently the widgets have been glitching they go blank or sometimes do respond when i click a checkbox
__label__2 i am facing problems importing my lists from wunderlist
__label__4 very helpful for me to list out my works
__label__3 this is by far the best to do list app i've come by it has rich features and a great interface even in the free version it knows the difference between a task and a habit my main issue here with the app is premium pricing why exactly do i have to pay a monthly fee for features that can be used offline normally a monthly subscription is to support features that need to be consistently paid for from what i can see there's only one if a one time payment option is added i'll buy it
__label__4 i liked this app i would like to recommend one more thing please add the schedule to calendar as well as right now it is getting all calendar events but it will be great if all the schedule will also get saved at calendar
__label__5 very easy to use i have the free version connects with my google calendar and i share with my partner i do have to manually sync through as it doesn't update automatically very well overall very happy with this app
__label__3 bom mas tudo tem que pagar
__label__3 over the years the platform has become stagnant i was a huge proponent of habitica using it for a few years and even paying for a subscription to support development but development beyond bug fixes never happened it's a good tool with a potent gamification component but they've failed to continue to make it engaging and interesting and certainly not worth paying to support
__label__5 happy i just found out this amazing app i love devs from israel not discriminating others tho but i have a thing about calendar view it shows different month other than the current month same with the today's date it shows other dates hmmm maybe i clicked or touch something help
__label__3 conflict strack
__label__2 a few months ago it started to fail to sync with my employer exchange server i used to make it work manually but now it doesn't work even if i sync now
__label__1 why are you counting inactive habits for the 5 habits total it's ridiculous there are many other apps that don't have this silly cash grabbing limit
__label__1 way too expensive
__label__3 ads were annoying and it took a lot of steps to set up tasks however it was nifty to use and definitely allowed a lot of control due to the aforementioned steps
__label__3 it's useful but the recurring task feature is a pain in the free version
__label__4 pretty cool but it needs a diary that keeps full logs of your activities and performance it's pro reliable but it's important to know sometimes the service goes down and doesn't work it's pretty rare though
__label__3 the app is good but the reminders for some of the habits are not working i have bought the pro version
__label__5 good app recommended
__label__3 ok
__label__3 it's decent but the google tasks integration is bad it's set to hourly sync but doesn't actually update tasks unless i manually trigger it the repeating tasks data is not synced with google if it's due to repeat in bc but i tick it off on a google webpage then it's gone no repeat i'm also having a problem with notifications appearing later than they should all in all i'm going back to google calendar
__label__1 v v v v bad
__label__1 confusing and useless
__label__5 update changed to 5 stars due to the price changes in the store the pop up ads are still a little annoying but it's still not too much of q problem i love the variety in plants you can buy it's a really cute app occasionally an ad would pop up outta nowhere but it's not too much of a problem i think it'd be nice for the bushes to cost lower than the trees due to them not needing as much time off to grow but that's just my opinion
__label__5 the app i was using before was closing and changing into something else so i did some research and this was very popular rightly so as i prefer it to what i was using before great app
__label__4 it's a cool app but essential features are premium
__label__3 not free free upto only 5 habbits
__label__4 this is by far my favorite habit tracking app and i've tried many i like the weekly view i have an unusual use for this app i use it to track my kids' school work and i like the weekly view so i can see what they have completed during the week however i'm not sure if this app is still being supported the last update was over a year ago and they do not respond to inquiries but the app does still work well
__label__4 very good
__label__2 loved ticktick great interface and the widget was perfect unfortunately i had to move on to todoist ticktick doesn't have alexa capabilities and that's a deal breaker for a while ifttt and gmail provided a good workaround but recent changes to gmail rendered that functionality inoperable ticktick get on board with alexa and i'll come back
__label__2 i used to love this app it worked flawlessly for me and it was my go to calendar app however recently i am having trouble where it does not sync anything other than my single outlook calendar with my other calendars being visible from my phone but not having the events also populate on my laptop this is a huge problem for me and definitely a deal breaker if this can't be resolved i'll have to start looking elsewhere for a calendar it still is a nice calendar app but if you want seemless integration between your phone and your laptop look elsewhere
__label__1 beware the trial period is a scam i've been using the free version for a while and decided to try the premium for 7 days per the trial ad after 5 days i realized it didn't quite organize my information how i best work so i wrote to cancel they informed me that i must have accidentally signed up for a non trial and by their strict terms cannot refund me so i wrote back nicely that my intention was to try it per the ad but they said it's not possible really
__label__5 it is great simple as that
__label__1 the google calendar integration is riddled with bugs and it has been this way for months they don't fix it and they are pretty slow on their communication ticktick is becoming very tempting
__label__1 i bought the premium long ago unable to sync after resetting phone lost data that i have tracked for over 2 years
__label__4 it has been an effective motivator and tracker for me to accomplish the smaller tasks that get me closer towards my bigger goals but there seems to be a bug i can't seem to receive a friend's party invite though i am able to create my own party and invite friends to it it's a one way street in my app joining guilds and the self care self sabotage info have been most educational and helpful
__label__4 overall a decent todo app it does have some things or desperately needs 1 why can't i see the event time in the list i can see the day but not the time 2 why can't i sort by time again i can sort by date but i can't look at the list and see what's coming next
__label__5 just amazing
__label__1 ever get a phone call from a salesman whom you don't remember giving your phone number out to this is the app that does it it reads your phone number and identity and uploads it to the cloud where it can later be sold to the highest bidder this app makes sure that it gets your identity because you have to login before you can even use it once you log in the game is a huge disappointment mypoli has everything over this
__label__4 good experience
__label__3 app needs work poor sync with website
__label__1 please add reminder or show me how to sett
__label__3 i really like the idea of this app but it doesn't function well for me i'm a musician and i tried using it for practise but i had to use an metronome in the phone and then the tree always dies i wish it was possible to let it grow without having to look at it all the time maybe also a pomodoro function
__label__1 mostly features are for premium account and you can not delete account once you create disappointed with to this app
__label__4 pretty good app lets you organize tasks by categories prioritize based on due dates and set reminders for each specific task however sometimes reminders fail to notify you in the specified time and come rather delayed
__label__1 very expensive for a simple app and quite useless without buying the premium only tracks 5 habits lame i can't believe this is the app advertised in the play store and still has a high rating because it is garbage sounds like even if i bought premium it would be worthless for transferring data to a new phone as the app claims i won't even risk it
__label__5 seriously impressed with such a simple app it's helped me go from writing list after lists in notebooks and losing them to having it all on my phone whilst i'm out and about very convenient i've already recommended to everyone i know who is like me with staying organized also being pregnant and having baby brain i find it hard to remember to take medication so having a little reminder instead of an alarm is really handy the snooze options are a wicked bonus thank you
__label__3 i think the app is satisfaying my will but the pro version keeps a non ecard user not happy so im giving you 3 5 bcuz of this
__label__3 notification is not of up to my expectation need to keep on reminding us until we check or tick it besides that the way of organizing the tasks and prioritizing them are perfect i do love to continue using it if they update the notification part
__label__3 i have been using bc2 for a long time i generally like it but the month view widget just stopped displaying my calendars unless i hit the refresh button i use nova launcher please help
__label__5 love this app i'm much more organized with it
__label__1 want to like it so far half of the set up items aren't even showing up for my samsung s8 all the purple screens are blank was excited to try but it doesn't work
__label__4 it's a good app but has some errors if a close the app a can use every app of my phone for example it will be more fun if one can interactore with the forest play with it or change the form idk
__label__5 great app to track your daily tasks it is very customizable
__label__5 goodd
__label__3 works great but when i start creating events and switch to a different app and go back to business calendar they disappear also very limited unsearchable collection of emojis no statistics on events too would also love to see goal tracking needs prioritizements of tasks also no option to find a time for an event
__label__2 no search option mixing up of completed and incolplete tasks in list mismanaged
__label__1 its always lagging and hanging up and not moving and ive cleaned my phone storage and its still the same un installed installed it 3 4 times already but its still the same i dont know what it is about the app but one more crash i'll never go back to using this app and tell my friends to do the same sheesh
__label__3 i really like it but there's one or two thing's that need to be addit i personally use it to make a list of book that planning to buy and read this year i know there's other apps for this but love the check list style but i don't like how it get deleted after 30 day at most it will be great if there is option for never delete plus adding a imagine option will be nice like wallpaper behind the task name
__label__5 love it it has completely changed my life i couldn't have become more adult like without habitica
__label__2 the current day shows events for the next day and seemingly no option to change it very annoying
__label__3 this app would be better if it support jalali shamsi date format
__label__1 the whole point of a to do list is to remind you to get things done with the help of a numeric badge count since they can't be bothered to add this feature the app is useless to me you just loss a potential lifetime user who would have even paid a subscription to have that one feature other apps can offer badge counts through launchers such as evie don't give me the excuse that android is not developing this feature
__label__5 helped motivate me get back on track after a big downswing just the idea of keeping a simple chain going helps so much i guess it's because it's like a promise to yourself decided to get the premium it's not expensive either so i think it's completely worth it i'm very grateful that someone recommended this app to me when they did
__label__4 really needs and undo button gesture or shake to undo it's hell of a problem to find accidentally completed tasks
__label__2 android keep blocking the app from sending notifications i've re downloaded it and put an exception for it in the battery settings to work without interruption but nothing happens fix it
__label__3 doesn't offer too many options to notes and writing listing text fonts and sizes tools and resources are very simple and limited
__label__3 great app just need one thing is second hand also like minutes and hours the i will 5 star and its best app
__label__5 love it so far excited for the coming soon items i use a paper planner bc digital planners never seem to have the layout i want but so far this seems to be a great replacement
__label__2 good
__label__1 poor replacement for wunderlist so many features missing my day isn't something everyone wants but can't turn off can't reorder my lists manually will use different app when microsoft kill wunderlist
__label__1 mostly features are for premium account and you can not delete account once you create disappointed with to this app
__label__3 great app lots of ads
__label__3 love it but it has some major flaws 1 can't personalize theme 2 can't configurate widgets' toolbars what details are displayed 3 the widget's size is too wide max 4x would love it if it were more flexible 4 you cannot sort the notes on one day to be listed in alphabetical order on the day widget it will always be sorted by time 5 the app malfunctions when you place two widgets on the home screen 6 app stops working a lot for seemingly no reason
__label__5 the app works once and the second time i try to open it it just refuses to open i have redownloaded the app many times but this problem continues other than that i really enjoy this app edit i have sent the problems on the said email edit they did respond and the app works fine now excellent customer service
__label__4 how do i push back and or bump up a daily routine edit they answered my issue other than needing an easier way to do what i mentioned above i love this app very easy to use and very started i love that you can create your own tags too
__label__3 all my tasks are gone and unable to load anything
__label__3 stopped syncing properly at some point which drives me nuts because having an updated schedule on every device is very important for my job a
__label__2 still missing a bunch of essential features like send reminder to all users in a list and recurring reminders for certain time of the day too bad i really enjoyed the ui but those features are a must for me
__label__3 some of the premium features like location based reminders just don't work and it doesn't do everything it says in google play like automatically sorting my grocery list by aisle
__label__3 i don't see where you can use voice to make tasks
__label__1 i want to schedule a task daily should i add it every day what's the way
__label__3 i can't seem to create an anniversary or a birthday event like i used to please assist
__label__3 i can't be the only one multitasking therefore i don't have time to figure out a basic program i put in a picture and it was so tiny i put in my tasks yet some are timeless some are daily and there was powerlifting i'm physically crippled
__label__1 i cant no longer recommend this cant sign up on any platform and they servers are located in asia i wouldnt put any sensitive information on it they have nothing but server issues its very fischy
__label__5 too good
__label__2 not working on xperia e1
__label__4 it helped me to plan my day and also more productive
__label__1 sync doesn't work despite having a lifetime premium account as others have said
__label__3 the fact that the app does not let you use other studying apps that you have on your phone or google to find information is a bit annoying currently the only way to get around this is to collect all the information you need before turning on the app but that opens you up to distractions and wasting time i feel like this app is specifically designed for reading purposes only since i can sometimes finish homework before the timer runs out but the only way to stop the app is to kill the tree
__label__5 i refer to this app constantly it feels super rewarding to do things and keeps me motivated to do the tedious stuff i used to procrastinate on i love it
__label__1 this app just isnt for me
__label__3 real ly good
__label__3 zokay
__label__4 i used this all the time before and it was fun in the beginning but got really tired of the low res graphics if they were a bit more high def it would be amazing we could finally see the equipment customization better more motivating to continue using and complete tasks
__label__4 some reason just recently the app uninstalled itself or somehow or another it got uninstalled and i haven't been able to receive any updates or any calendar events for the last couple weeks
__label__4 ticktick looks like a powerful and flexible productivity app but i find the help and support information across platforms somewhat overwhelming and confusing i think that for the easily confused it would benefit from a good tidy up beginning with a clear conceptual overview of the design philosophy and architecture of the product and the methodology of its use including flow diagrams and examples before any specific platform advice
__label__3 the app its good and all but i cant do anything without the app telling me i cant do it cuz i got to pay to do it and its very anoying for that i go to an app that is called ourhome that is completely free and has all the features ok the any do premium for free so check that
__label__3 unnecessarily complex a simple one dimensional version would be fine
__label__3 helpful
"__label__3 loved the app but at some point it stopped letting me look at my tasks 
without instantly crashing so i'm not using it anymore i'll be sure to try 
it again and recommend it to friends if the issue isn't present next time"
__label__3 does not update tasks in widget automatically
__label__3 used it twice so far so good
__label__4 would love to be able to customize the app more need to add a dark theme and also add an agenda view
__label__3 after the recent update displays alarms an hour earlier than they actually are been using the app for more than a year now and love it
__label__4 i wish i could give it 5 stars only thing missing is a windows linux app for syncing which i can't do without and that's the only thing keeping me away i would happily pay for that feature if you just need an android app no need to look elsewhere it has everything you can ask for the ui is great and very intuitive
__label__3 great app but unless you pay 48 year you can't type comments against your tasks
__label__5 i love this app it's so colourful and easy to use
__label__3 please allow ability to scroll to see all the tasks other than that i like the main features and the shopping list
__label__1 the 'free trail' took my money up front do not install so angry
__label__5 this is a very cool app perfect although it should have more link options for other apps as well
__label__1 some time it's automatic stopped and not work properly
__label__2 the widget doesn't auto update after i add an event always need to click the manual refresh button same goes for when i delete an event
__label__5 提醒方式可設定成全螢幕鬧鐘模式 不會錯過
__label__1 bad avoid
__label__3 we need an option to send and link a task with other people i e sending it to them via email this then should automatically update on your account when the other person makes changed to that specific task
__label__3 haven't used it a lot yet but enjoying the simple way to add tasks
__label__2 can't change font sizes old guy and even with premium trial can not change recurring task to monthly day of month from monthly day of week or i should say you can make the change but next time viewing task it shows repeat every third monday of the month rather than every month on the 20th also i don't see a way to force sync account if that matters
__label__5 well thought out app for taking and tracking tasks i love the way it can set up recurring tasks for various time periods the comment taking works well as does uploading attachments good device support and notifications this one's a keeper
__label__2 an option for daily jobs to carry over is necessary having to re add tasks is stupid
"__label__3 idk wht hppen but every time i open the app it stated tht the app hs been 
blocked by system idk y btw im using oppo f1s"
__label__4 i'm enjoying the user interface it's has a nice aesthetic and more importantly has pretty much everything i need for putting down my tasks however the widget keeps freezing on my home page and my completed tasks for a particular day don't show up in the app for that day
__label__1 why are you counting inactive habits for the 5 habits total it's ridiculous there are many other apps that don't have this silly cash grabbing limit
__label__3 its okay for a plan in a phone
__label__3 need to pay to track more than 5 habits and ui doesn't look simple or impressive
__label__1 how it should work is fantastic and perfect for me but whenever i have my schedule laid out and planned the app deletes them or forgets them and i have to start over only to have them deleted again i really really want to use it why does it make it so unable to
__label__5 very easy to use does the job well has all the fields i need and links to maps alarms searches
__label__1 always missing the notifications even when it is not optimized and restricted in background
__label__1 i click undo but retain the xp no real theme or this app very bland needs character
__label__5 very good no ads are seen using from 3 days
__label__3 nice but am looking for something that can synchronize with google tasks
__label__4 fabulous tool for task management by those organizationally challenged for five stars it would need to include a calendar function
__label__2 can't adjust center clock size can't open alarms by touching the center clock the image for opening the app on the play store doesn't represent what you can customize the clock to look like as a widget augh cool but lacking necessary functions edit i was not able to click the center clock and open my alarms not sure why but the developer said it is possible
__label__3 like the concept but was hoping to see the full widget on my phone unfortunately does not display like the screenshot you show above on a samsung s7 edge not sure if it is settings i need to change i would also like better integration with microsoft outlook currently it takes me to the calendar but none of my meetings show up on the widget integrates well to samsung planner and google calendar but not my work app calendar finally like some of the ideas below of changing to a 24h calendar
__label__2 two stars bc i have adhd and i really wanted it to work it isn't user friendly and i can't give it the time of day to sit and figure it out i'll try again later maybe this fall
__label__4 thank you i love the app and it's helping me immensely already the only suggestion i can think of is i wish there was a way of keeping track of my previously completed tasks so i could look back on the progress i've made it would feel much more meaningful that way and serve as additional motivation
__label__5 love this a simple easy way to keep me on track during the day
__label__2 i really enjoy this app but it has just stopped working randomly i tried to hatch a dragon egg and the app crashed and since then i cant access it i have tried uninstalling the app but nothing is working i have even tried to use the website but it doesnt keep track of my exp gained i am very dissapointed as i really like the idea of the app
__label__3 i really like the app but i would enjoy it more if there was the ability to manually order tasks through simple drag and drop like in liferpg also if there was a quicker way to edit like in life rpg that would be great i would be willing to pay as a way of supporting you guys but right now liferpg is more practical and they'll get my money until you catch up love the decreasing skills btw
__label__3 i really wanted to like this app but location based services doesn't work im giving this 3 stars still because technical support was very responsive and is giving me a full refund
__label__1 bekar app at all
__label__4 could you allow me to add activities on my timeline because my routine and plan is always changing and cannot be limited to a fixed routine i use this as a daily planner to plan out my full days and weeks ahead of time so it would be good if i can add activities far ahead of time
__label__4 i just downloaded it to see the continuity of work i do i found it personally useful 1st i am reminded by the large display of tracking down my habit which i wanted to continue 2nd now i can read the comments i entered after finishing the tasks now it is becoming habit for me to keep track on my habits that i see improvement in overall doing i hope i still achieve lot more through this app i heartly thank to the developers and creators of this app signing off
__label__3 when you start to reschedule things the interface is very awkward moving times around for example moving everything forward or backward on the schedule is very un intuitive
__label__3 this app is actually wonderful i'm hoping you can add the forward and backward buttons on the widget potentially just as another available function of those virtual buttons like we have access to in the full app it would be nice to click forward through the calendar and then say click the clock center to refresh and reload with the current time
__label__5 i can see my day at a glance with out screen beign cluttered
__label__3 fix the glitch where if you want to change the streak of a daily the keyboard pops up and gos down super annoying
__label__3 its a to do list that can go everywhere with you and no writing can prioritize list as well great little app 11 2019 edit hoping like other folks that they undo the changes this app has gotten more difficult and counterintuitive with the last update used to be able to select multiple items to reschedule at one time can't do that anymore also used to be able to just type repeat everyday repeat every monday wednesday and friday etc it now seems like only sometimes that works
__label__3 finally is working but i had to erase the data on my cellphone later i'm going to check what happened with the avatar until then the rating gonna stay still
__label__5 this app has been helping me maintain as in all of my classes i have adhd so i find it hard to stay focused but this app has been a lifesaver i hope to see more achievements added in the future thank you forest team for making an app that actually helps people on a daily basis you guys rock
__label__4 great help when you need to stay focused and shouldn't touch your phone since the last update i can't access the shop anymore it keeps loading and loading
__label__5 nice app if you have tons of calendars from different accounts and still want to be able to see a selected subset of them a bit annoying with the pro version advertisement as of recently please let add a feature to remove the tasks panel i don't use it and can't resize it it takes 1 3 of the day view
__label__1 hard to understand setup could not schedule tasks to weekdays does not even show a calendar
__label__3 the only thing not working is the reminder i'm using huawei mate8 can somebody help me how
__label__3 i would gladly pay 5 for the premium features of this up but they want a monthly subscription i don't think that's a fair price at all but it's a good app with the free features so 3 stars
__label__4 nice app but haven't been able to explore it's full potential
__label__5 this is a very convenient little app that can have quite a big and positive impact on your daily routine especially if you work on a lot of different projects for me the indicated time between events is very helpul in planning breaks must have for anyone who is looking for a clean and effective way to manage their schedule well worth the purchase
__label__2 i love the ideia but the executation is not good i want to put reminders for every day and know what i need to do in a clock like that this app needs his own callendar and clock for we customize without messing up anything on the original apps in the phone this need a every day reminder routine and stuff
__label__4 this app is great closest i've found to what i want but i wish there was an option to add goals instead of just habits and give the goals a bit more options for their completion and reminders sure i want to have the habit of eating healthy lunches but i also want to record my goal of losing a certain amount of weight over a few months
__label__2 looks great but not useful in free plan and it's very expensive
__label__3 cute but seems like it would benefit from a way to set eg monthly or annual reminders for bills and birthdays without going to a google script
__label__1 extremely disappointed i had been a faithful user of this app and loved it then all of sudden everything changed there is no cloud support the tabs option is gone there is no interface with established tasks list i have tried and tried to use i contacted support and they replied that due to streamlining the app it has a completely new appearance i had uninstalled this app however i felt i needed to write thos review after i finish this uninstalling this app useless to me
__label__1 terrible app
__label__2 you can't set a location by name only address yes i tried setting my location manually like that would be at all useful do you even understand what i'm saying i cant type in la fitness and get an address it will just send me to whichever is closest setting my location wouldn't help it would just send me to the closest one to my manual instead of one that may be further worthless
__label__4 app services are very best but its very expensive when i tap for subscribe yearly subscription google say your limit cross
__label__5 good
__label__1 the link provided is the same robot answer i received by email i still cannot download the the pro version i bought as it was removed from the market if you remove it from the market then obvisouly no one can download it and if it is not removed provide the download link else do not tell your customers that it is a perpetual license did you ever hear about short links
__label__3 overall app is great but the worst part is changes are not synced between android and ios devices that's really annoying and causes issues if you rely on todo but if you cannot rely this app doesn't make any sense
__label__2 could have been a good free app nice design good ideas but the free version keeps forgetting the task alarm i configured i put it at 6 but it resets it at 9 don't know about the paid one
__label__3 best app to mannage your time
__label__4 i couldn't find any other app that allows for routines with cool schedules and calendar features i love how it tells me how much time i have left in the day the when the day start setting confuses me though
__label__5 surp
__label__3 don't know why but weather shown is for 750 miles away for a region i've never been and can't find a way to adjust it also can't use google tasks not as useful as i'd hoped
__label__3 decent but wunderlist seemed easier to use and felt more intuitive also find that i have to sync manually in this app for others to see my updates that's a pain
__label__4 have been looking for a way to incorporate the elements of gaming into making progress in real life even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic really like it and it has made a big difference the only reason i took it down a star is because it depletes my phone battery really fast if i am in the app for very long such as when i am shopping or browsing challenges so i do these things mostly on my pc overall great job would recommend this to anyone that enjoys gaming but is struggling with motivation in the real world
__label__5 absolutely fantastic clean fast non intrusive
__label__3 need to increase some options of task editing
__label__5 i have never come across an app like this before everything felt so thought out this definitely helped me organize my work a lot
__label__3 i just dont do subscriptions if it was one time pay i would actually try it as it is i simply uninstalled it no thank you
__label__3 a decent app but for me it's not worth paying 15 yr for and that's at 50 off 30 is just ridiculous for a to do calender app there are other task calender apps just as good and free
__label__1 no longer syncs no longer supported so no longer installed on my phone was a good app shame
__label__5 exceptional works perfectly
__label__1 this is a pay to play calendar only
__label__5 the planner pro is very helpful and works as it mentioned addition of a black background will makes the app more attractive other issue i encountered is when ever set a passcode the app log out automatically showing a dialouge box that your password has been changed and when i try to log in using password on next screen it prompt for passcode and the app don't open with correct passcode so now i set passcode and password same so now the app works fine
__label__3 excellent concept which has huge potential only problem is that the hour hand does not keep time correctly in 24 hour time it shows 1400 instead of 1600 2 hour difference
__label__2 lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget i use todoist for homework assignments and i used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for without being able to see all my parent sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app i went back to an old apk but then i started getting prompts that the app would stop working if i didn't update i still use it as a grocery list with ifttt until keep is fixed
__label__3 it does the job
__label__4 great app i wish it had two features the ability to add directly to a folder without having to move it and the ability to resize the widget to a smaller height
__label__2 very nice
__label__3 every time i click the plant button it don't works and i have to try it many times and the tree is planted
__label__5 i have come to absolutely love this app i have used it's beautiful widget playform on my last two or three devices for years it is such an easy and awesome way for me to bring all my calendar scheduling together there was an initial learning curve to it at the start but once i got the hang of it it became so quick and easy amazing app guys glad i bought it
__label__4 muy buena app estoy apunto de comprar la versión plus de lo buena qué es
__label__1 it's a good app but there should be downloadble templates since it would take time and a lot harder to create your own design
__label__3 it was really great until i bought my samsung s9 was using an s6 prior and when i transferred the business calendar program to the s9 the calendar's search function no longer worked i ask you how useful is a business cakendar without a search function
__label__3 the best android calendar app for power users however since a year or so it freezes with almost every use making it practically impossible to use not sure if this is a widespread problem or just me support has been responsive and has tried to reproduce the problem but in vain the option of sending a logfile for analysis is unfortunately not available a pity as it is a great app i still haven't found any other remotely as good as this one
__label__4 i really love this app it has really nice plants and gives you rewards too the only thing that i don't like is that now when you exit the forest app it doesn't force you to come back last year in 2019 i experienced that when i exited the app it would force me to come back pls fix this
__label__2 subscription required just to set a reminder
__label__3 it has almost everything that i need but the thing that frustrates me the most is the calendar view that's really the most important thing to see how many days you've tracked in a row switch to calendar view it looks just like a regular calendar and nothing is highlighted for anything you have to click on each individual day to see what it looks like
__label__4 very good app for focus has helped me on more than one occasion i will say though the audio it plays if you choose to play it sometimes glitches out on my galaxy s9 it will sometimes just shut off and refuse to play even when my volume is on and the sound option is on otherwise though its a very good focus app great for people like me who get easily distracted by their phones
__label__1 i have paid for the premium features but the sync is not working i mailed them but got no response
__label__3 a blue flag
__label__2 i couldn't get past the set up 'strength is not valid enum value path 'attitude'
__label__1 not reminding this app cannot user friendly
__label__3 the tasks may go missing
__label__3 it consumes too much 1 3 of the battery otherwise it is great
__label__3 the problem is the phone is not ringing even though ring is turned on output is given alarm volume yet its not ringing
__label__4 straightforward solution for business and personal use in my cell and laptop sometimes i get a bit lost on how to get from granular details back to an overview of projects
__label__2 this app is not free for even a trial so how am i going to buy it
__label__1 if you want to use dark mode you'll have to but premium i understand the need to make money off your app but thats just scummy
__label__3 1 apart from events how to import reminders from google calendar app 2 how to import the tasks from google tasks app
__label__4 works great at keeping me organized i have not had it long so i will have to explore the features update new phone i can now use the microphone to add tasks this app is just smart enough i use it as my own personal to do list separate from google tasks which i use for work it's simple with just enough features and not all the predictive noise threaded through all google apps
__label__4 this is the best app i have ever used to keep track of my activities the greatest part is that each time you feel like giving up to achieving your objectives it will always remind you which is very motivating i only have one problem though having trouble with syncronising my progress which means if the app was to be accidentally uninstalled and then reinstalled again then all the progress i had saved would be lost so this one reason i give you a 4 star rating instead of a 5 good app though
__label__1 can't contact support software erases or moves things without my wanting this no instructions no labels on controls it is more frustration than anything
__label__5 perfect a calendar with the opportunity to create notes for everyday or other notes on the side i just love it
__label__4 excellent app great habit tracker i've found in this app an exciting way to be productive there are some bugs and functionalities that need to be fixed however it's worth using it i really recommend it
__label__4 great app i love the subtasks option
__label__3 i want dark mode without payin like the light mode is too light
__label__3 govind
__label__4 things were going great until i switched to a new phone i can't find out how to sync my tasks and events to the new phone i installed the app in my new phone and logged in but the data is not there i see that the events comes from the google calendar and i may be able to do something about that but how do i sync the tasks pls help
__label__1 demands premium account for serving the most basic features
__label__4 easy to use a direct link with other apps google calendar outlook calendar would be a great add on
__label__4 pros it's fun lots of customisation all basic functionality are free inclined to habit generation than everyday to do list cons first time setup are quite challenging literally create your own system icons themes are limited minor inconvenience i was using liferpg which seems abandoned now so it helps with the learning curve i see devs made lots improvement here recommended
__label__1 when it works it's great but after using it for a while and paying for the ability to export and sync data all my data is gone every attempt to contact them goes unanswered and the last update was over a year ago they're willing to take your money but not to update or support the software use this at your own risk
__label__2 i really love this but when i want to use it for second time this apps crashed i've uninstalled for many times but it still the same please do something
__label__5 this app has helped me a lot and is all in all one of the best apps i know there's just one suggestion i have many habits and dailies hence i have to scroll a lot it would be amazing if there was an option to change the layout so you can have a better overview
__label__1 i loved this app but until they get rid of the yearly charge after making us buy it to begin with i'll keep this at a 1 i did previously have this as 5 star but i can't stand companies doing stuff like this
__label__5 easy to install very similar to wunderlist but much easier was a wunderlist user for over 5 years loved the app kept my finances on straight and narrow thank you for do this amazing list did not like the new microsoft office task list far to difficult to get let alone use i don't have time to fiddle around on phone and this takes me straight to my lists i also used wunderlist for shopping planning events loads i am looking forward to using this app
__label__5 it's very good apps
__label__2 not a great user interface have been using for almost 2 months but still struggling
__label__2 correct idea worng execution the watch face ui cannont be operated like manually moving clock hands the time zone stick moves at an interval of 1hr i wanted to set it at any choosen time and add reminder from there big flop was it did not read my calender event and yes i did give necessary permission phone one plus 7 os build oxygen os 9 5 5 gm57aa further action uninstalling outlook would like to try it post improvement
__label__2 this would be great if it didn't require me to mark negatives in other words it requires me to mark everyday i did not do something such as smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol this is overly cumbersome over time and is going to cause me to stop using the app because i don't want to have to check everything that didn't happen this could be much better if it assumes i didn't drink or smoke if i didn't make any mark for that day or at least give me the option to do it this way
__label__2 free version gives only 5 habits there are far clearer and better trackers available for free
__label__3 edited review
__label__5 i love the app i am a big procrastinater and this makes me so much more organized it tells me when to move on and doesn't waste my time thank you
__label__3 beautiful idea bad design
__label__1 very nice app could be very useful but unfortunately does not sync
__label__3 great but missing exchange tasks on widget please add
__label__5 very well polished minimalist
__label__3 felt very complicated when i am flying high
__label__2 had been very good but now any reminder that is not completed by the end of the day gets marked as complete inatead of showing up as overdue on repeating tasks sometimes marking today's as done will also mark 1 2 or even 3 days into the future as done with no pattern behind the glitch has become very cumbersome to use and has resulted in many tasks getting missed
__label__4 this app works for me this app is able to be customize i don't fit the box for most general apps i do wish that social piece wasnt there where you have the ability to what other are people have listed as their habit to break i think there may be trolls getting kicks to see their obsurd habits stay at the top of this list on a positive note you can hide this
__label__2 have been a user for years but the app is borderline unusable at this point it's not saving anything and is not connecting to servers tried uninstalling and reinstalling not sure what's wrong
__label__5 i didn't think this app was much at first but i soon started to get into the swing of things i've been trying to get myself into for the longest time after installing there's just something about that feeling of satisfaction when you fill in a circle for completing something it tracks your streaks and your average progress it also encourages you with cute quotes about being yourself and being the best you forming or breaking a habit can be done easily with habit bull
__label__3 good
"__label__3 it's a great concept though i uninstalled it it feels too playful and the 
graphics and interface attract too much of my attention i would have kept 
it if were simpler more plain less 16 bit in fact i'd rather not have 
the avatar if it did a better job at making me feel like the tasks i 
complete are meaningful purposeful tangible not like i'm doing them 
because i'm some silly video game character and i want more shiny pixels 
the tasks i would have listed on the app are real life tasks with real life 
consequences in summary i was hoping it'd bring a sense of game to my 
life not make me feel like my life is an inconsequential game"
__label__3 clunky inflexible but does the job
__label__5 this app is great for everyday planning to plan shopping or fast task equally good for planning big projects keeping on track with your habits and stay focused with pomo fast powerful lite
__label__4 long time user of this app problem is it doesn't have a search feature or if it does i can't find it sometimes i forget where i filed my note or task again longtime user and then it takes me a while to go through all my files to figure out which title heading i put it under but if it had a search feature i could quickly find it and get back to being productive for this reason i gave it 4 stars because it has room for improvement
__label__1 alarm nahi he
__label__2 it does not ync eith al the calendars
__label__3 this deserves 5 stars but i am not able to see discussions since the last one week
__label__1 notifications and reminders doesnt work
__label__2 i don't care for it when i first opened it it showed me all these appointments i was thinking what the heck then i figured out it was showing me weeks passed along with the current to me that's just a bunch of clutter then it was telling me i had five appointments this month no only have one it only showed the one but it still says 5 i don't have a clue what the other four are anytime i try to do anyting it practically begged me to join premium i just uninstalled it
__label__4 i have no problems with the app so it must be working
__label__4 cool keeping track of my stuffs is very good
__label__2 while changing list by scrolling right to left task get deleted it's very confusing
__label__4 good
__label__1 completed tasks continue to reappear
__label__4 just started but it seems easy to pick up
__label__5 on the one hand it takes a while to customize and set up but that's because there are a lot of options for customization available which i love this is helpful motivating me to accomplish my tasks
__label__4 sure could use a completed tasks tab i hide my completed tasks in tabs as it just gets messy and when i wanna check what is done i gotta manually untick the hide completed and then tick it again i'd also appreciate if you could see when the task was completed overall a great multiplatform tool been using it since i found it
__label__5 amazing it really helps to focus on important tasks rather than wasting time on useless apps a huge plus in my opinion is the fact that when you upgrade to pro you can plant real trees only using coins you've collected in the game
__label__2 c'mon to have more than 10 lists i've to pay nope that's not gonna happen
__label__3 it has a nice pop up widget for your to do list the problem with this app is when i want it to alert me always at 9 about it or remind me of my tasks it doesn't its just there i'm still using it but i feel google assistant does a better job of reminding me so i might delete it later not so satisfying
__label__5 the perfect marriage of pen pixel if you love the features and visuals of a paper planner but stink at keeping up with it this is for you it allows me to sync to my google calendars color code switch an event from one google calendar to another which even google calendar won't let me do look at my schedule as a single day week or month without having to put items in 3 different places set and write down goals track water meal plan make lists check off tasks
__label__3 the app is pretty good but i wish there was a way to put weekly tasks in i tried setting up a task that would go off weekly but i still lost health for not completing it daily it would be nice to be able to put repeating tasks on the app that you don't do every day but repeat on a schedule like laundry every sunday or something
__label__4 this application is very useful in helping keep me organized and paced the only suggestion i'd make is on the interface when checking off my tasks for the day the add new task button is in the way of pressing the cross off button it's a bit annoying but i love this app
__label__1 the app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list rpg but there's a subscription you have to pay for literally completely ruins the purpose of the app
__label__4 in general this app helps me keep track of my habits which is great however the app has quite a few bugs even after buying the premium version which is disappointing the sync function doesn't work at all and i don't see any effort to fix these issues this is one of the rare apps where i won't be giving a 5 star review
__label__3 no white space between tasks no line between tasks checkboxes are in the middle of an item one big block of text instead of neat list of tasks just impossible to see where each task starts
__label__2 correct idea worng execution the watch face ui cannont be operated like manually moving clock hands the time zone stick moves at an interval of 1hr i wanted to set it at any choosen time and add reminder from there big flop was it did not read my calender event and yes i did give necessary permission phone one plus 7 os build oxygen os 9 5 5 gm57aa further action uninstalling outlook would like to try it post improvement
__label__4 good visual representation of my daily schedule and to do list a great way to remain mindful of how time is spent during the day
__label__4 its really useful i really wish it had a way to add people so you could submit tasks for eachother or a way to access it on a computer or browser
__label__3 i downloaded s graph but i do not have any widgets with it i have google calendar i can open the app but there is no home screen widget any way i can fix that i have a samsung s6 active thanks a lot
__label__2 like the look but it messes up straight away instead of saving an entry the app cashed and deleted it instead don't get
__label__4 good
__label__2 not backup in device offline
__label__5 pretty good a little buggy with data for example i have more then 0 postive adds to eating 1 fuit and vegi also there should be a cap to tapping like a cap people can set or an option so that acidental tapping dossent happen other then this its a great app
__label__5 i bought paid version it works perfectly for me serves the purpose now i am able to manage my daily tasks with efficiency
__label__2 good until it started wanting money for doing its job
__label__4 cool
__label__2 i can't cancel my subscription how can i do that
__label__4 perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist it has profound customization ability the reward system is more complex than competitors for someone with significant attention issues this has really helped me to feel invested subtasks and autofails are great features would be 5 stars if developers 1 allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2 made tutorial videos full functionality will be a learning curve for many
__label__2 when i share my task on whatsapp even though i selected share title and content it only shares title version 5 2 2 if i share my task in the form of image the task with long name the end of the name gets replaced with instead of showing the remaining heading on new line
__label__1 w
__label__3 i used to have 5 stars but then the layout changed and i find it incredibly difficult to organise i'll go so far as saying i hate it it's just soo much i want to have a separate view for each day not an endless scroll like some facebook timeline
__label__5 excellent very versatile i like being able to set multiple reminders and the location
__label__3 great but when you set a target date it doesnt remain as is and shifts to another day for that month
__label__4 have re defined my routines and activities working well
__label__4 keeps me on track
__label__3 this app is a great idea and i love all the features however no matter what i set the day start time to for daily tasks to reset they keep resetting at some seemingly random point in the middle of the day despite me having it at 2am which is causing all of my evening tasks and some of my midday tasks to fail as i haven't done them yet i'm not sure if the app thinks i'm in a different time zone or what but it's very irritating if they fix that it's 5 stars for sure
__label__4 very good if a little hard to navigate would recommend
__label__3
__label__2 wunderlist
__label__3 easy to use
__label__2 for some weird reason the app timer stopped working after a few months of installing the app i used to use it everyday but now all i can do is uninstall it it's kinda weird how this is an editors choice app i would give this a five star if this was fixed and it would be much better if this was not a timer i would much more prefer if you can add a start button and when you finished studying you can just stop it instead you can't really estimate the time it takes for you to study
__label__3 best task app out there i always come back after testing newer ones but the new notifications are terrible they turn my screen on at random times don't follow material design i already have the quick add notification why are they a separate section
__label__5 i love this app
__label__1 over basic definitely not worth 200 per year pictures shown are not what the app looks like
__label__3 sync with google tasks totally broken tasks are months out of date
__label__3 zokay
__label__3 i like the app so far one issue is like someone else said why do you have to pay for the app before doing a free 14 day trial second why don't the notifications pop up where i can see them that was one of the main reasons that i got the app i need to be constantly reminded of what i need to do i have adhd and remembering a bunch of things that i have to do is a huge issue
__label__3 i love the idea of it but i am having a hard time trying to get started as i am setting up my dailies anything that i set for weekly seemed like they are all linked together so if i change my days on one task it changes on something else i like what it trying to do but if this isn't corrected then i will have to find another app
__label__2 reminder requires payment
__label__4 awesome new idea for a productivity widget significantly more useful than a calendar or list of upcoming events the one thing i would like to change would be the display of numbers on arcs it looks kind of silly near the center of the circle when the numbers twist and overlap change that 5 stars
__label__3 it is good but not for me
__label__5 i love this app it is flexible intuitive attractive and has features i have been looking for and have been unable to find in the other task list apps i have tried
__label__3 really great app great interface easy to input tasks but you can't have your tasks show on google calendar which is pretty disappointing
__label__1 can't set the username field
__label__4 easy transition from wunderlist and it covers the vast majority of functionality
__label__1 i couldn't even log in
__label__5 great support ads were displayed dev had it fixed in a day thank you and great product it's the closest thing to a franklin planner i have found
__label__5 brilliant and incredible app it turns my daily life into enjoyable one with simple rpg concept love it
__label__5 good
__label__2 wish i could sync it across multiple devices
__label__3 it don't work with samsung gear s3 smart watch even after i bought tge widget
__label__3 good
__label__3 i am examining the possibility of transferring from the excellent wunderlist app to this microsoft to do it has been a challenge so far question how do i connect microsoft to do with google and samsung calendars just as we did with wunderlist thanks
__label__2 i actually really like this app but one of the biggest features that needs to work properly for my routines is repeating reminders i set reminds for monthly bills such as rent and set it to repeat monthly but when i complete the task it uncompletes itself the very next day without setting the reminder to the next month basically if i set it to november 1st it tries to remind me again daily on november 1st it doesn't work i love the app but the most important feature is broken sadly
__label__3 i allowed it to do everything possible and it didn't tell me to give in my email so now i can't play the game because an email wasn't sent to me
__label__3 would love the calender to automatically fill in details of invitations and interested or going to an event
__label__2 you can't have your to do list as notifications
__label__1 too complicated trying to add items to a list it keeps trying to use the item names instead to make a new list or send the old list to this
__label__1 was good but has recently been persistently bugging me for add'l permissions including to my google account uninstalled it
__label__3 sync between gcal was so bad that i wasted plenty of time waiting to add a single task for almost half a year it worked fairly nice but that problems with sync today was enough to lose any trust for keeping important task on that platform
__label__1 ive tried this app 2 times its great but everytime i use it it installs pop up adds all over my phone as soon as i go to open one app their is an add not cool i deleted it for the 3 and final time
__label__3 i would love to buy trees but even though i have the coins i get told i don't have enough that is rather frustrating but it is great to set goals and make it so you can not be distracted by texts and emails
__label__5 this app helps me stay organized with my online work during quarantine it reminds of assignments that are overdue and lets me set priorities for each assignments really helpful app if you're a procrastinator like i am
__label__2 please give us a way of disabling the red notification dot it serves no purpose if i can't tell what it's for get rid of it or make it more clear what it's indicating ux should never be an afterthought
__label__3 planner isnt saving all day events you can see an event is there in month view but when you open that day the event does not show
__label__3 this is a good planner because it's easy to use and understand but the widget consumes a lot of the phone's battery
__label__1 over complicated
__label__1 hyper masculine tone is very off putting and irritating hint to developers women try to change habits too at least give us the option of just having hints in our own words
__label__5 this should be the highest rated app its simply amazing and doing chores is much more fun
__label__3 i purchased the pro version inside this app why can't i download the pro app in google store
__label__4 very good sometimes aggressive advertisement
__label__4 its your calendar on a clock best if you have a smart watch i dont but still a great app if your a visual person 5 star if i ever get a smart watch
__label__1 won't let me customize my avatar except for glasses
__label__1 the customization screen at the beginning of set up doesn't work tasks have tagging section with no clear way to actually add tags to it
__label__5 great to do app that does everything you want also syncs perfectly with planner for elementary os
__label__5 simple and neat
__label__4 good replacement for wunderlist missing the possibility to create to do by sending email
__label__2 please get rid of all the white space i have to scroll to read my lists give us an option to zoom out or reskin this app to look like wunderlist thanks
__label__3 i wish the clock looked simpler the point of downloading the app was to be able to see what my day is like just by looking at it once the sectors should be more defined
__label__2 guys you created a great app that i'd been using for years but the latest update is weird modal views when selecting a single task why do i need it instead of previous submenu for rescheduling no ability to choose multiple tasks only by top menu select tasks strange icons that all makes me really sad rolled out to the previous friendly todoist
__label__5 it's my most favourite app thanks for creating such an amazing app
__label__2 very easy to pull me in i should have stopped but hindsight is always 20 20 my friends and people who are interested in google apps for integrated coordination of tasks meetings whatever but what really gets my blood boiling and made me downgraded from 3 stars to 2 stars is the deadweight loss of not being able to either donate the rest of the subscription source capital investment that is just raining still if someone makes to make a donation is that i'm still sitting here with this deadweight loss
__label__4 love it so helpful works really well and is super cute i just wish the different trees cost less coins
__label__4 its great app it should be complete free but of course nor maybe few updates than i'll rate 5
__label__3 just downloaded seems to be a simple task to do list that i was looking for question how do i get the app to be an onscreen widget which is shown on the screen shots above thank you
__label__2 heres the thing i love this app and the idea behind it but for some reason its so dang glitchy pages wont always change when i scroll tasks dont refresh i often have to completely close the app help very willing to change this review to 5 stars if we get this figured out
__label__5 great
__label__5 clean interface i liked the minimalistic design without much clutter but have a question for team i have added hundreds of tasks in a list now i want to edit a particular task i could not figure out how to search that task it is difficult to go through huge list
__label__5 exactly what i was looking for a way to set up and visualize my weekly routine
__label__5 good app
__label__2 nowhere near as good as wunderlist which i've been using for several years gutted that microsoft are stopping wunderlist in favour of this very poor substitute not feeling the love for microsoft anymore
__label__1 requires creating an online account to view the calendar therefore there is no reason to use this over google calendar
__label__1 too complicated and time consuming to set a task no way to repeat on a monthly basis and specific day of the week at the same time not worth the time it takes to use it uninstalling
__label__3 good but very confusing it was good if i knew how to use it the whole set up was very confusing and hard to understand i really hope in the future it becomes simpler
__label__2 it doesn't sync up with google tasks not worth the change zapier does not work for android zapier only works if you pay the premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with google tasks it does not import current tasks previously created in google tasks there is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from google to anydo and i can't afford 72 00 right off the bat to do it
__label__1 absolute rubbish killing off wunderlist for this is a clear example of the domanant power of the big thugs microsoft google amazon etc taking over better competitors so they can push their inferior garbage trying out ticktock now
__label__5 this app is awesome at the moment while we're in quarantine i have to do a whole bunch of school work and it's just easier for me to make sure i'm doing everything make sure i'm getting everything done and it's just really great thank you so much
__label__4 nice app would like further customization for habits such as perhaps scores the better you tackle a habit healthier eating today than yesterday resulting in a higher score this would make the app much more useful for me otherwise great app
__label__3 i really like any do and having my to do list and events in the same place however i have knocked off stars because i need more customisable repeat options and notifications sometimes my tasks are every two weeks or every other day or every 3 days would be nice for this option i also like to put reminders in for my work calendar i don't seem to get the option to change this when doing a new event reminder can't afford premium shame back to google calendar
__label__2 as someone who isn't interested in task sharing or syncing i find it insulting todoist locks some otherwise basic features like reminder notifications behind a subscription instead of a one time unlock that's just greedy
__label__1 please fixed it why i can't login my passcode damnly alot of doc i ve save inside
__label__4 really good at what it does but i've asked for support for what seem to be glitches transferring data between devices twice and gotten nothing back that's frustrating
__label__2 it's okay but i migrated from wunderlist and i still miss it plus the widget keeps on breaking not showing any tasks when i delete it and put it back on the screen it works again but only for a few days please fix this
__label__3 est ce que vous avez une version de business calendar pour les laptop
__label__3 please help the app keeps crashing after some automatic update it refuses to open after the crash have to reinstall it everytime until it crashes again have done this the 6th time being a pro user i get to sign in and retrieve the data but still loses lot of time and momentum doing all this installing and reinstalling thing after each crash btw amazing app helped me focus and have goals in life
__label__3 looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to i would reconsider if the paywall wasn't a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase
__label__5 best to do app
__label__1 couldn't figure out
__label__5 overall fine search option only on main screen pl give it inside task list user list also also data export option
__label__1 reminder works but i scroll down from top i see the correct items bc not google if i open i see some old reminders sometimes they update mostly not pls solve the problem once and for all it must have something to do with cache in the app itself not a google calendar issue btw bad support on mail no or useless response
__label__2 lots of in app purchases not worth the time
__label__2 it's motivating but pro mode is a disappointment now rather than being able to watch an ad for double coins at the end of a session i earn the same base coins with the option to pay real money for increased coin earning i already paid for pro mode and pro mode feels entirely necessary for the white listing feature without it even apps like a music player or calculator that are sometimes required to be used while you are focusing will kill your tree i feel ripped off
__label__4 the only bad point is i can't tick the sub task box on the widget and this is quite disappointing
__label__4 very good just one point when listing coming up tasks it would be good to have bands of background semi transparent color to highlight today's events and next 3 days events for example to be distinguished from far future events all in one list with no distinction tends to be overlooked
__label__2 it is so stupid that i have to be coneccted to my calender and cant just create what i want to much work not worth it
__label__1 there are glitches in the android app that aren't in the web app i love the web app would give this 5 stars if todoist fixed them and introduce a bug reporting feature so that bugs like these don't remain unfixed dragging subtasks is often glitchy and doesn't parent under the correct parent task or just reorders back to original placement after i drag it to a parent task the and symbol rarely actually pops up with label auto recognition as i type like it does on the web app
__label__3 unable to set custom notification sound it uses default sound even after changing others looks good
__label__3 it's really a great app and good concept to cure phone addiction but i've some ideas for making it more interesting introduce forest customization options like a real forest add animals cascades etc anyway great work guys
__label__3 frequent crashes
__label__5 easy to use and easy to keep organized
__label__3 this is a good app but the data analysis and visualization is fundamentally broken the score and success percentage function in that they record the success values for the end of each day and then add that to the database this means unfortunately that your success percentage never goes above your first day when if you did the thing you got 100 as such the visualizations are useless a better solution would be to include rolling means of success percentage by x number of day intervals
__label__1 no reply to my ticktick premium cancellation mail since 2 days new update another day has passed and no reply to mail has been received yet
__label__3 happily used for years unfortunately my events have been disappearing lately for no reason so i will be uninstalling
__label__2 once installed the app was showing another time zone
__label__5 really nice app sir could you please provide goal tracking functionality too that'd be very useful too
__label__1 very bad app and not useful
__label__4 please add an option to update habit task status from the notification bar when i receive notification on the set time overall good app
__label__5 cool app to visualize ur schedule and make it easier to plan your day a really cool customization system and integration with some non default calendars is great bought a premium right after first day
__label__3 can only track 5 habits but there are discussion forums most of the forums have no activity going on but there are still a few users to talk to often times the app no longer syncs me to them just like right now the quotes have been stuck too developers no longer support this app do not buy the premium version as you will not be able to sync across devices there are no more updates or customer support this could have been the absolute best habit tracking app so much wasted potential
__label__3 good app a lot of useful features as a premium customer i would like to have the ability to export to an excel or spreadsheet program for reporting purposes also the app freezes a lot on windows
__label__5 love the calendar
__label__3 basically a great task list i would have liked to buy the app but it's subscription a number of comments within feedback about no refunds which i don't take too seriously however makes me nervous
__label__5 it is very useful when you want to track your daily habits i have just started using it it is like a one page map to all the habits that you want to follow use it if you are a person who wants to develop and keep track of habits
__label__2 i quite like habitica but this app has some issues the biggest problem for me is that switching the to do list to scheduled is supposed to sort the to do items by due date that's how it works on the website but it doesn't that makes the to do list in the app useless for me
__label__1 can't even start it properly just says path 'profile name' is required
__label__3 my notifications bar is telling me i have no tasks today even when i know i do which is kind of frustrating plus when i log into the app my tasks aren't in chronological order for some reason after i set times for them at the beginning of the day other than that i think it's a fab app and i love the little pop ups that happen at the beginning of the day and when a task needs to be done
__label__3 would be awesome if paid but free version too restricted it ain't worth it
__label__3 you should have the choice to swipe left and right for different months and just up and down also change the word title event colors on a particular day to make it stand out
__label__5 nicest programm for planning your week
__label__4 for when i keep touching my phone
__label__3 it helps me stay away from my phone for a limit of time and that developed a feeling of productivity in me
__label__3 carry forward of task is amazing strength of the app liked it
__label__5 love it it only thing lacking is just some ideas to motivate me what should i do
__label__3 i love it compared to other apps like it but i do miss the features that epic win has that you can sort your to do s based on the day so you can set up to dos for the future while in habits it all shows in one list instead of being separated by date
__label__5 great app
__label__3 i have noticed when i write notes and leave the app to find out more info the app locks which is fine but what i have written before i leave the app is not saved which can be very annoying there isnt even a warning or option to save before you leave the app
__label__4 i really love timetune in helping me better utilize my time see where it is all going and plan routine tasks so that i can stay on top of my busy life the only thing missing for me is the ability to tick things as completed and cross if not done i'd love to be able to analyze my routine to see what worked well and what i struggled to acheive i find it rewarding and motivating being able to check things off as done
__label__5 this so help me to get focus youu guys much download this app see you guys in department of civil engineering bandung institute of technology i'll be there
__label__1 used it for a fair amount of time without any problems suddenly then asked me to create an account or log using google or fb i used my google one only to discover everything was gone
__label__2 too many functionalities were removed why
__label__2 i bought the premium and i can't sync the data between my devices
__label__5 very useful
__label__3 i like it it's very reorganizing
__label__3 it's ok for now havent really done much with the app yet
__label__4 a little buggy sometimes but all is forgiven for how much this app helps me be a more productive and motivated person i have one request please add some sort of real life stat tracker the idea would be to assign tasks habits or dailies to certain skill categories and you could track points levels or hours for certain skills for example this would be cool for me to keep track of my progress towards mastery as a woodworker or painter etc
__label__3 widget seriously needs fixing screen real estate is important and your widget is huge wastes so much space please set up options for controlling text size in it try to remove dead space the title of the app since it's unnecessary this is almost a deal breaker for me also small request is there any way you can change the task example to anything but the name alex like someone instead because honestly it triggers me pretty bad abuser thanks for considering my comments
__label__5 i don't usually rate apps but i thought i must do for this one i really like its simplicity and practicality it has all the features that i needed it's easy to use ad free and all that is free of charge i mean it's so perfect i really appreciate the hard work behind it thank you for this amazing app
__label__4 despite the unresponsive widget overall a pretty decent app
__label__3 decent app my major problem with it is that i heavily use the app widget from the home screen but the widget is so buggy and it hides all my tasks randomly
__label__5 finally a simple planner that works for me
__label__5 super fun way to build positive life habits
__label__4 very good could have a little more utilities for the free version
__label__4 great app
__label__4 really great app fast and snappy like a to do app should be like so you don't miss any thoughts my biggest issue with this app is that there is no one time pay to buy option for it while i find it useful i don't need a lot of the pro features i am a basic user and need it just to track my personal tasks as such the monthly payment subscription for the pro version does not make sense to me why not add a basic pro model with limited features that users can outright buy forever
__label__3 please make the reminder work it's really important for me to remember things because i forget and don't do it in the end
__label__5 i really love this app i love challenging myself as i have a very bad phone habit and will lose hours staring at my phone devs my trees die when an alarm goes off on my phone super frustrating when i'm just picking it up to turn the alarm off maybe that can be an exception
__label__2 very hard to use cannot get a list of task to do until do date
__label__3 update after about 4years i have grown frustrated with todoist the support team takes around a week to get back to premium members and almost always w a generic thanks for your feedback but i'll say nothing tangible response but 24hrs if you post publicly on twitter priorities seem to be off development has seriously plateaued no significant features in a very long time it seems like they are falling behind in the market
__label__3 i used to love the app until i needed to synchronise to see my tasks to another device then i found out syncing simply won't work and uninstalling reinstalling didn't solve the issue
__label__1 after a week my tasks never showed up completely stopped working
__label__4 app is really great too frequent updates in last week 3 updates
__label__1 those fullscreen ads made me uninstall it after years of using it happily bye won't come back my response or you know i can simply use another calendar app that's free and has no ads
__label__4 i love that the app interface is so easy to use the reason i don't give it 5 stars is because you can't export notes it would be ideal if that could be done
__label__4 love it overall but i had the worst time trying to get it to sync initially i ended up installing the google calendar app in order to get my chromebook to sync on schedule and then bc2 worked just fine must have been the chromebook
__label__2 i like how the app has options to write notes journals for each day it gives you the option to reflect on how you stuck to your habits most other apps don't have this feature that said i'm rating the app two stars because the notifications don't work for me i have set times for reminders throughout the day but the app sends me random notifications reminders when i don't want them and on other days no notifications at all no app updates from the developer in over a year either
__label__3 the app keeps stopping and crashes suddenly i dont unders why
__label__1 only just discovered there's a bit of a sub didn't make that clear before sign up no chance its a cheek doing it sneekly you should be ashamed deleted
__label__3 but of a downgrade from wunderlist please add a button to create a task from the main screen
__label__5 i have used the app for many years and loved it within the last several months it no longer syncs seamlessly with my google calendar specifically organizing tasks has become very gitchy if you are looking for a calendar app and don't mind it not syncing with your google calendar on your desktop then it's a great app unfortunately i'd really like it to sync
__label__5 best app for habits track and tasks i ever used highly recommend easy to use
__label__4 it's the best habit tracker out there but it's not the best it can possibly be after a substantial amount of thought i succumbed and shelled out the 10 euros for the premium version to be able to use the widget which is essential to keep me on track however the widget doesn't respond unless the application is opened beforehand so minus one star for that also a true black widget or user interface would be very nice for amoled screens so fingers crossed for that too
__label__3 taking stars off because no swipe options that's just so bad sorry to see that get back to your previous designs please
__label__5 good app
__label__4 would love to be able to remove tags that already exist or at least edit them i'd like to be able to use different icons and colors for specific named tags that already exist and if i make any mistakes on a new one it's permanent
__label__5 i love this app
__label__5 awesome app allows for custom lists and allows collaboration on ones you specifiy for group projects tasks the interface is clean crisp but also allows you to make it your own by adding color themes to the accents of the task pages the only thing i wish this would include is a customizable smart list based on certain parameters this would make the app even better though out of the box this has everything you need to get your tasks and projects done
__label__2 having issues with syncing with google calendar i added a task on ticktick and it's been over 12 hours and it still has not sync up to my google calendar i've tried refreshing but nothing showed up i've looked at the help forum and many people have the same issue for some time now i just purchased the pro and it's not worth it if it doesn't sync
__label__3 ok ok ok
__label__2 no graph showing shows the task sector on phone app but on watch its just the bare bones time with no events charted
__label__5 really nice and relaxing app i like the relaxing forest noises that play while the tree is growing
__label__1 the alarm doesn't work
__label__1 suddenly not free been using for years now i just had to pay to stay ad free i did not want the extras of pro i just wanted the app i was using to continue to do what it was doing and not show ads should have found a way to disable ads for grandfathered users without access to other features wish i hadn't paid it half asleep i'd find a new app instead
__label__2 i've only just started using it and can already tell it has potential it has a simple ui but very confusing features with next to no instruction on how the features work i purchased the premium version with the hopes to organise my routines to suit my shift work but i can't find a way to automatically alternate my routine cycles if it's even possible starting the following routine cycle when the previous ends
__label__2 i used to really love this app but lately it won't notify me when the timer is up it's hard to keep track of how much you're working
__label__1 too hard to use
__label__3 i wanted to buy the app but the subscription feature turned me down i wish there was a one time purchase option to unlock essential things like calendar unlimited inventory etc and the subscription for themes sounds and other cosmetic stuffs
__label__2 loved this app until it stopped syncing my android app and web app have been out of sync for over 2 weeks
__label__3 the guide to take the notifications off literally just shows for vivo oppo i don't even know what these are huawei and xiaomi phones there's no guide for simply android or iphone
__label__3 pretty good took a while to figure out how to set up a task too many steps screens to set reminder time recurrence etc i feel those should all be on a single screen after saving i can't edit all i get is a prompt screen to sign in or sign up great feature for some but i don't need it it would be nice if that feature was said to be mandatory in the play store listing i wouldn't have wasted my time 3 stars for the forced share and the many stepped interface seems to be feature rich
__label__4 really well for procrastinators and forgetfulness i constantly forget things but this keeps me on track i will admit though that the tags should have an option on sorting them clicking and dragging them to be in a specific order other than that perfect app and no issues so far
__label__1 impossible to use
__label__5 completa y sencilla muy intuitiva me baje 6 app parecidas y las compare elegí ticktick
__label__3 good
__label__2 nice app but i want to unlock the whitelist feature but it's not working please look to it as i want to unlock the whitelist feature for free
__label__3 easy to use but needs better or customizable colors
__label__3 it wouldn't let me delete edit events and had no monthly view on the calendar
__label__4 like it colors change order multiple list completing date
__label__4 very useful very easy to use
__label__3 it's an interesting tool but having one or 2 things on my calendar per day it does really make sense for me to use it looks nice
__label__2 the current day shows events for the next day and seemingly no option to change it very annoying
__label__2 annoying to set up you'd think it would be easy to have the exact same same schedule just 30 min later
__label__5 great app todoist will send reminders that i have 0 due for the day this makes me think twice if i really have nothing to complete for the day which that is not the case so it makes me add task and by the end of the day i got some things done
__label__1 i have had this app for 2 years and absolutely loved it after an update it would cut on automatically and freeze my phone i would have to hit the open apps and close it before i could do anything with my phone i have emailed and explained what it was doing and i get am email wanting more explanation so i did several days later i get an email that wants a video showing i don't think this will get fixed i paid for the pro version and i will not renew
__label__5 you rock from grumpy grandma than you so much
__label__2 wish i can repeat sirten things without spending money every year
__label__3 first reaction to new design much worse now cluttered how can i allocate from inbox to task group or whatever they're called why break this when it worked frustrating i otherwise love todoist it is seamless and i have been managing tasks with that for ages clearing my mind thx for response below but pls don't break what works nicely
__label__5 it is so good
__label__1 buggy flickers and won't let me scroll to bottom or won't let me select i want wunderlist back it was perfect
__label__2 does this app truly have reminders it refused to remind me of my event
__label__3 ok but doesn't feel too user friendly and kinda weird that the calendar is behind a paywall
__label__5 great for organization i love the color scheme and wide access works great with reminders and has a good set up
__label__3 looking good todo manager the premium was already expensive for india but i just realized that not only they increased the price but the price indians pay would be more than the us price now that's called a rip off
__label__4 a great way to get organized and remember your to do list
__label__5 easy to use and functional with features i
__label__1 it's simple enough to set up a task or event but not once has it reminded me as set to so looking for one that will
__label__4 i love this format only thing that would make it better is some form of active side scrolling gameplay element build your character throughout the week and then try to beat a level sort of thing
__label__3 overall it's pretty darn good the only problem i have with the app right now is that the crown doesn't work for scrolling please integrate this simple feature for five stars
__label__1 i will use other app i will not pay
__label__4 easiest way for me to use habitica simple but motivating i'm not sure if moving the plus button to the center was a good idea it covers more of the text of the tasks there though it is a easy to forget that you need to pull down on the tasks section to see any changes in inventory tables
__label__3 it is an ok app as far as personal entries are concerned and the connected functions of name time and place can not count on it to keep you informed about set calender events though as they are set default in 2014 mothers day was on the 8th 2nd sunday in may this year not wednesday the 11th they can thank my wife for keeping me informed it is a scheduling app and if the default events are wrong as well as uneditable how confusing will your scheduling be keep an accurate calendar handy
__label__3 this app is easy to use but my biggest issue is that when i add notes or check off tasks when off line they dont save
__label__2 super super buggy on my note 8 can't press anything on the character creation menu after registering justin the tip guy always comes up after pressing any of the menus super super annoying please fix a s a p
__label__3 excellence app but now widget error on asus zenfone max 3
__label__1 lmao this app is so bad setting events is a pain time zones don't work the from time and to time of an event don't work if you trust this app for your planning i'm sure you'd go mad because of missing important meetings due to wrong time setting just use microsoft outlook etc and pay for it this one is a waste of time
__label__5 very good app
__label__1 premium version only
__label__5 a user friendly app
__label__1 i really wanted to love this app it looks amazing has so much potential however the app does not sync to your timezone my day does not reset at midnight despite what the app says when i try to change the reset time to match up with the incorrect timezone it keeps switching back to midnight so my day randomly resets usually around 6 or 7 pm sometimes the day doesn't reset for more than 24 hours my avatar takes damage for the missed day makes it impossible to effectively use
__label__2 worked really well however the widgets work for a day then won't respond unless removed and re added eevveerryy day won't remember to actually use it without the widgets so its useless now not worth paying extra
__label__4 i need help the app does not send notifications about my tasks even i had put a time to go off and allowed all the permissions in my smartphone configuration
__label__1 seems a good app but can't use the basic functions without paying for premium eg can't have a reminder at a certain time of day without premium surely the basic function of a reminder app is reminders on a certain day or time premium is 36 so expensive loads of free alternatives out there
"__label__2 won't let me use access weekly view unless i pay 7 99 for the year what a 
crock i'll find another app"
__label__5 awesome
__label__3 not too bad
__label__1 its not working properly
__label__4 it would be better if we can insert pictures in the tasks but all in all it was cute and helpful
__label__3 would love to be able to add daily reminders qith ease
__label__5 great app works very well it helps alot especially at this time with this pandemic helps to keep everything that you need to keep track of what and where you should be and to keep track of your symptoms and must know information check this app out
__label__4 seems like there is a bug when trying to sync my notes to my dropbox account would give you 5 stars if fixed
__label__1 okay the app is good i even got the bro version but its missing a serious things like for an instance there is no way to change the break time or even knowing the long break times i cant delete a pomodoro that i made unless i did a data clear which is unfair for all the other pomodoro i did pls fix this
__label__3 like the app so far but i went into the settings and changed the appearance of my standard view to month yet everytime i open the app the standard view shows day instead of month
__label__1 deducted my money for no reason i used the service once and then never used it return my money immediately
__label__4 simple app that provides all i need to track habits ui could use a refresher
__label__3 nice planner but you shouldn't have to pay to have week view i may not purchase now
__label__3 the app is great but i really don't like new dark styles with orange details color please add the ability to change details color back to blue or some others
__label__3 there are ads even though there wasnt any label of contains ads in this app description
__label__3 widget isn't opening calendar i've deleted and restarted and when i use the 3x1 i think it opens to the day only and won't go back to the month view like it used to
__label__2 at first i really liked it because all the systems are functioning well in my phone but when i used this in the tab the notifications wont even turn i sm really pissed by this and i hope you fix this asap
__label__1 bestapp ever super useful the only reason for the bad review is because i already paid for the pro version of this app because it's that useful but it's very disappointing this app is not supported by my google watch its not compatible with my ax armani connected smart watch please fix it would be very useful to see my appointments and errands displayed on my watch without having to open my phone to view than thanks alot i'll removed the bad feed back onces its fixed 5 stars
__label__3 i love the app except that the widget does not remember customizations such as default calendar not using 24 hour time if this could be more flexible and keep the settings of the apps i would definitely rate five stars it's helped save time having multiple uses for one app but i need the widget compatibility
__label__3 it's okay but the tasks are too simple not a good way to integrate and organize them
__label__2 not able to install on more than two devices i found this frustrating as i had one phone stolen and another broke now i can t download on my new phone because it s already on the other with my main email does not allow another email not too pleased about this
__label__3 g o o d
__label__2 fun and helpful graphics are awesome just needs a few tweaks too easy to cheat i don't like the tavern because i am in recovery from drugs and alcohol so it's kinda anthemic maybe a temple option would be a better social forum for inclusion for those of us who don't drink and or use drugs it would also be nice if you could continue to see completed to do items after you have checked them so you can continue to visualize your progress
__label__2 not exactly useful was hoping it would be easier to see or more customizable
__label__1 too many ads and it doesn't automatically save your work also everytime i exit and reopen it it brings me to a different page than i was on
__label__4 not as good as its old version wunderlist especially when you want to upload and download files through this app
__label__5 one of the best to do app in playstore this combines the strength of gtd pomodoro and lot of customization options hats off to the developers you guys have really added value in my life through this app thank you
__label__5 quite simply the best cannot get over how user friendly todoist is the devs clearly designed with intention pre made templates are a godsend text markup emoji integration made me smile and powerful organizational features made me stay kudos
__label__3 i really like must of the app but it has 2 horrible bugs that made me uninstall it whenever i make a new event in the widget it places it a day after the date that i chose and then the edit button doesn't work and you are stuck with it and it might get confusing i might download it again if that is fixed
__label__3 very motivational but what's with the subscription fee fifteen dollars a year
__label__2 1 5 20 i have tried the updates since my original post and launch speed has slightly improved main landing page loads very slowly but at least didn't crash right away again almost froze when scrolling through habits i gave it more time to load then tried going to a different section of the app it crashed 11 9 19 would be an awesome app if it would load painfully slow startup and very laggy in app as a well android 9 moto g6 play please fix i will actually update my review
__label__4 a little confusing to navigate at first but otherwise useful
__label__1 it's not a user friendly app too much complicated usage it's of no use don't have an option of recurring task its not mobile friendly app i prefer not use this app in my life waste of money and i dont know why this one cost is 300 bucks
__label__3 the app does not work i can use my phone freely but it seems like a great app also there is no instructions for lg phones
__label__4 it's very simple to use you can make your list easily and remind your tasks at the moment thank's
__label__2 this is a nicely made app and premium is cheap but one critical flaw is the reminder sound runs through the ringtone channel instead of the alarm channel or even the media channel so unless you enjoy hearing every single notification go off on your phone or your ears are super sensitive to vibrations from across the room this app is not fit for purpose a shame i just pooched my free trial now
__label__4 good app and really helpful with time management and staying organized
__label__2 add a feature that let's me tick tasks off from the widget either than that i love the app
__label__1 this app only connects you with google calendar and that's it not useful
__label__1 real tress can be planted using paid version of the app so why should i download this free fake version
__label__3 okay better than others but the design should be material some features are to pay less than the competitor but still i cant use fully for that
__label__2 i keep completing tasks and the next day they open automatically again and the notification pops up its very irritating and confusing what's the point of opening a completed task maybe you need to add an option to permanently close repeat tasks vs close them for that day
__label__5 the perfect planner app i'm so thankful for artful agenda
__label__2 i wish there was a one time payment option and a dark mode i can't add another subscription to the msny i already have
__label__2 it's a great idea but it just doesn't work the pages never refresh for the next day and if i press the refresh button it just comes up with an unable to connect to server error or just stays with the loading symbol infinitely i went on it today after not going on it for a couple of days and i just find that im dead out of nowhere the refill health prompt kept repeatedly popping up and then when it stopped my health bar was still at zero also the add habit button isnt there always
__label__1 my entire plan was suddenly removed
__label__1 loved this app until my reminders no longer pop up on my screen in other words i'm not being reminded which is the whole point of the app really disappointing after enjoying it for a couple of years hope it gets fixed but currently looking for a different app that works
__label__3 i missed the old tiny tree that was at before for 10 minutes of focusing i truely missed it
__label__4 when i have open appointment and switch to different task lost all unsaved changes missing me that open appointment is not listed in taskmanager as running task
__label__3 it's ok it definitely isn't worth paying for premium also lack of syncability with google assistant is a huge drawback for me
__label__1 bad
__label__4 i really love this app but notifications are not working at all even after i allow all the permissions so i'm not able to use this app
__label__3 i had an older version of this app on my previous phone and loved it however the usability has gone way down somewhere in between you need to get rid of the analog clock thing when adding reminders it takes way too many finger taps than is necessary to set a simple reminder for a given task and annoyingly resets to the current day and time every time you try to edit a reminder you have created this is confusing and makes it hard to use this app on the go which is when i need it most
__label__4 better than most user friendly
__label__5 intuitive and fun
__label__3 i used to love this app but since installing the latest version on my new samsung 10 the google tasks sync has stopped working it synchronises from google to business calendar but will not synchronise from business calendar to google i have tried disconnecting my google account and reconnecting i've made sure bc2 tasks is associated with my google account and all sync settings are turned on is this is a known issue and if so will a fix be developed please thanks
__label__2 i had my phone switched off one day at the time my reminder usually pops up ever since then i've not got notifications at all no matter if i try reset them or whatever kinda annoying because the calendar app on my phone has also stopped giving notifications lately so i keep forgetting to take my medication
__label__3 being constantly prompted to share list is a big pain in the butt my wife and i share our info with each other and it's a big nag that may cause us to abandon ms todo
__label__1 bad experience the support is the worst ever and no thought has been put except for the visual ui the ux is bad
"__label__5 i like using this app helps me write when i most need it and has helped me 
use it whenever i can't explain or express myself so thank you"
__label__5 seems to be usable i am too accustomed to wunderlist i wish i could star items to be put on a starred list
__label__3 i'm giving it three stars right now til i know how to properly use all the features but so far it's the best app i've used so far you can organize lists for home and work and other things so it's not confusing and easy to set dates
__label__2 слишком сложно но при этом нет того что нужно очень много возможностей но не смог элементарно сделать todo список на _каждый_ день и постоянно лезут с предложением купить премиум да не вопрос если бы был необходимый функционал ощущение что приложение разработано рубить бабло но при этом не задумываясь о потребностях пользователя
__label__3 gamification is good designed but the app works kind of laggy 5 star when redesigned
__label__1 this is a really smart way to keep you off your phone and motivated to work and i would love to use this app all day everyday but it needs a pause button desperately life is full of things that pop up out the blue and in its current state you loose all progress or get rewarded for doing nothing please please please add an optional pause button there are already a bunch of optional thing to tweak it please add this i would go pro in a heart beat and it would become my top app
__label__3 no matter what i do even setting 'no notifications' when creating event or task they continually pop up not happy with this feature
__label__5 sencilla práctica y cumple como debería si buscás una app para anotar tareas o recordatorios está es la indicada lo mejor es que puedes tener la app tanto en celular como en ordenador y lo que anotas en uno se actualiza en el otro
__label__2 i'm probably too old for this couldn't find the energy patience to work out how it works and why was it preset with meditation i guess it would seem obvious to someone who uses technology more bought a huge paper planner called trigg instead less portable but it won't crash malfunction or lost if i break my phone
__label__3 this app has a nice interface and a great idea but it seems to suffer the same issue i've found of all habit trackers i can't easily keep track of multiple daily iterations of a habit if i want to create a habit of say drinking 5 bottles of water a day i want to be able to check off and keep track of each bottle drunk then get rewarded when i finish all five most of the habits i want to develop fall in this category could this be implemented in the future
__label__4 i love this app and has been using it for more than a year but lately it has bugs which changes the days when i opened it per days please fix it
__label__1 this app is very very very sexist when you start the app up and go into the icon menu for the avatar of your hero character the vast majority of the icons possibile to select are definitively male worse yet is that all of the ones 'intresting' in thier design or portray something such as the workplace are entirely male the few female icons avalible more than half not even on their own are showing an entirely narrow view with a subservient feeling in thier portrayal the developers of this app should be ashamed of such blatant misogyny
__label__3 nice app but ux can be improved
__label__5 love for scheduling but more for grocery lists
__label__5 this is my dream calendar app it works perfectly with my google calendar while also offering list making capabilities as well as meal planning as a mom and business owner it gives me everything i need in a digital calendar
__label__2 you have to upgrade to get notifications
__label__2 guys it is troubling me a lot recently after every day it stops working and i have tried reinstalling the app many time but serves no help kindly fix it
__label__3 please add app option to put new task at the top of the list for those that are coming from wunderlist
__label__3 it's really a great app and good concept to cure phone addiction but i've some ideas for making it more interesting introduce forest customization options like a real forest add animals cascades etc anyway great work guys
__label__3 i love everything about this app except for how it handles snoozing repeat tasks it's easy to use and has a lot of configuration something a lot of other apps save for the premium version unfortunately i find it unusable due to how snoozing repeat tasks then alters the date time for all future occurrences making it difficult to manage these tasks when i just want to snooze it this one time if this was changed i would give 5 stars and upgrade to premium as the app is otherwise perfect
__label__1 love this app got the pro version it will save a lot of my cognitive work please fix this bug the colour of events are set to blue when the event is created using the default colour of the sub calendar overall the app needs better ux design w r t the complex menu for customization and some other things e g it was hard to figure out how to get separate widget for different calendars but in terms of functionality it is awesome
__label__4 good app usefull
__label__5 this is a perfect app for tracking and building habits
__label__4 i love that i can check things off as i do them throughout the day and not the next day they reset so i can go to the list again without repeatingly putting them in the only thing i wish is either i could send the results daily to my calendar preferably automatically but at least manually or the app kept a history so i could tell how often i completed my goals love snooze option too
__label__3 for 2 6 1 timetune background task error keep persists due to screen is off battery saver powered off you can also add new features refresh background tasks when accessing app toggle switch it refreshes everytime when they accessing the app even background tasks blocked by system
__label__4 to do list works good but it is no idiot proof developer needs to add more walk through instructions at start when the app is downloaded when people commit on issues the developer replies offended but the developer did not make a idiot proof way of solving these problems that a newbie with little patience would have instead they lash out its not the user's fault its the developer fault for not understanding the concept of idiot proofing a sound product face it people don't read
__label__4 it's really nice but i wish the notifications were better like for some reason i don't get notified even though the task is due it would also be good if we can add urls beneath the name of the task so that we can directly visit the link
__label__1 paid for the upgrade but the weather functionality doesn't work and moving between months inside the calendar is not intuitive i'd like a refund please
__label__4 great app i just wish one thing could change some of my habits need a long title and it doesnt show the full title if i click 'all habits' or even on each single habit if the title could allow more characters or another line i'll add the last star lol please
__label__4 i like it a lot but it doesn't have as much of the game aspect to it i wish there was a feature where you character could actually play in an rpg game using the equipment and skills you earned you could have a little rpg game on the side and has cute little morality stories without it it doesn't really incentivize much
__label__4 despite the unresponsive widget overall a pretty decent app
__label__3 i loved this app when i used it 2 years ago but can i no longer log in
__label__4 a very good pie chart graphical view of your schedule with nice colours and everything is good about the app specially the graphical side i'm not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today my whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45 looking as faded blue and nothing else was there i also have screen shot of the error if developers need it else it's a great app soon will buy the pro version
__label__2 the app is crashing and not working plz help xdaofficial edit now i can't even sign in all settings are in mandarin
__label__1 i agree with other reviewers here the new notification redesign from v5 3 0 on android 10 is a bad idea and results in a confusing and unhelpful user experience the new notifications violate google's material design standards which google have provided to app developers for a good reason to provide a consistent user experience across all apps the new notifications look strange and behave badly compared to standard android notifications please kindly revert back to the official android notification standards that you used prior to v5 3 0 i've also sent you an email providing more details about this
__label__5 simply the best app for productivity best user interface out there and best reminder service offers great widgets too
__label__3 when the screen goes off and you on your phone but did not press into an app the tree will be killed and waste your efforts a lot of features are also locked and only premium which doesn't help with productivity the achievements sector of the app cannot be seen and the tress dies without reasons
__label__5 its nice easy to use but has lots of functions
__label__5 ive used this app a couple times now only uninstalling because school ended but this app is amazing when it comes down to it it encourages people to do the stuff that they need to without the complication of being told off by others plus it has a cool rpg theme thats great for anybody who has grown up with rpg game like elements
__label__2 its ok
__label__3 this apps not suitable for my needs the reminder keep show every day even the task mark as 'done' everyday i do click 'done' at reminder the next day and next day and next day the reminder still come up the logic for the apps does not make sense for me i'm not a paid subscribber
__label__5 to do list is so much easier to achieve than before
__label__3 it's effective yes it's better than a lot of other options out there it's just dated the interface is weak and difficult to navigate they could really make some strong improvements by streamlining it i bet most users pro or not aren't aware of all the settings response 8 8 19 thanks for the offer but i think you're missing point if i had time to help i would have long ago though response i wouldn't have paid for an app that required me that much submit feedback in a forum
__label__3 i like this application a lot it is a very productive too they only issue i have is with the notifications they seem to quit working after a while i don't know what necessarily makes them start working again either starting the app back up restarting my phone or both nothing else seems to have this issue
__label__1 kicks me out of the game instantly not for me
__label__1 i've had this app for years even upgraded it to the premium version loved it then as the developers started updating i started having many issues each time i used the app it would show in the premium or free version it was inconsistent i wrote the customer service for assistance and i didn't get any help so i lived with it most recently i started receiving ads after every entry not okay i sent another email 2 wks ago which they have not responded to which is why i'm here help
__label__2 i would not recommend this app bc of an essential flaw in design it doesn't allow you to just type in habit instead it quizzes you so a simple act of just typing what you'd like to do turns into this crazy and overly complicated thing
__label__3 very pleased practical and clear upset that 1 i paid for and installed an upgrade on my phone but this did not happen on my tablet all i get is advert for upgrade but at extra cost 2 tasks is accessed in 3 steps why not 1
__label__4 becoming undispensable very fast
__label__3 super app with horrible widget you can mistakenly complete a task by clicking on widget and it's gone without you even noticing it free apps have better widget honestly
__label__1 update after i read the reply i redownloaded this app waste of 4 25 it's not worth any amount of money not a lot of extras to charge money and it's only cute on a computer the lists are not very easy to make and i never did find the meal plan or journal parts the goal part is not on the app any do is free and a lot easier for lists with reminders and also includes a calendar not worth the cost yeah it's cute but not as easy to use as other free calendars pretty disappointed
__label__5 love it lets you make multiple lists and lets you move items up and down to prioritize most useful out of several to do list apps i've tried
__label__1 while using the habbit feature you can add multiple reminders for drinking water but if you check done in any one of those reminders then it wont remind for the rest of the day ruins the logic uninstalled installed a year later and still the issue exists the habit feature was a unique point which brought me to the app but i guess i'll have to use another one
__label__5 awesome app i found in this app exactly i want with this app all tasks can be completed in a very organized way with proper timing
__label__3 not all can afford premium for reminder
__label__2 i had my phone switched off one day at the time my reminder usually pops up ever since then i've not got notifications at all no matter if i try reset them or whatever kinda annoying because the calendar app on my phone has also stopped giving notifications lately so i keep forgetting to take my medication
__label__3 would love to be able to add daily reminders qith ease
__label__3 needs registration for online use
__label__5 great planning app reliable and easy to use
__label__5 great to do list app that handles reminders well it is perfect for my needs
__label__4 i really love this app for so many reasons above all it's keeps me organized and punctual what i wish i could change or maybe i can and just can figure out how is how to make the widget color pallet settings the same on my os wear thats why i bought the extra options innthe first place my watch face doesnt even look like it does in the photos can i change this
__label__5 great app a good replacement for wunderlist supports all platforms and has all the important feature whilst remaining very easy to use unlike some of the competition i would love having a slightly better widget the current one doesn't look very good the tasks aren't in boxes and there's not a good support for rtl writing i suggest aligning the text to the left even when having rtl text so every task is on the left side and it's not mixed up
__label__1 unable to use the widget
__label__2 at first this app worked well then the next day this app stopped notifying my next activities it stucked on the last activity before the next day
__label__3 i don't see where you can use voice to make tasks
__label__3 please bring back the old ui for routine edits with horizontal stripes please or at least give the option to select a preference please thanks it makes it more editing a little more difficult and much less appealing please
__label__2 new update has lost the ability to click on the widget and open the list full screen the font is smaller and ticking off an item on the widget has became more difficult please fix five stars otherwise
__label__3 i like this app a lot it is refreshing but to be 5 stars i should have more flexibility in setting intervals like selecting days of the week so i can have work and nonwork day schedules that easily repeat when i add something to a schedule a 10min before alarm should not be default i'm using the app to plan my day primarily finally each new entry should default its begin time to the last entry's end time with the new end time shortly after say 30 min later that would be a 5 star app
__label__5 great app helped me get my time optimized and scheduled thank you very much developers 1 suggestion would be to add auto backup on the cloud through google and so on
__label__3 for 24 hour version need to buy app no free trials
__label__5 it's an awesome apps to maintain daily work and get notify
__label__3 too many crashes over the past few months especially in the widget
__label__3 timezone feature broken the gamification was a little too complicated and too much for my needs
__label__2 please i need help when i try to log in with google in the app it said unknown error occurred please check again in a few seconds i've uninstalled and re installed the app but no such luck
__label__5 this app is literally like a dream come true it is girly and has all of the things a paper planner has but electronically i love it
__label__3 i have been using this app for a while really trying to get to grips with it but i've come to conclude that it's not me if you feel like you need less complexity in your life them this probably isn't for you as this adds a new system that you have to get to grips with and plus the gamification aspect can be quite destracting and finnecky i think if this were to ever be useful for me it would need a separate environment for tasks habits and dailies
__label__3 i used to love the app until i needed to synchronise to see my tasks to another device then i found out syncing simply won't work and uninstalling reinstalling didn't solve the issue
__label__3 lots of unnecessary notifications the gui is confusing and is missing a few features for a habit tracking app like splurging only every x days but no less
__label__3 this app was very helpful up until the last update where they inexplicably took away the lock forest to stay in foreground feature as of right now it's basically useless but the support staff is great and said they were hoping to bring back the feature so other than that it would be 5 stars don't change the feature that keeps people off their phones
__label__4 best productivity app i've found goal progress tracking hierarchical task management and progress reports would make it even better
__label__5 i don't often buy apps above the basic level but business calendar and now business calendar 2 has helped me keep track of appointments so well for so long that i did i've now had premium for almost a year still thoroughly enjoy the added functionality appreciate that the app is fully functional albeit with some added time required in some cases at the free level thanks for such a great app please make this app for iphone too so my partner i can use the same calendar app
__label__1 this is update on 22 feb 2020 i don't know what happened to the app but it now annoys me every second time i open it with some ridiculous animated games which hijack the whole phone for about 30 seconds and then goes to google play asking to download the idiotic game not sure if it's the app itself or if it's been hacked in either case i am uninstalling this excellent app i've been using it for many years now since its predecessor all good with app
__label__2 laggiest experience ever icons were missing everywhere it seemed really cool but quite unplayable for me
__label__5 is there a black theme coming up
__label__3 i really like the concept but the app widget doesn't recognise 'reminders' only 'events' if my day was organised hour by hour with events then this would be ideal but i rarely have more than 2 events per half day reminders i use all the time if the widget recognised those then it would be far more useful to me would still recommend despite this
__label__5 so far the app has functioned excellently i have not run into any issues it's very simple and straight forward however i do recommend you read the user start guide as you'll find out about not so intuitive functions which make everything not only more seamless but even simpler than before i would seriously recommend to anyone looking for a todo app i've been using the free version and no complaints and no ads definitely give it a try and you won't regret it
__label__3 sticky notification bar should show task according to the up next time strictly rather its showing randomly
__label__3 it makes you rate the app and its extremely annoying
__label__3 seems pretty neat but i miss one feature thst is very important for me be able to just hit start stop for tasks thst needs to be done for at least x minutes per day i dont check or remember time when i start doing something
__label__4 great app had a quirk pop up last year but historically best user interface synced well and wonderful functionality
__label__1 the user interface makes no sense
__label__1 rubbish app doesn't sound on time
__label__2 after years of using wunderlist and organizing both my professionell and my private life with the app i made the switch to microsoft todo after they announced that the wunderlist service will be terminated around mai this year 2020 first impression was good and after years of using wunderlist i felt at home but on the first day in the office came the shock you can not manually reorder the tasks seriously that undermines how i and i guess a lot of people use a todo list
__label__1 can't even start it properly just says path 'profile name' is required
__label__2 this app was everything i needed i loved it but after thenlast update i cannot log in to my account so i cannot see my daily schedule will not trust it again and i have already unistalled it i need an organizing app which i can trust fortunately all the events were synced to my google calendar but notes and tasks didnt so i dont know if i am forgeting something that is pending now
__label__4 3rd week great for monitoring things you want to become habits the humor in the notifications is lost on me i wish for non monitoring days there would be a third color option with a continuance of the chain other than that its simole to setup and simple to use
__label__3 great app and well thought of love the wear os integration however paying for the full version i wish there was more customizable options such as custom background or custom font for the numbers would be great to include that
__label__3 should help you more
__label__2 unable to edit time for reminder s7
__label__3 eu amo este aplicativo e uso sincronizado com o meu google calendar porem de um tempo para cá mesmo com a configuraçao para manter no google calendar as tarefas ja executadas no todolist o evento do google calendar some podem verificar era muito importante pra mim que os eventos continuassem no google calendar minha versao nao é premium e estava pensando em comprar estou com medo de comprar e continuar assim obrigada
__label__4 it would be a very good choice for those who want a daily base motivation to make your way to build on the habbit try not to break the streak of your habbit goals at any cost from which you can gain the max from this app well built interface with motivational images loved it
__label__4 helps me to plan my day what i'm missing widget shows comming events only and you can't see the previous events so when you are a bit late the widget is not helping
__label__3 enjoyed it's use while it lasted uninstalled now
__label__2 great app with one major flaw when entering addresses and selecting from the drop down options the house disappears and leaves only the street city and state without the actual house or business number this is a huge problem for me
__label__2 reminder notification not on time for about an hour so it is inconvenient
__label__3 the concept is good but why the app is not notifying me about thr task even though i have turned the notification on this is very bad
__label__2 few days after downloading it shows that forest app can't open or open app again
__label__2 there are better options available i just didn't like the layout and functionality of the app i tried it for a couple of months but now it's deleted and i am going to try another
__label__5 just realized that my purchase license is back it's premium again now thank you very much and i do appreciate it so dev you deserve my 5 stars rating back this lovely app gets better and better on every update and runs flawlessly in android 10 now i can reuse it for my daily assistance again a big thank
__label__3 have not used the app
__label__2 so what you take away wunderlist make us use this much more convoluted app and do not even have a choice of widgets
__label__4 the only suggestion i have is to make it so if you deactivate then reactivate a habit it doesn't take your percentage down as if it was active the while time
__label__4 it's a bit redundant when dealing with recurrent tasks doesn't allow scheduling those recurrent tasks to specific times of the day or set an expiry date for the recurrence but otherwise quite functional and useful
__label__5 great app very useful for both personal and work reminders
__label__1 reducing to one star because it is not possible either sync the data with cloud or backup locally inspite using the paid version and the developer is not bothered to rectify the issue
__label__3 love this planner but whenever i use the repeat function i cant just edit 1 event i have to edit the rest of the events that are linked together too would be great if i'm able to edit jus 1 event even when im using the repeat function would also be great if there's a copy and paste of events function would make things really easier
__label__5 it's my most favourite app thanks for creating such an amazing app
__label__5 really help me to organize my schedule
__label__4 one of the best to do list apps i've used
__label__3 it actually is a good app but it wont do the one other thing i need it to do which is notify me of a task i set one day it does and the others it doesn't i have reset my phone settings several times because of this looked it up and still no results
__label__4 it really helps me for studying and keeps me in focus i also likes to grow many trees in my forest so i study by keeping the timer on and at the end i have studied than i thought and many beautiful trees are too grown
__label__1 like others have said before it was the best todo list app but now it's painful to do even simple things specifically the additional pop up window on mobile app is just horrible
__label__5 excellent if you use it properly the only thing i would change is the notification and alarms settings i want notifications to come through even when i'm not actively looking at the app right now i'm not notified until i open the app and the pop ups show up
__label__5 excelent app use it daily sortable tasks sortable sub tasks many reminder options see only what you need to do today or this week or customize date using widget paid version is worth it too i have had the servers go down a couple of times in the last few months may change rating of it becomes a regular problem
__label__3 font too small
__label__3 helpful but not too much
__label__5 been using habitica for a few months tried a few other to do list games none of them beats habitica best way to keep track of daily life and still have fun
__label__5 this is a very cool app perfect although it should have more link options for other apps as well
__label__2 not working properly on redmi note 4
__label__3 i used to love this app but now it has been ruined made things more complicated and v can't assign according to days of week
__label__4 the app is good but we can overide this by changing the system time manually to future ideally after turning on the time the app shouldn't hv allowed to change the screen even to home screen or settings screen then this could have been perfect but android system may not allow to do so
__label__3 nice calandar easy to use there's one thing and that is the lack of a good notification on the screen i mist a few appointments because of that so i deleted the calendar i really liked it but i need a good warning system
__label__4 all it needs is the option to set a pic from the gallery as an icon if that happens in the next update i'll give 5 stars
__label__5 i chose this calendar for its widgets which are the best among all the apps i tried this combined with fine controls are the reasons i haven't looked back for several years now
__label__5 love it i'm actually getting things done it takes a little bit of learning to work out how to make recurring tasks etc but once you do it's all there free version
__label__4 its the best app when it comes to tracking your progress but one problem thats why i didnt give it a 5 star when you set reminders it doesn't work maybe on my phone but it doesn't send you reminders besides that its really a good app to kick start 2020
__label__3 it's a cool app and it kinda helps me but you are forced to be a warrior it says you can change your class in the settings but there is no option
__label__5 fam this app is fire no cost ease of use and fun to track progress
__label__4 good calendar but short on extras
__label__5 great
__label__2 would you quit directing me to the website if i want to join a party guild it should be done on the app it won't let me log in on the site at all why you people would choose to have it so if you use log in using google it resets and begins a whole new account without asking now i have two accounts on one email it won't even give me my password i tried resetting it several times how annoying bad design after i spent so much time on the app too all for it not to work
__label__2 pretty solid app does what it seems but one problem for me is that the alarms don't go off when they're supposed to instead of going off at the time i set they all go off next time i open the app they never go off until i open the app so they're useless
__label__2 update i know it's a one time fee as stated that i had already paid same acct now i don't have pro i've had it for a while now and had purchased the pro version right away my reason for giving 2 star now is all of a sudden it tells me i do t have the pro feature anymore that is supposed to be a 1 time payment also if there was a desktop version that would be majorly useful disappointed that i would have to pay for pro again if i wanted to continue those features
__label__4 looking forward to a better ui ux will keep using it
__label__1 not a stand alone app must use calendar on mobile my pout was to use it on its own
__label__3 very simle with few functions maybe for childrens there are missing a lot of usual functions that others free app have time tracking a true calendar where you add tasks by minutes steps no task subtask numbering no tabel spreadshets tasks no custom fields no timesheet etc on this premium account if you want and work with advanced gtd planners project management go away and dont lose your time
__label__3 would have give this app 5stars however everytime i restart my phone the app won't load i have to re install it everytime its annoying the widget
__label__3 can't load
__label__4 this is a good app requesting you to add some more options 1 one is sorting for all tasks by date by alphabet etc 2 and the second option is to add search option for finding out any task which we already added 3 the task on the bottom end is not visible because of the add button please correct it
__label__2 lacks option to automatically skip all missed recurrences on recurring tasks manual skipping of missed recurrences is not a powerful enough solution
__label__5 i like the idea i've been using this for about 4 months i guess until now i haven't any complaints
__label__3 my life is a game and i should quit to desktop lmao
__label__4 i'm using 2 calenders and 1 to do planner not including this all has their pros and functions i want yet they're different in style this is one of the best i just love using the week view seeing at one shot time of events laid out in planner including notes on that day with pics uploaded if needed it sync with my anydo planner which has a calender but i just love how i can use this a bit differently for scheduling best if only it has a daily mood tracker added in the notes function
__label__3 a add shortcut to home screen is broken on my pixel 3 b please add delete all completed task to overflow menu besides the hide feature c widgets are seriously broken their color theme is incorrect white but should be dark and widget is empty even though list it shows is not
__label__3 ok its useful
__label__1 been using this app for many years the recent update has brought ads uninstalling
__label__3 i just downloaded the app and tried to make a reminder but i didn't get any notification do i have to keep my mobile data on if i want to get notified
__label__4 i love this app and the idea behind it with the weekly and daily routines i wish i could view my month or week at a glance however so i can see my weekly routine and how my non reoccurring events affect and lay out with my routine
__label__3 5 years after acquiring wunderlist microsoft has still failed to replicate the great to do list manager critical features missing include natural language support for due dates not available for android or desktop grouping of lists and email notifications for reminders the app has come a long way but man what a shame it's taken 5 yrs and they still haven't even matched the old app and now they're sunsetting wl that's 5 yrs which could have been used to enhance an already great app
__label__4 very versatile keeps you on the track and highlights your strengths and weaknesses so impressed that i bought premium on very first day to have unlimited habits 4 stars only because there is no possibility to set monthly repeated task neither on a specific date e g 3th of every month nor on specific day e g second wednesday in a month otherwise it would be 5
__label__5 excellent tool
__label__3 app crashing a lot do look into it and solve the problem asap
__label__5 this is bad ass i really love the originality of the concept
__label__4 i really like this app the concept of blocking your times is great and i find it helps me structure my time really well it's also a load off of my mind knowing that i don't need to think about when to eat or what time to check my email because i am at ease knowing it's all planned for and i will be informed accordingly my only disappointment with the service and not the app is that i am unable to structure my timeline online on a pc i think there are limitations of the mobile device that makes the scheduling somewhat confusing i think it will be perfect to incorporate a way to set up your schedule on a nice large screen and use your phone for viewing and notifications
__label__4 i really like this app some things could improve like the quote box fitting the whole quote in it and the colors being more distinguishable thanks
__label__3 having some problems figuring out what all this app offers still learning it
__label__2 i like how its organized and how many choices and the customization but i set alarms and keep in mind i have all permissions on and it didnt go on my screen so i missed a very important meeting
__label__3 better tips it will great we can customize without google calender
__label__1 alarms or notifications don't work unless you open the app then it floods all the notifications for the tasks as i open the app defeats the purpose of the app tedious round about way to delete a habit compared to deleting a task not sure how this app got a 4 6 rating
__label__1 i bought premium and now i can't login to the app using facebook and i can't login any other way i get this message login failed you can't use facebook to log into this app or website because there's an issue with its implementation of facebook login
__label__3 does what it's meant to limited to the amount of list you can make unless you pay for premium
__label__4 love the app but the reminder function is not working well otherwise app is awesome plz requested to fix it soon
__label__3 if it had reminders in free version it would have been the best to do list
__label__5 lifesaver i am very forgetful but this app along with alexa make sure i remember the simplest of things every day love it
__label__5 great app very user friendly and practical thanks
__label__3 practical and easy to use
__label__5 house
__label__4 good app so far only problem is that there are some events that dont give me the delete option why is that
__label__3 the app crashes quite often recently but when it works it's really useful to manage events and meetings easy to use
__label__4 very good app it's simple yet you can add layers to your tasks my only issue is that you need to pay for some features that are important for executing your tasks
__label__4 helpful in making list of work
__label__5 great app for managing and completing tasks in a form of projects
__label__4 4 zzz z z zz z
__label__1 absolutely terrible customer service they refused after several years to fix the 9 7 tablet aspect ratio for a paying customer this is absolutely poor customer service has never work properly once don't buy those that run away
__label__5 i love this app it keeps me organized and is simple to use it has a lot of features in the free version but isnt too complicated some apps try to do too much not this one it does what i need and it does it well i love the feature to make lists or schedule tasks set a tasks priority or quickly move it to tomorrow when i've over scheduled myself highly recommend
__label__4 it's cool because it's gives me motivation to push myself and allow me to see my struggle in addiction for every day i fail
__label__4 it gives a nice visual look at the day
__label__3 mostly works well but i am rather disappointed with the syncing issues my wife and i are experiencing i'm unsure as to what microsoft has changed from the wunderlist app that i've been forced to switch from but this app does not work as quickly and nicely as wunderlist did which i had been using for 2 to 3 years constantly because it worked so well please revise this app so that connectivity problems from servers can be solved i am unable to sync some all of my shared lists
__label__3 no snooze option for reminders this causes some task misses please look at the app to do reminder with alarm for reminder buzz types and options it would be good if these features are added in future
__label__2 only 5 free without telling users upfront that you will have to pay for more always about the money sorry i wasted time on setting this up
__label__4 habitica is awesome only thing that it's hard to feed your pets with the app
__label__5 love it this app has really helped me stay focused on my school work and i feel really good that my points are going towards planting a real tree the rate of reward is low enough to make it a challenge but high enough to make it satisfying very cool especially for a free app
__label__1 had accumulated 5 habits that lasted 17 days and counting now using a different app this pathetic app that i paid premium for would not sync check internet connection every damn time i paid for the damn app sadly probably past my refund day
__label__3 honestly i would give it 5 star since i'm not going to subscribe or anything but the fact that you need to subscribe just to change the theme just to change it into dark theme is deal breaker so 3 star it is i know you guys also need to make money but for a appearance options need to be paid is a no for me i get it if it's like new option like color coding so you can easily sort stuff things like that
__label__3 it doesn't sound for notification even i had set every options like alarm tone vibrate etc plz reply
__label__4 i like this app but i dont understand why i cant set up tasks that repeat unless they're habits or edit the categories a habit is something you want to always do i want to plan reoccurring tasks that are temporary
__label__3 ok
__label__3 this app has been very helpful in the past i haven't enjoyed the most recent update though hence the 3 stars if i close the forest app so it's not an open tab it doesn't send me back to the forest anymore i haven't changed any permissions it's all exactly the same it allows me to bypass the system which isn't helpful at all please figure it out with the next update i would like my forest app back
__label__3 unfortunately sometimes the reminders don't go off when they're supposed to however i like the easy design so i can just write things quickly
__label__1 each time i check a task in its widget it crashes and doesn't show any thing without any response to the other buttons i was happy to find this app but can't use it because of the infinity crashes
__label__3 too much paid only
__label__2 it is not very flexible it's a pain to make sub lists and quickly edit them i wish when the app opened you see a list of all of your major tasks or a calendar if these things are possible maybe adding a tutorial feature when the app first downloads and opens would help streamline the experience
__label__1 one of your workers better get ahold of me within the next 24 hours because i don't even use this app anymore having used it in months and you guys just took 35 out of my account i want my money now
__label__4 i like this app and i use it everyday for studying and reaching the amount of time i wanna stay focused on my works that need to be done everything is great but i really wish there were an option for us to choose the apps that we need during doing our works and tasks i've study apps and websites i need to use but i can't because of this limit therefore i won't plant trees i wish you could give us options about the apps we wanna use and the ones we don't it's rly a problem please fix this tnx
__label__2 aftre update not run property please fix it
__label__2 i really wanted to like this app but it's just too buggy sometimes i open the app and it doesn't have the icons to switch views also the 12 hour formatting is really flawed and the priority scale seems way too complex high medium low should be enough for most people
__label__5 it has been really easy to use and effortlessly works gives me the of all the habits i am doing together and individually great so far
__label__1 uninstalling took forever to load when my internet connection is just working fine on other apps
__label__3 good but preferred wunderlist before microsoft bought it out
__label__3 good idea but glitches eg i incorrectly logged a day as performing a habit and could not change the fact i had actually broken the chain
__label__5 its awesome 1 download it to manage time 2 time hw 3 stay on track with every day activities 4 easy tolook back on organized time plots to help manage day to day activities it's easy to use and is organized with minimal work you can also use time coins to plant real trees
__label__4 best task app i've found with reminders and a variety of tasks types keep up the good work
__label__4 regardless of my free version this app's intention is to help it's users increase positive habits and reduce negative habits for someone like me who needs feedback the percentage of success gives me an incentive and motivates me to keep the chain going after using this app for almost two months i have been able to analyze and critique a few of the apps features it would be interesting to know scientific statistics of the success of the app and if it is successful in what it is set out to do in regards to the level of engagement i would say that the percentage strategy keeps me coming back to this app for functionality the free version runs smoothly is clear and easy to use for aesthetics it is simple and convenient however i do think that for some users it might be difficult to see due to size of buttons and font size the information is a bit outdated and needs to be cited and should come from more credible sources i do enjoy seeing that there is a discussion board for communication between users from my subjective analysis this app's rating is a 4 1
__label__3 در زبان فارسی به علت راست چین بودن تقویم ماه از راست به چپ ولی ایام هفته از چپ به راست چیده شده و تطابق ندارند لطفا اصلاح کنید
__label__5 it's such a helpful app because i always use this so that i can become more productive and finish what i have to do on time it's also helpful because it helps me remember what i have to do
__label__1 most of the things are paid
__label__3 i think the old version is better than the latest version hope that there is an option to choose between the horizantal or vertical interface the shifting of days from left right is easier than the new one i barely use the app since the change of interface ive been using this for a very long time and it was really helpful
__label__1 puts all info in default google calendar
__label__2 would've been 5 stars but the new full size ads make efficiency impossible those kind of ads are fine when you're playing other games but stopping what i'm doing in a completely un related app is unacceptable i understand the banner ads to keep it running but the full page delayed ads pushed it too far
__label__3 i'll like it more if i can the way i view this apps difficult for me to type in landscape position
__label__3 fun way to track habits it would be great if you could update tasks without an interent connection and then just sync the next time your connected like many other trackers
__label__4 habitica is awesome only thing that it's hard to feed your pets with the app
__label__3 i bought the paid verison it does help us track the habits with simple yes or no questions and by answering with numbers but habits aren't as simple as it is we need other methods to track habits like options to enter time if i want to develop a habit of waking up by 7 it shouldn't be a yes or no question i should be able to enter the time track it over the month
__label__2 was forced to switch to this from wunderlist the only thing better about it is dark mode that extends to widgets everything else sucks i now don't even get about 30 of my reminders anymore and have to constantly reset things microsoft is one of the richest companies on earth and this is the best they can do
__label__2 poor substitute for wunderlist which is going in may all imported well but nowhere near as many settings options and the list font size is far too big so u can only see a small portion of your list on the screen looking for anotjer alternative
__label__2 the newest version doesn't keep my record
__label__3 honestly this app is not so bad but everytime i check other apps my tree doesn't die except if i close all the cards of my phone however i think it's a very good app to stop to use too much your mobile phone but i'd like more changes
__label__2 what i love is that i can make multiple calendars with the same account what are some major problems 1 my events are not inviting or showing up on the calendars of the people who i include in the event sending a text message link doesn't work either 2 i have had events disappear from my calendar without explanation never had this issue with any other calendar and being a person with a very busy schedule and multiple schedules to adhere to this is detrimental p s i paid for premium
__label__1 it doesn't ring the alarm at the right time only when i open my phone it starts ringing useless for me because i want it to ring at the right time and remind me on my realme phone highly disappointed
__label__4 it has a button just for what i need i bit hard to read the scheds though
__label__1 do not purchase the app works as it's supposed to with exception for the added purchase features i bought the app so it could sync up with multiple devices that feature does not work despite following the faq as to why it might not work i have tried their support ticket system which had an automated response but they have yet to respond despite me trying multiple times to reach them and ask for assistance or a refund
__label__1 not what i wanted wanted a timeline
__label__2 the premium version might be good but the free version is more restricted then other to do apps you can not even use the labels tags function without paying if you are looking for a free todo list this is probably not the app for you
__label__2 no android wear app
__label__1 it was a great app until they ruined the widgets i pay for premium membership which is supposed to include priority support and yet their customer service is ignoring my requests for help update yes customer support responded but they didn't solve any of my issues these devs are great at not listening to their customers i've switched to a different task app and i'm much happier tasks by stephen nottage check it out
__label__2 is a good calender but a few singapore holiday was on the wrong date ie hari raya puasa was on 5 6 but calendar show 4 6 deepavali 27 10 was show wrongly on 26 10
__label__5 got this when i realized i got most distracted from my work by looking at my phone really helps me focus when i need to i didn't want one of those apps that completely locks down your phone in case i actually needed to use it for something important but i don't want to kill my trees for unimportant stuff also i like that they have a variety of trees that you have to work to get it makes me more motivated to use the app i hope they add more season themed trees snow covered would be cool
__label__4 hey i have an suggestions for your app i am calling it bug and i would be highly appreciated if u can fix it according to me the ticked task must get deleted by its own else everything is ok and deserves a 4 star if u can fix it i will give it a 5 star rating
__label__4 great app to keep tight training schedules and regimes premium isnt necessary only downfall would be reminders notifications more than once
__label__4 nice but please give option to add different time intervals for habits for example i want to develop habit of drinking water and want the reminder to come at multiple particular times a day the app allows only one specific time for the reminder so please add the mentioned feature
__label__3 missing some key features having the ability to have the same task in multiple lists and an 'undo' button to undo completions deletions done by mistake
"__label__3 the application consistantly tells me i have no internet connection and 
has become a pain to use i know i have internet it is slow but present 
the application would be much more useful if it could keep track and update 
your progress when it feels the connection is stable enough"
__label__2 i miss wunderlist the functionality is so different now and the transition was really bad and i definitely didn't want a microsoft account
__label__1 when i first downloaded the app it worked seamlessly but once i upgraded to the pro version it began to lag and slow down i can't access my timeline store or achievements anymore and it's slow run time is making the app so tedious to use it's becoming an awful app for me
__label__3 i have been using bc2 for a long time i generally like it but the month view widget just stopped displaying my calendars unless i hit the refresh button i use nova launcher please help
__label__3 i liked it nice features but not giving the colour changing option premium only is just cheap i wish i can set my own music for my reminders
__label__2 cannot use because of the 299 entry limit my most important list was split into 7 lists the first list segment is full so i cannot add a new entry to the top of it i copied my lists from wunderlist and several lists got split like that if it had copied starting at the bottom of the list so the first segment was the one not full i might have been able to make it work
__label__3 very simle with few functions maybe for childrens there are missing a lot of usual functions that others free app have time tracking a true calendar where you add tasks by minutes steps no task subtask numbering no tabel spreadshets tasks no custom fields no timesheet etc on this premium account if you want and work with advanced gtd planners project management go away and dont lose your time
__label__2 need to learn more
__label__1 loved for a while one fine day my subtasks got deleted it was in a task for which i didn't set any due date bad experience
__label__2 stupid popup reminding me to add reminders or do something covers my keypad and stays for a long time with no way to close it i can't keep checked off items it reminds me multiple times every couple of seconds to clear off the checked items again blocking me i can't move items between lists and if there is a way it isn't easy enough for me to figure out cumbersome
__label__1 no way to integrate with google assistant on a pixel it's great app by itself but unless developers figure out a way to make this happen this gets one star at the moment todoist has a work around but ultimately im just looking for something that allows me to get thoughts into a task list without needing to search for my phone and get into the app sorry devs
__label__5 best tool for tracking time in my opinion
__label__3 app is easy to use but there are 2 features i find annoying when i add calendar items that i have entered multiple times before i would like the event data to default to the same data usually used for this event even when i'm adding an event for the 50th time i have to overlay the time duration reminder the other is that my reminders don't always remind me take today for example i would like them to keep reminding me until i clear them even if that takes all day
__label__1 awsome application i purched it but i just want notifation should be blinking on phone like alram clock plz add this type of features the thing diplys in notifaction should be flash on main screen from last 10 month it's not getting synchronising plz do something developer we paid for it
__label__4 тарас это крутая идея и хорошая реализация доставляет кайф возможность разбивать дэйлики на подпункты будет чётко если добавишь возможность автозавершения после выполнения всех пунктов система ачивок вполне юзабельно но нужно устанавливать ачивки на habit generate по типу 30 дней без перерыва и при желании по возрастающей 3 месяца и т д nexus 5x lineages os 15 1 не работают reminders не готов брать подписку но если добавишь отдельный платный контент иконки или журнал квестов куплю
__label__4 very nice ui but need some work 1 first week day monday sunday option in calendar 2 calendar should show tasks habits below calendar instead of when touching the selected day only this makes you feel you have nothing the whole day mont add this and app will be more solid and i may jump into premium keep it up
__label__1 ive tried this app 2 times its great but everytime i use it it installs pop up adds all over my phone as soon as i go to open one app their is an add not cool i deleted it for the 3 and final time
__label__3 loved the concept beautiful design and has taken its place on my home screen after a clarification from the dev on syncing other calendars i also love the fact that you can just jump in and use the widget or you can opt for deep customisation of the look feel and functionality
__label__1 do not download this app there are ads everything you use i as of feb 26 2020 despite what the developer says about the 18 hour just read other reviews and you'll see that the intrusive ads have killed this free app look for another similar app
__label__1 reminders are a premium feature are you kidding me this is an absolute deal breaker i deleted after trying for 2 minutes
__label__3 this is my first time rating this app because i noticed that there were changes in putting a reminder hopefully after the task tab the time date will be under it it's a bit hassle that it was made smaller that without my glasses i didn't notice it for several times also i don't see any purpose of sharing it to other people so it should not be the priority i hope that you can do something about this anyway thank you for helping me get through my daily tasks i'll wait for another update
__label__5 it is a nice app thanks authorities for creating this app
__label__5 love this app it works very well and helps me organize my life
__label__4 i liked it but once i got it i saw a had no need for it and i felt like i don't need it as much as others
__label__5 i love this app fyi although it is a free to use app i dont remember seeing a single ad definietely reccomend
__label__2 works well does more than i need a little awkward setting up reminders 4 24 19 update new app update forces me to read how long ago was the task due and then it shows what it is very very annoying will be looking for a new app if they don't fix this 4 30 19 response pop up notifications show how long was the task due then what it is and i mostly read pop up or slide down from the top disabling countdown doesn't solve the problem
__label__4 i think it's a great app and a lot of fun i had some trouble figuring things out at first but everything works the only complaint i would have is the cost it would be nice to have some of the features but they are too expensive
__label__1 very pricey
__label__1 app works but i got very disappointed after i purchased the premium features only to discover that sync between devices doesn't work and that the app developer is completely unresponsive to my support requests so i wasted my money and am not able to get a refund
__label__5 so easy to use really help me who's such an untidy person there's a pomo and really help me to count how much time that i've spent in one session
__label__3 last update is bad its hard to put time for the task i dont why you have updated that i paid for something easy to do why you are making it hard to put a time for the task
__label__4 hi so i was supposed to be rating this perfect but i want this app to be improved because i love it so much it's so small yet compact i love it my problem is it doesn't have a backup option like a sync thing that i can do it on my google account i hope you guys have that option the same with other note apps thanks a lot
__label__3 having some problems figuring out what all this app offers still learning it
__label__5 kiss easiest way to keep on track is to make tracking simple and encouraging it's easy to set up features allow for various forms of success yes no 5x week any days number per day and you get to decide worth a shot you might even adopt that new habit
__label__4
__label__1 i hope the calendar inside can keep the completed to do list history
__label__3 great app but crazy there's no google calendar integration even tried setting this up with zapier but it only creates an entry with no link to any do task title for when the task is created and not when the task is scheduled will google calendar integration be coming to the app
__label__5 awesome not awesome just got a new phone doesn't trasnfer most of my events and tasks this has to improve i love this app enough to take my tune to recreate my events but if this isn't fixed by the time i need a new phone bye bye business calendar and i think i even paid for the upgraded version i see red
__label__3 just downloaded seems to be a simple task to do list that i was looking for question how do i get the app to be an onscreen widget which is shown on the screen shots above thank you
__label__4 it is helpful
__label__3 it could have been a robust app but these bunch of loosers want you to pay every month is annoying
__label__4 easy to use really helps keeping me on top of things
__label__3 great app keeps things organized my request is that changes should be saved automatically rather than having to press save like in google keep i forget to save it before leaving the app usually because i am in a rush and so things don't get updated this feature would help a lot
__label__3 it was working well but after sometime it was experiencing crashes and won't open really disappointed but still i am downloading it again hope it'll not do the same
__label__1 language of the app doesn't change at all places
__label__3 the idea is great but it doesn't help me with my goals the thing is i have to use it on silent and facedown so others notifications and lights don't bother me here lies the problem when the time runs out the app doesn't vibrate cause of that i have to constantly check the hour which is not good at all for me i'm using a galaxy s7 edit see that's the prob i did everything in the answer except turn off the silent mode as i said there's no use for me if i have to do that tks anyway
__label__1 seriously just realised you made duration a premium feature why did people just start using it more all of a sudden
__label__3 coming from wunderlist i am disappointed so much wasted space in the user interface and no way to make elements smaller the overall look is also less slick it really is a to do app while i'm looking for a listing app will have to find an alternative
__label__3 how come you can't rearrange things in all the list
__label__1 this is worst task game in my life
__label__2 cannot sync what is going on
__label__5 amazing tool for time management particularly for people with adhd
__label__3 easy to use but lacks neccessary functionality to make it really useful needs to be able to pull thorough tasks into my day based on 'repeat' and 'due date' rather than having to maually add to my day
__label__4 love it it works i would like to have had it transfer my habits to the new phone but the backup folder didn't work so i had to do them all over again overall love it though
__label__1 can not import wunderlist tasks it simply says gathering info this might take a minute then it looks like there were no new updates since your last import
__label__5 i love it it's perfect i used it in the past and i really like the new aesthetic changes and some additional functions still being an awesome app
__label__3 very interesting concept but it's extremely time consuming to setup and add all the content you need also being able to edit everything and choose the rewards freely kinda looses it's purpose i understand some people might like the feature but i personally do not overall great app if you have the time to set it up and get familiar with it
__label__4 nice app but pls include better sounds
__label__5 i am unable to create a new daily this is the main reason why i downloaded habitica the error message says ' ' is not a valid enum value for path 'frequency' edit the app works perfectly now i've been using it for over 6 months without a single issue this is the best self improvement app ever created
__label__1 i downloaded this after seeing someone advertise it looked cool so i figured try it out right until i downloaded and it prompted me for a subscription lady you are nuts people rather by the paper agenda at the store for cheaper you do not see the full texture of the book it's an online planner on top of it i'm not paying you for that i downloaded a free calendar that does the exact same thing terrible marketing skills
__label__3 a wealth of options and no guidance on how to use them templates or examples would be useful if you're willing to stick with it you'll find it very useful the leaning curve is steeper than it needs to be
__label__3 it's such a spectacular idea but i had trouble figuring out all of the different aspects and it was just too much for putting in tasks on a day to day basis
__label__5 great but i'm on premium and i cant cancel play store not showing subscription either
__label__5 i have searched lots of app for goal planning this one is best of them easy to use
__label__1 purchased the plus version and now with the update to pro i no longer have my premium features
__label__3 wonderful when it works i have written them and never heard back i bought the full version because i really like the calendar i love that i can see many of my monthly entries on the full month widget view i do not love that it crashes a couple times a day and i have to delete and add the widget again especially since it seems to always happen when on in front of someone making an appointment smh please fix update4dev i did not receive email i just resent email which contains info
__label__2 i wish there would be a widget on lockscreen
__label__1 this is just a re skinned samsung calendar don't waste your time
__label__2 it seems like the developer is paying attention to customers which is a good thing hopefully they'll respond to the overwhelmingly critical reviews of the most recent update the checkboxes simply make it too easy to accidentally mark a task as complete this is a bad bad deal i use todoist to help me more efficiently run my businesses if i errantly check off a task it could cost me a lot of money and possibly lose me a client hopefully you'll fix this right away
__label__4 after the latest update when i click the 3 dots at the top right to delete a task i can't pull the menu up to click the delete button
__label__4 nearly the perfect 5 star app but i have just one gripe which is that unlike most reminders apps the due overdue takes don't change colour to make it clear at a glance which of your reminders are for now and which ones are upcoming
__label__3 reminder sometime not working so i must restart the reminder please fix it
__label__3 the concept has had an extremely positive effect on my life however i am experiencing bugs with the widgets where exercises are disappearing restarting hasn't helped
__label__5 perfect it is brilliant for everything i need i have even thrown away my old to do list notepad
__label__5 cute and entertaining definitely helping me to stop bad habits
__label__2 loved this app until it stopped syncing my android app and web app have been out of sync for over 2 weeks
__label__5 great tool for tracking habits simple to use and it does as advertised i like the daily reminders to update the calendar it helped with my motivation to keep up the efforts
__label__3 great app but it never archived old chores so didne let points
__label__5 great task app still don't know how to integrate in to outlook on pc wunderlist had integration
__label__3 its simple but it works
__label__5 great habit tracking app the only things i think could be improved are goal dates not automatically pushing back to match the day you edited a habit and being able to edit how you want to track a habit if you change your mind maybe i missed something but it seems like you have to recreate a habit in order to change how to keep track of it ex yes no or by keeping count with numbers i highly recommend this tool though it's a great place to start keeping track of habits
__label__3 latest update broke google task can not synchronize try to log out and can not add google task again
__label__5 very easy to use and very useful thanks
__label__5 best daily tracker out there very easy to use and good ui lots of customization options download this if you are trying to build up a habit just simply tap on the circle daily to mark it would recommend
"__label__3 it's okay application however it is not that practical reason is more 
often than not i have some event i'd like to add and shift around my 
routine this is not possible at the moment using programmer for 2 out of 
3 days is meticulous just so i can add 1 event it would be good to have 
the ability to move and split routine items with events in essence make 
programmer less of a hustle and more natural and quick to use"
__label__3 it's a very useful app especialy when you are trying to form new habit and you need constant reminded to do that thing but what i hate in this app is y do i need to subscribe it don't make any sense at all
__label__5 e u
__label__3 i can't not choose another calendar besides google calendar to sync with app
__label__3 i was very excited for this app but there are a couple of things that have disappointed me i really need a 24 hours clock i have many events after working hours so as it is now it's useless to me moreover don't know if this is my problem i can't see reminders i see them inside the calendar app but not here hope they will improve so i can finally give a sweet 5 stars the idea itself is brilliant
__label__2 has potential but made no sense i didn't know what the hell i was doing needs more explanation and help
__label__2 the app requires premium membership to use the widget defeats the point for me
__label__1 it have reminders in premium version how it can organize when we can't set reminders
__label__1 worst app for premium only yearly pay of rs 990 no option for monthly payment bad app
__label__1 can't buy pro version on note 9 apparently in app billing is not available on my device guess i can't give you my money
__label__3 i can't type not because of my phone there must be some mistakes
__label__3 love it so far wish it had a widget for android though
__label__5 this app has worked great with no glitches it does exactly what i need it to do and has had a valuable impact on my life one minor update i'd like to see is a way to customise the category titles sometimes the preset ones don't match up with the tasks i do
__label__3 no longer getting reminder pop ups what happened
__label__4 i liked this app very much it helped me schedule my time that happiness didnt last long as it kept shutting down often if that problem is sorted out then this is one of my life saver app thumbs up
__label__5 this amazing app
__label__3 this app is good but i can't access 5 habit because i need premium to access it
__label__3 nice widgets and user interface i really wanted to use this app for the moments daily review but all lists are included in the daily review with no option to hide lists this made the moments feature feel clunky and unusable
__label__1 i used to like this then the updated it to include something called in inbox which is just ruining it for me i dont need that its making it confusing to keep track of things i will be replacing this with another app
__label__4 great addition to having a calendar i can set text reminders for to dos from here so i don't have to clutter my family's digital calendar with details for my days took a while to get how the app and folders work but i have a good system set up now
__label__3 good layout unfortunately doesn't sync with office 365
__label__3 i dont get the point of the game
__label__4 good tool to manage one or more calendars in one view connects to gmail contacts phone google drive and more
__label__4 very nice application
__label__3 needs registration for online use
__label__5 i absolutely adore this app it keeps me from getting overwhelmed but also keeps my house clean because i only take care of what's on my tasks that day
__label__5 fun way to track your chores and get small challenges to get better nice idea good app thumbs up
__label__5 very helpful
__label__2 the new design is atrocious before you could swipe left or right to see coinciding days which made for easy comparisons and changes you can't even scroll back up once the time has passed now its just one long continuous list takes 3 times as long to readjust just terrible 2 stars until a more usable design is reintroduced
__label__4 this app is a bit laggy sometimes but overall i have gotten alot of help from this app especially during my exams it helps you stay focused as the name suggests you have to build a forest and the more focused you are the bigger your forest gets it is a really fun app
__label__1 doesn't look like the pictures at all exact same layout as your phone's calendar now new settings etc waste of time app
__label__1 dear developer i have paid the amount for pro version after deduction still app is not get updated to pro version i have mail you the same issue asked you to look into expecting immediate responce from you
__label__3 really like this app but wish i could see my whole calendar or at least have the option to search for a specific date that would make it perfect as i want to use it as my go to planner
__label__4 this is and exact representation of how a to do app should be i love the widget from which i can add a new task without getting into the app there is no clutter in the interface everything can be accessed from one page
__label__3 this app is great but the setting of the aims and the tasks takes a long period of time therefore it eats up your productivity
__label__2 great app but i constantly have sync issue and that's why i started to use todoist
__label__2 the new widget is not looking good please bring back the old widget or atleast bring an option to make it look like the older version
__label__4 very versatile keeps you on the track and highlights your strengths and weaknesses so impressed that i bought premium on very first day to have unlimited habits 4 stars only because there is no possibility to set monthly repeated task neither on a specific date e g 3th of every month nor on specific day e g second wednesday in a month otherwise it would be 5
__label__3 this app is great as far as the calendar and task functions however it is nearly unbearable to use since it doesn't respect the phone setting to not notify during a call when it notifies during a phone call using the regular carrier app not skype hangouts or other app it buzzes and sends a loud notification that is painful and very disruptive i sent in a support request 3 5 years ago and they said it shouldn't do that and they were going to look into it but they haven't fixed it in any updates and it's been the same on all of the different phones i've had since then not just an isolated issue on one phone
__label__2 i don't like the layout at all i want it to be much more simple and quick to edit my daily tasks
__label__5 very effective
__label__4 great calendar
__label__5 i have been using this for a long time now and it's really useful for me especially when i need reminders to do certain things on a daily basis or weekly though it can get annoying when you're doing something and it pops up but overall it's an app i recommend
__label__4 microsoft version of wunderlist lists can be shared and sync'd between users needs drag and drop feature to allow items in lists to be prioritised based on position
__label__1 unable to manage easily complicated
__label__5 best planner ever bought the pro edition it's easy to use and has many convenient functions like tracking overdue tasks
__label__2 bought premium version didn't get upgrade sent proof of payment still no response not good
__label__5 every day i use it more and in conjunction with the the array of over flowing product offerings vailable my level of appreciation for what i see coming from microsoft going forward continues to deepen hand in hand as my level of understanding in the solutions increase
__label__5 cool planner visualization tool
__label__1 not only is the app bad the second they have your email address they start spamming you response hey doist i have a better idea quit taking people's email information and spamming them without their permission
__label__4 good for studying
__label__5 does what it says and well ave doesn't try to be anything else easy interface to use i have been using this for years and never had any issues and recently upgraded to premium
__label__4 its a good app i honestly dont mind that you need to have premium to get the themes as long as there are no ads im fine i just wish you could create a widget that you can see on your home screen that would be so convenient
__label__3 wish i am not able to edit anything in past for future events if i am crrating any habbit same day onwards i still can able to edit in past events
__label__1 could not even create a account
__label__1 cool idea but it forces you to use google calendar
__label__1 not what i thought it was this only blocks out time for your calendars i was looking for something that would help with daily routines i even tried to use the calendar before giving up but it refused to sync so it's useless
__label__3 the app works with the exception of showing all events on the app the widget show 12 9 hours ahead and 3 hours passed so when one views tomorrow's schedule in the evening the app does not show tomorrow mornings event or anything prior to 3 hours before the current time the next day a bit of a mouthful but those with full schedule will know what i mean
__label__4 it is fun every time i get an egg food potion though i have to drag down the spinning wheel to let it reload
__label__2 app maybe okay but its very confusing to understand i have tried about 30 min to set a simple task for a particular date but it doesnt show up anywhere so i will keep looking for a more simplyfied app sorry
__label__3 can't use it without email
__label__3 app is good but i want to suggest something there should be to do list type of feature that is what sort of things we are doing regularly from our routine will be selected and those which left undone will be not selected in this way more clear picture of time allotment and productivity can be seen
__label__2 its the best callendar ive used but letely its been freezing a lot and its annoying because i use it a lot pls fix the freezing edit 6months have passed and this is still freezing why i use my calendar a lot so i cant keep using this
__label__5 complete with usable widgets
__label__4 easy to use
__label__3 some features are to be paid
__label__5 works good for what i need
__label__2 couldn't exactly figure out how to use it
__label__5 keep improving
__label__3 great app but missing integration with goggle assistant or automatuon apps like ifttt many apps do this now ticktick is falling behind
__label__3 i really have wanted this app to work i'd really prefer to see my day filled on a clock in such a way so i even came back to try again however i'm having trouble putting tasks in after a certain amount they stop saving i'm also struggling to see the clock in a way that makes sense it looks very jumbled best of luck i love the concept
__label__5 i've been using this app for around 3 or 4 years now it really helps to keep myself on track especially because i'm easily get distracted the interface is very simple and easy to use
__label__4 this is a really useful app for managing multiple to do lists
__label__4 its a good app but i dont understand how in the picture they got their timeline like all their routines all my one has is the days of the week and to make a routine you only get two additonal tags im confused how did they get so many
__label__2 hard to use
__label__1 app has no images on s10 and is completely unusuable
__label__3 i miss an option for recurring tasks like do something every 3 days where if i check it a day later that automatically shifts all following tasks by one day
__label__3 it crashes everytime i open it whenever i go one day without using it
__label__5 love it very simple clean interface and satisfying sounds and colors make this app soothing and beneficial to not use
__label__1 should have an option to add reminders it only displays events
__label__1 bad
__label__2 i had to put in all the info
__label__4 a great tool to see what's going on in your day i linked work and personal calendars into one the customisable buttons are a nice touch and allow you to make it work the way you want it to
__label__5 excellent way to gamify life to help motivate
__label__2 here's a tip if i disabled a calendar i shouldn't see it's tab at the bottom of my screen at all times why do i need to see holidays for each account on my phone across the bottom i'll be uninstalling this
__label__4 huge amount of functionality in free version stopped short of 5 because duplicate functionality v limited when i duplicate tasks i cannot duplicate to any other location than current one and cannot change name and the new name is set as old name plus copied would be very helpful to have duplication functionality that i can copy tasks or indeed a whole list and on copying them can have the duplicates placed where i wish and make choice about naming convention
__label__3 good mazeed behtri lai ja sakti hai
__label__3 forced to migrate i'm annoyed that you can't drag and arrange tasks manually if sort by is on i need to be able to arrange tomorrow's tasks in the order i want to do them not whatever order the app decides
__label__5 honestly perfect allows for you to add subtasks to major objectives and is very cross platform compatible
__label__2 not sure why everyone's given this such high reviews the reminders don't work for me which makes the whole point of having this app useless
__label__2 seems to have glitched out on me when i put in my username and display name it gave me an error saying path profile name required then none of the avatar customization options appeared i wasn't even able to start the third page when the app crashed reopening the app took me to the dailies tutorial and now i'm sure i'm missing something i have a samsung galaxy note 10
__label__4 great app only annoying that the mobile and desktop app don't always sync up
__label__1 worked fab until recently then i noticed the time in the centre was an hour wrong although when i went into the app it had the time right so i uninstalled and tried to reinstall but when i tried to put the widget on my home screen it now puts on a blank box that's resizable but invisible otherwise very disappointed
__label__5 no what i mean is in the past it wasnt day 1 instead monday tuesday wednesday and etc but i'm fine with it being this way i can adapt to the problem quickly nice job this apps is worth the price been using it for 2 years
__label__4 beautiful app for personal growthv
"__label__3 best and most effective habit app i've tried however adding new tasks is 
very frustrating because the sorting feature is buggy sometimes the item 
you're moving disappears for a time sometimes the item jumps out of place 
this might sound trivial but i have a lot of tasks and being able to sort 
them is an essential feature for me i'm on android 6 0 lg g4"
__label__2 well based on the description of this app and what i understood i would receive has not lived up to its description i hope the bugs will be worked out i emailed for help more than 24 hours ago and have not received any response thus far it would be helpful to have a help and or faq section to refer to after only one day of using the app i have encountered the following 1 from calendar screen button does not give option for project only event task or note i have the upgraded version 2 settings general start with is set for day view but shows month instead 3 help feedback only gives option to email for help no option to search for help 4 when deleting an item in a series comma i do not get the option to just delete the one occurrence am i doing something wrong is there any help that i can expect to receive i paid 4 99 for the upgraded version and i am not at all happy busy people with crazy schedules need a reliable app
__label__3 i love it but too expensive
__label__3 being a free version user regularly i can boast about todoist's opening yield of tools you receive although they are not much different or more varied than most other task apps what makes todoist stand out is the easy to operate platform the simplicity mixed with the intuitive functionality makes this a hair more effective enjoyable my recommendation for anyone needing some help being more structured it helped me greatly
__label__1 it was alright in the beginning but search bar disappeared after adding my tasks guess there is bug who can't handle long task list not recommending
__label__3 can't find a way for new entries to be added to the top of a list rather than bottom
__label__3 great app but have a few suggestions that would make it the best app in the market trust me people are looking for this 1 the ability to add your schedule with a few clicks for example you can set reoccuring events but peoples schedules alternate would be great to be able to click the days you work group then at the same time and categorize them under work for reference look at the nursegrid app 2 add your spouse or family directly so everything is synced real time familywall
__label__1 the app has been really good these past few months but suddenly everytime i start the timer the app stops responding i don't want to uninstall the app in fear of losing everything i've done on the app but the app hasn't been co operating and i might just be forced to use another app
__label__4 works
__label__3 i am a premium user this is a great to do app tasks habits tags subtasks timer however it lacks things that i use on a daily basis for example integration with google calendar or its own calendar to add events not tasks edo agenda did a great job i wish tags could have different color so that i can distinguish them just by looking at the color i wish it had other features like project column where you can manage a whole project ex trello integration with google assistant etc
__label__2 looks like a copy of an iphone app im not impressed by the huge bar in the bottom or the single colored ui a night mode should come standard
__label__2 otherwise the app is good but i bought the full version and did i exepet to get customization fratures atleast give to feature to mark different sectors with different colours very disappointed you guys should consider making the user interface less complicated
__label__4 amazing app helps me organise different tasks and events with colour codes wish there was a notes page and a timetable so i could keep everything in one place
__label__4 one of the best apps to boost your productivity replete with useful features even in the free version love their habit feature
__label__3 i like that this app notifies you for tasks but it should respect android system's do not disturb i shouldn't be reminded when i sleeping and i explicitly turn off notifications no other app i have notifies me in do not disturb mode
__label__1 developer started to add invasive ads and worst of all the functionality that was working before is not working anymore probably the app is busy with the invasive ad and forgot about the job at hand and yes i know about the payed version
__label__3 the concept is inventive but the execution simply makes this app less than enticing to use
__label__5 love this a simple easy way to keep me on track during the day
__label__2 not working on xperia e1
__label__2 this is exactly the app i was looking for to visual my day as the clock face just makes sense however only being able to add to the schedule via external calendar apps makes this completely unusable i tried to use it to better manage my routine but my calendar app became so full of menial tasks that i was unable to see my upcoming appointments and events of most importance it has amazing potential but is currently only good for basic planning very disappointing
__label__3 super cute and motivating but the server seems to constantly bug out on me
__label__3 the app is really good but after some time it keeps stopping i reinstalled it two times and the third time also the problem persists i was forced to uninstall it finally
__label__2 best to do list app except the new notifications have gone haywire they only pop up at bottom of screen and then disappear if i open any other app old standard android notifications would remain in pull down notification drawer until i dealt with it far superior please bring that back
__label__5 its a beautiful app i loved it just one suggestion when someone calls on whatsapp the tree withers
__label__4 amazing
__label__3 i want to like it but the main thing i wanted it for is location based reminders when adding a location i hit star to save it but they aren't saved you have to manually enter the address every time i don't understand why everyone gets location based notification so wrong
__label__2 it worked for the first week now i can't add a task without it crashing
__label__1 advertising everywhere now so bye bye
__label__5 brilliant app would be great if attachments were supported too but this is the best calendar app by a mile for my many calendars also if you don't like ads buy the bloody thing developers aren't charities and i'm fairly sure you wouldnt do your job for nothing don't be cheap dudes
__label__1 sync isn't working no response to emails no updates for ages
__label__1 absolute rubbish killing off wunderlist for this is a clear example of the domanant power of the big thugs microsoft google amazon etc taking over better competitors so they can push their inferior garbage trying out ticktock now
__label__5 great habit task and to do list tracker
__label__4 i really like this app its a lovely interface simple to use and very useful to have both tasks and notes with the calendar is there any possibility of adding a folder tag category function to the notes it would be so helpful i make notes on a varietu of things as i go along and its really useful to be able to store them by day but it would also be great to be able to sort them by tags or folders anyway just a suggestion otherwise a lovely app thanks
__label__1 nice
__label__4 really helpful app but there's one problem you can leave the app by clicking the home button and your tree keeps growing while you do other stuff on your phone which means it doesn't really prevent you from leaving the app hope this is fixed because i really like this
__label__3 nice app but ux can be improved
__label__1 rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet
__label__4 very helpful and detailed app love it
__label__4 fantastic
__label__5 wow this is so slick has to be the most polished app i have ever used not really surprised as the web windows and ios are all superb as well this is so worth the 4 a month
__label__2 no dark theme without a premium subscription ok
__label__5 very good app
__label__3 it keeps crashing on my phone pleas do something about it
__label__4 hey awesome app it wasn't long until i purchased the unlocked version however some things could be improved for example you can't change units after the habit is created and it would be nice to hide the 0 part after digits since mostly it refers to minutes or iterations or cups and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as learn at least 30 0 minutes or drink at least 2 0 cups if the number is whole why not just hide that point zero it'll look neater i think
__label__3 limited functionality but reliable
__label__2 ui atrocious nothing fits
__label__3 new features update now please
__label__3 it seems so cool and i wanted to use it as soon as possible but it wont even let me log in it takes 1second to load and then nothing happens
__label__3 haven't used it enough to truly rate it but it just seems like there could be some big innovation if you put more thought into it a lot of potential if you ask me though
__label__3 long time wunderlist user here what i feel that can definitely be improved is the snappiness with which each task list opens right now there's always a small loading delay when clicking on a given list
__label__1 needlessly compicated for a to do list app try to add a new item to your list and youll accidentally add a new list try to swipe to switch between lists and youll remove an item from your list what did you just remove hard to say cant seem to find an undo option among the numerous other options
__label__2 the app is very good but for some day when i click on plant the app stops working
__label__5 helps me to stay focused
__label__1 it's not working unfortunately at first it was reflecting then when i added more items it's no longer working it just keeps adding the data in the calendar but no graph is being created
__label__1 free but wants you to pay before using social media not required but wants you to register before using popular company popular enough to remove my last 1 star review and send me an email disputing it plenty of better note taking apps exist i highly advise against this invasive app
__label__4 this app is an awesome and fun to do list i like it a lot and it helps me out with my life and tasks every day however the app crashes whenever i try to sort to dos by scheduled and it's getting a bit frustrating
__label__4 after the latest update the forest has been removed coin count and tree purchase history is up to date but the entire forest is gone synchronization does not fix the issue i did not reinstall app as per the in app warning not to what the hell update after two weeks issue was fixed
__label__5 amazing app very helpful in planning your business very nice feature that you can add something and put it on repeat every day every month certain day highly recommend it will help to make you business and life more easy
__label__5 excellent and detailed beyond average love it
__label__3 be nice to see all tasks by day instead of just 7 days out
__label__5 a great way to work on self improvement with friends hold eachother accountable and have fun
__label__2 mixed great app but don't by premium won't work without play services and developer unresponsive
__label__4 google assistant reminders do not populate will this be addressed soon
__label__3 i'm a premium user and i've bought it for about 3 weeks now however i've realized lately that although the timer records the amount if time i've focused the app doesnt record nor update my data for example in the friends page it always says that i've focused for 0 minutes when in reality it's a couple hundred minutes already please try to fix this problem thank you
__label__2 almost every feature requires a premium account for 36 per year it's not even possible to test these features without subscribing to an annual plan
__label__1 there are more effective and honest ways to turn a buck in the playstore crippling your app with a paywall only drives home just how unnecessary the app is
__label__5 this has really helped me be motivated to get things done im really enjoying this app
__label__2 i liked the app and i purchased it but i can't sync any data from old phone and when logged out of the app there is no way to login again except reinstall the app so if anyone is fine with restart all the progress everytime you change phone this app is for you but since i like to keep my progress to the new phone i am stop using this app and find another one
__label__3 not so easy to figure out i still don't get how to enter achievements in terms of goals such as if i practice 15 mins but the goal was 30 no help in app
__label__5 i've used several task and todo apps this is the best by far
"__label__3 not able to sync with outlook cannot create goals with a goal tracker or 
export calendar events tasks or notes and only accessible through phone 
and tablet much improvements needed for such a high subscription rate"
__label__4 my go to todo list app i'd love for the habits feature to be improved though
__label__3 it's good but app keep crushing after exit from the app and i reenter
__label__5 really good alternative for wunderlist that i wa using before this one have more features and syncs very well for collaborative use
__label__1 too difficult to figure out how to set up can't add times to daily routines this app is a waste of space
__label__5 it's a wonderful app
__label__3 i love the app great concept but the thing is you cant use it or it wont notify you not unless you open the app once you close the background it will lost
__label__4 i tried to download this app but it says not enough space when i download any other app it installs the app immediately i don't understand it
__label__3 nice app but the price scared me
__label__5 fab
__label__3 it's a pity that your tasks become overdue not according to your system time
__label__3 this is a good app to motivate but wished there would be analytics to show progress like graphs etc
__label__5 this is a superb way to motivate yourself to do things to create new and healthy fun habits and get rid of bad habits do you want to live a life full of adventures be creative and install this amazing app i would suggest a clearer and friendlier gui but overall its amazing
__label__5 i cannot recommend this app enough i was looking for something that couldplan my day out and this ticked every box would highly recommend
__label__4 i don't know it works good and i like that you can add notes to the task that is very helpful i just kind of would like to have a better weekly view but all in all it gets the job done
__label__2 this was ok for a few days but now when i open it it is just a blank screen and i have lost all my tasks very annoying as these were important reminders
__label__3 easy to use and keep my tasks in check love that i can have different sub tasks for different projects though i wish they could vbe color coded so as to differentiate them
__label__2 just started using it but so far so good
__label__1 i dont get it in google callender i set a goal to run 4 30 every morning but why on earth is it so that the app sets time on its own and when i edit it it is edited only for one day not the others
__label__5 i have been enjoying this app for a good while over a year now the recent update moved this app from ok useful with some mild frustration to amazing super pleased with this fix
__label__1 this app is not the best
__label__5 great for stalking
__label__3 for basic mode nothing much can set
__label__5 this is a great app it's helped me stay on task with everything i need to get done
__label__2 do not buy premium version app stopped synching 7 27 2019 and is no longer supported i got premium to sync to new phone since i've been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking 10 wasted very disappointing because basic version is great simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits good visuals and the ability to make notes premium tracking 5 habits and syncing across devices but no more would be 4 stars if still supported and worked
__label__4 give more features on par with google keep dark mode too is an essential tool that's sorely missing
__label__5 great app for tracking habits
__label__3 the free app is too limited other than that it's a good one
__label__3 i've just installed this app and will definitely play with it in the next few weeks it really looks nice and really structured so far my only surprise is that there's no female icon for the person only nuns or dancers but not a simple female icon that doesn't do anything just stands hello is this app exclusively for men or is the icon hidden somewhere
__label__4 such a useful app never again will i miss reminders or find it too much hassle to add a task would like to be able to change the default reminder time without having to amend every one and would like to see support for tasks from non exchange accounts e g hotmail etc but even with these unavailable to me the app is still amazing i thoroughly recommend this
__label__4 i use it as an integral part of office365 online services and especially the outlook one note combination as a means of staying on top of tasks within longer term projects i don't find it helpful for short term todo lists and i can't seem to program future tasks to show up in my day but i wouldn't want to be without it
__label__2 the app requires premium membership to use the widget defeats the point for me
__label__3 its ok i've started using it when i found out wunderlist was going to end and be absorbed by microsoft i've used wunderlist for years so its a change what i miss most is being able to manually adjust how my items were arranged i don't care much for alphabetical ordering and going from oldest to newest or newest to oldest as the only other available options are a bit annoying i liked being able to sort my items as needed on the daily but maybe that's just me i love'd my lists and now meh
__label__1 despite having given all the access required it just doesn't work wanted to use the app but just couldn't because the tree doesn't die and it doesn't stop me from using other apps so the purpose is defeated uninstalling sadly
__label__4 reminder doesn't work as per expectations if we set any task with due date and if get completed before due date and try to mark it completed that task get completed but new task get added with same name and same due date till that due date
__label__4 add negative habits which when done decrease coin xp etc
__label__4 easy simple cheerful effective
__label__3 good app but need improvement
__label__1 this is not a multi protocol task manager as the description false implies this is a front end to their service i couldn't get past the first screen because it requires me to set up an account to sync i use a private server capable of syncing things like tasks exchange most public clouds google icloud office365 email providers have this capability therefore why should i need to send my data elsewhere if it's already on a server the fact that data is not something you can touch doesn't make it less valuable be mindful of it it is our most valuable asset today it may not be tangible but it sure can be quantified endlessly requiring signing up for any app is a huge red flag
__label__4 beautiful design but i'd prefer a one time option for the pro version
__label__3 ticktick throws a lot of functions and features into the app almost the whole kitchen sink it has some very good and strong features specially related to reminders recurring reminders some ability to recognise natural language dates etc however it needs to improve much more in search abilites except for tags and list names search terms do not show up as you type search for tasks with multiple word combinations in the task title does not work robust solid search is still sorely lacking
__label__3 i really like this app but i stopped using it because it's too hard to type out my entire routine on the app i wish it was windows compatible
__label__2 loved this app but recently noticed i really was't hearing the audio from notifications and for some unknown reason although the notification volume for the pro version sounds loud at 100 system volume for notifications this version bc2 sounds half as loud if that to the point it's unusable because i rarely hear them update just realized that for some odd reason bc2 calendar notification volume is mapped linked to ringtone volume and i had that lower than half volume please fix this
__label__5 it's easy to use and from all of the habit apps i installed i still came back to this and realize this is my ideal habit app truly love it
__label__2 would agree that it isnt very user friendly functions seem complicated and too basic at the same time
__label__2 easy to use but do not always follow md2 it's damaging our brains
__label__2 i am a premium user and found it very complicated and got many bugs
__label__3 app looks very interesting and the way it is displayed is ibteresting but i am unable to place the widget on screen each time i try to add it to my homescreen it disappears i mean it does bot get placed on my home screen help me with this my phone is one plus 3 with android 7 1 noughat
__label__2 no notification of habit tracks
__label__1 this app is useless it works as a notepad with your tasks in it it does not notify you of tasks you suppose to do when the time reaches it's silent doesn't pop up even though settings have permitted it to pop up and alert even a simple alarm clock notified me of what to do this app doesn't work
__label__4 i like this app alot it lets me track my habits and goals in an intuitive way only would ask a few minor things like a line on the bar chart that shows the limit goal task alarms even when app not active
__label__5 best task app in free version very useful i hope they don't disable options what are now for free
__label__3 great app so long as you only use the free version which only tracks 5 x habits used the free version for a couple of weeks then paid 9 49 for the platinum version so i could sync to other devices really disappointed that the sync option won't work and software support is non existent for an expensive app i would expect the developers to be as helpful as possible when a customer has an issue but they have completely ignored my request for help
__label__2 i like the app except for some reason it now says it doesn't work with my account even though i can use it everywhere else i've done all the it things i can think to do but to no avail guess i'll be looking elsewhere now
__label__3 not really the app that i was looking for but ok
__label__2 despite various updates to fix bugs the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on android the app beyond sign in still functions but that's it the game aspect is weak the app isn't very well designed and the tutorials tend to be broken on android as well i prefer apps like fabulous which i think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way
__label__2 this app was exactly what i was looking for a visual of the day in clock form only issue is if i add something to the clock it adds it to my calendar i don't want that i want an app where the calendar and app are separate this was supposed to be for studying and exercise i didn't want to have to add those things as into my ready packed calendar it was a fast uninstall iif there was an option to disconnect the two i'd reinstall
__label__3 widget transparency please
__label__5 the best yo do list app i like the notification process and style
__label__1 bad the reminders not working many times trouble shooting
__label__2 need to work on it
__label__1 it's not a user friendly app too much complicated usage it's of no use don't have an option of recurring task its not mobile friendly app i prefer not use this app in my life waste of money and i dont know why this one cost is 300 bucks
__label__2 not worth of killing wunderlist some crucial features such as comments are missing in the app
__label__1 sucks
__label__4 i'm not sure but i keep getting these little hidden files in download folder but i believe they're from the calendar i haven't checked since the update but i do use this app every day especially for the widgets and the customization you can get lost in it but i'd rather have the option than not
__label__3 i love the app but its shame that i can't add my tasks on my calendar after i planned my day i am heavy calendar user i use it to schedule every hour of my day but i can't do anything similar with this app except to remind me at certsin time to me having to see how your day is structured by the hours is really usefull uninstalling it for this reason
__label__3 just downloaded this app not sure what i think of it at the moment cant seem to find where you can use colours like the pictures
__label__3 it is a great idea don't get me wrong but why the need for a chat room
__label__5 very helpful
__label__2 using this apps i can guarantee you will never remember one single task needs more improvements to be classified under reminders category
__label__1 does not sync across my devices which it claimed it does only reason i purchased looking for my refund
__label__1 this app used to be good but now the recurring reminder time changes everyday to the time you completed the task
__label__2 good concept but lack basic functionality
__label__1 files lost forver no updates and broken
__label__3 super
__label__5 this app is fantastic i work from home anyway and with the disruption due to the coronavirus it was difficult to maintain my usual schedule by the end of the day i hadn't accomplished much and really didn't know where the time had gone i downloaded sectograph and it has made all the difference i am getting my work done and even have free time to enjoy i even recommended it on twitter yesterday
__label__3 the app is good but the customer support is awful i tried them a few times asking to transfer my premium account i had on iphone to my samsung phone but got no reply whatsoever
__label__1 excellent idea but doesn't really work as intended all i do is use the app when i know i definitely won't need my phone and obviously this isn't what it was designed for i'm not using my phone less at all really the tree's should be continuously planted and then when you use your phone the current tree growing dies as this will put people off using there phone if they see that there is only several minutes left for the current tree to finish growing
__label__1 in this app it is very hard to use
__label__5 wonderful app
__label__3 landscape mode only big problem cant make it portrait on my kindle fire 8
__label__1 wouldn't even let me customize
__label__2 i downloaded the update but still it isnt working i worked for a day and then stopped
__label__3 i love its functionality and the idea behind this but one thing is really missing in my opinion is the import of tasks meetings etc from the mails
__label__4 i love the dynamic add button now that it's finally here in the android version
__label__5 awesome
__label__2 looks really good but i'm not going to pay a subscription for it sorry if you said one off payment then maybe most of the locked features are available in other products out there
"__label__3 there is one problem that not notified me accurate time it's 5 to 10 
minutes after wake me up why i don't know please help me regarding this"
__label__1 kept crashing
__label__2 i found developers lie about free features i just turned into day view i asked to login and then i asked to upgrade in description this option and several other options mentioned as free
__label__2 it was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange and with new update you can't even open the app from the widget you have to create a seperate icon which is super super annoying probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon
__label__5 helps me a lot thank you
__label__3 just add 'to do list' feature highly recommend
__label__1 i paid for habitbull premium for the sync functionality which fully does not work i've tried reinstalling the app reinstalling android getting a new phone no luck emailed habitbull a month ago and still no reply if i want to take a backup i have to screenshot everything not ideal apart from this the app is decent it's got a cute meme
__label__3 very useful but needs dark night mode am sure that aint to hard to create
__label__1 i settled an alarm on this app but it never popped up this looks like a great app but please fix this all my notifications in this app is open
__label__1 synchronization does not work since last update with chrome extension i think in year 2020 when there are services such as firebase this should be normal however it is not
__label__4 i think it's a bit silly that reminders labels are premium features but other than that great app
__label__4 i love what this app is doing and what they are attempting to achieve but at times when i try and double my coins it does not get added to the overall total it's a small thing but i hate watching adds just to not receive the reward
__label__3 does not update tasks in widget automatically
__label__3 ok
__label__3 still trying to figure it all out not tech savvy so what looked very easy at 1st just doesn't seem to be for me still trying tho
__label__3 it's a good app but it keeps crashing when i use the app after a week's time it doesn't open i've had to reinstall it multiple times please fix it
__label__5 i like this a lot ive been searching for this kinda app for so longggg
__label__1 scheduling reminder intervals does not work
__label__5 would pay for this if there were even more additions and updates absolutely love it and wish they would develop it even further
__label__3 i cannot re edit the date like i used to in the last update please fix it i want to edit it from the text box not from the calender
__label__3 the app itself is pretty good my issue came from having difficulties canceling my subscription i described everything i was doing to try to do it what i was seeing instead of the option to unsubscribe etc the solution suggested did not help so i described the situation further the next response came from a different person who suggested a method i had already mentioned was not working for me after i replied again i never got another response i just figured out what the issue was but i couldn't do so before getting charged again disappointed in the customer service
__label__5 a great way to set reminders for birthdays or any type of event
__label__2 i am a paid user of this app i like this app a lot until android 10 they claim what they used to do is not possible but that is not true because another app i use daylio has a nice notification that jumps out at you like any do used to now any do gives a regular ignorable notification which you click and the app does something on the screen and is pretty pathetic then it gives it's notification to plan your day so it's two clicks with a big visual pause in between not cool
__label__2 not a single event appointment meeting etc is showing up going to uninstall after rating
__label__1 limiting sections is ridiculous so if you want to add things for 30 days you need to have seperate projects
__label__5 a super quick response from the dev sorted out my issue with the alarm sound so now this little app is perfect for me you can sort your tasks into lists you can be reminded by notification or alarm any amount of time beforehand you can set a priority for tasks and probably more that i haven't discovered yet now i just need a busier life
__label__3 good app for task but should be linked with reminders
__label__5 love this app the basic version is fine but i love being able to add even more items in the paid version keeps me on track all day
__label__1 absolutely hated it it was just weird
__label__3 i downloaded this app because the other app i was using wouldn't always notify me also they recently decided to change from an analog clock face to having to scroll similar to a digital clock to set the due time i tested this app before i started copying all my tasks but i came across a problem when creating a repeat there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month ie the 3rd saturday of the month or the last sunday of the month this is a big issue for me because i have certain things i want to do but it's not always on the same date of the month hopefully this can be added changed soon
__label__3 not happy having flashing ads at the bottom of the calendar very distracting
__label__2 i started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times so just removed them and no longer use biggest feature i would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the today option for the task list widget sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when i can complete all my tasks the next day the list doesn't refresh still says all tasks are done
__label__5 great app to keep your timing steady
__label__2 i think this app is the best option for a to do list except that the sync is terrible i just paid for premium and the app will not sync during the trial the sync between android app and pc app was also very bad if they could get the connection sync issues fixed it would be a great app if i can't access the premium features i paid for in the next few hours i'm going to be requesting a refund
__label__3 i love this app however i sent the link to several friends and they got the app and i received no premium time whatsoever don't be dishonest with your apps that's lame
__label__1 how can one trust an app that is supposed 2 help organize when u misspell organize
__label__5 really useful and easy to use would be great if you could attach pictures to the notes section
__label__5 love the app great replacement for the dying wunderlist
__label__3 i love this ap but when the new update went through i no longer have the pro version please fix
__label__5 i'm liking it so far it's actually motivating me a bit will update review with time
__label__3 first i was using this app but when i downloaded it after a long time then strange problems occured such as the routines remainder are not coming although it's option is on also when i login back then a caption stating no authorisation provided to app is flashed please tell me how to resolve it
__label__3 there were a lot less options for handwriting covers and stickers than i anticipated for something you want me to pay an annual or monthly subscription for it's a great concept but the execution fell short for me
__label__1 i paid for premium when transitioning to a new phone and my history was transferred i recently had to un re install the app for personal reasons and it does not recognise my account anymore creator contact has not responded to numerous courteous emails extremely disappointed wish i could get 3 years of data back i loved the app and the app itself is 5 stars but will only rate 1 due to reasons above would change to 5 stars if resolved
__label__5 i love it but needs more ready tasks and a rank to make more competitive and share tasks
__label__5 great app very user friendly and practical thanks
__label__5 i love how i can keep track how long i focus and on what it's also really rewarding to see your forest grow
__label__5 awesome
__label__4 pretty good so i can set my life straight on my daily good habits and positive impacts of my self motivation
__label__2 switching from one list to another stinks otherwise helpful
__label__3 it's good for me
__label__1 best among productivity i am going to buy full version soon but it worked for 2 days and then it crashes on opening sent two mail to your team regarding this but haven't received any update i have tried everything whether on internet or on your twitter response i am planning to purchase this app but it's not doing well i reinstalled almost 3 times but same worked for 1 day and again same problem model no cph1859 phone oppo realme 1
__label__4 this app is really very useful but it would be better with a feature that import the routines created to other calendar apps through gmail or some sort as for laptop uses other than that it is awesome would definitely recommend to my friends keep it up
__label__3 good but repeat mode is not working properly i am looking for some other app
__label__5 loved how everything is that u offer now and loved the themes backgrounds and also that u can change the colors i love pink i changed it to that i will recommend this apo to other's hope u stay forever this is the best app of the to do ever and the only one i use and will ever use
__label__1 че то вступительного туториала не достаточно чтобы понять что делать
__label__3 the app is ok it could be simpler to work i had to fiddle around a bit and some persons may not have the patience to do so
__label__5 it's a very good planner app i had scoured the play store for dozens of planner apps but none of their free versions were worth my time this free version is entirely great on it's own and without any ads however if you're a student as i am the duration feature for tasks on the premium app is definitely worth the 2 99 a month
__label__4 não tem a opçāo de sub tarefa
__label__4 this was a very useful app to make me stop using my gadgets but right now i tried to download it but i can't i think its because my tablet is not android 7 and up can you please support those gadgets if this is the problem i really want to use it again
__label__4 nice
__label__3 good would like for completed tasks to automatically move to the bottom
__label__5 this is an amazing app i used to struggle to get anything done before i stumbled upon this wonderful creation
__label__3 the app is good but ive few complains sometimes i need to use the web browser but i cant open it since it would wither my tree so thats a hassle and also make 1 tree for one hour
__label__3 quite boring app and can't add subtasks
__label__3 i don't understand why the changes i make in this app don't sync with google calendar what am i missing
__label__4 it is an extraordinarily designed app however the subscription price is high please reduce the price so that more more people can enroll please add the option to have end time for each task i mean the from and to time for each task also the unfinished tasks of yesterday can automatically come to today since tasks showing in yesterday's list does not make sense reducing one star for this once these changes are done i will surely re rate as 5 stars thanks you guys rock
__label__4 very good
__label__1 i cannot even create an account i fill in what's needed and i'm pressing the button and it's not working some1 help
__label__4 good
__label__3 fantastic idea i've actively been seeking something just like this for a long time but the app itself is super glitchy most things wont load and everything keeps resetting it might be my connection or my phone i'm not sure hoping i can figure it out cause i love this
__label__3 time zones not supported missed a meeting today
__label__3 can't set times for when tasks need to be completed can't tick off tasks for the next day
__label__3 i like this app but it's so buggy it has a lot of throttling while using calendar sync please fix this a i tried to log out and reconnect this doesn't work calendar part is still buggy the calendar only works well when i turn sync or calendar permission off but i can't see calendar events in this case
__label__1 app install page says nothing about it being a free trial for 2 weeks so you have to pay to use this app this is not disclosed on the app page from which you initiate install
__label__4 love the layout and automatic carryover of tasks to next day one problem i have installed planner pro on my ipad and my android phone the calendar events and tasks cannot be synced between my two devices very frustrated please add this sync feature soon
__label__5 it sometimes crashes a lot
__label__5 this is the perfect calendar app and its gorgeous to boot
__label__4 i really loved this app it has everything i wanted but i feel like there is still room for improvement in this app it's my personal opinion though it will be better if you could add a screen for the heat map and that heat map would be colored on the days when user did at least one task another one could be letting user add notes for subtasks also
__label__3 love the experience will give 5 starts when there wont be any subscription for pro features one time purchse is what will make this app perfect
__label__1 sometimes app keeps on crashing and i have to reinstall to get it back
__label__2 after all this time you still can not search tasks on android so you have to look through every task you have created and through each list to find what task you are looking for going down to 2 star
__label__2 i liked the app notifications when they worked gotta pay 2 99 a month crazy mbe a year not a month for a calendar app most widget features wont work unless u pay never got to see if they even were worth 299 a month i like the popup reminders hopefully someome will make a free one
__label__5 excellent app tried everything and this is the best all around productivity app out there well worth the premium upgrade
__label__2 i'm changing the rating into two stars because the sync feature which previously work fine has no longer work looking at the last update i feel like the developer had abandoned this apps which is quite sad considering this usef to be the best apps on building habit
__label__1 app looks good but does not notify me on my oppo i foloowed the instructions to fix this however they are outdated so i cannot fix this problem
__label__3 good app but sends too many notifications
__label__1 i couldn't even log in
__label__4 very helpful the best yet
__label__4 could you kindly add a weekly timetable looking kind of view
__label__5 it's a great little app the free version allows you to put in up to 5 habits you can customize the colors and order and you can see your progress i like it
__label__3 have to go premium to have more features
__label__2 this app doesn't show all the activities of my google calender so to me the app is quite useless i even checked all the available calendars to make sure the settings were right however the concept seems to be great for people with a busy agenda but since it has no use i unfortunately had to delete this app
__label__4 this productivity app is amazing for anyone looking to gamify their life i've been using this for about half a year and it's made a difference in motivating me to be productive the app can act up sometimes however with it syncing my activities properly but other than that this app is great
__label__1 if you want to use dark mode you'll have to but premium i understand the need to make money off your app but thats just scummy
__label__5 contnuously improving and yet very good since the beginning very clear ui and design easy to use great job
__label__2 probably none better can do a thousand things but developer forces you to always think birthdays and you can't disable tasks either if i don't want those functions then don't force it
__label__2 would've been 5 stars but the new full size ads make efficiency impossible those kind of ads are fine when you're playing other games but stopping what i'm doing in a completely un related app is unacceptable i understand the banner ads to keep it running but the full page delayed ads pushed it too far
__label__3 一 f厂了 b可cncc rv
__label__5 love this app very easy to use and has a great system of organizing tasks also the reminders are very helpful basically vital to my college experience
__label__3 pretty app and probably useful too i just don't like having to create calendar entries i thought tasks would be managed within the app
__label__2 widget does not sync refresh properly went back to wunderlist until at least the widget refresh sync issue is solved using android phone tablet and windows 10 the following items which are present in wunderlist should definitely be integrated 1 the option to choose that starred items be moved to top 2 the option to choose that new tasks be added to top 3 folder view in the widget 4 icons under a task on the widget showing that a task has subtasks and or notes in it
__label__3 great concept and very well executed but the app doesn't close correctly and leaves its loading screen open over my home screen so i can't use my phone until i reset
__label__1 it won't allow you to create an account with e mail address and password why give you the option but then doesn't work when you use it if not resolved within a week uninstalling app
__label__5 the best app in the world
__label__4 i would like to set the begin date in the past then indicate the total number of days and have app calculate end date i would like to see the end date on calendar number of days remaining and an option to have days marked complete as the default also stop asking me to rate when i already have please
__label__1 very confusing navigation
__label__3 love the app and bought the full version in february but recently it quit syncing between my phone and my tablet i emailed support about the issue on june 2 the tasks are syncing now but calendar items still are not syncing wish they would fix the issue
__label__3 i would really like to see the inbox feature in wunderlist brought over there is currently no efficient way to quickly add tasks so you can sort organize them later on the main page there is only an add list button and i don't want to add everything to my day this gets cluttered and messy it would also be nice if tasks that you have assigned for a certain day are automatically added to my day instead of having to go through and look for tasks that are due and add them to my day manually
__label__4 playstore info says in app purchases i'm on premium longtime app widgets for gmail calendar filters labels shorthand for dates recurring etc so flexible discipline required to set your own process helpful examples and tutorials on their website i do outlines for book project trips recipes attach files i prefer web app on my chromebook then this app on mobile beware app is addictive wanted print as outline tasks dated comments
__label__3 the app is very good but it keep crashing from time to time and i have to reinstall the app please look into this
__label__1 dependant on another calendar app why why do i need to have another app to use this app i can't add plans or schedule without this app throwing the task to google calendar besides i don't use g c anymore since i once missed an event which i put a reminder through the g c app because it never reminded me i read one comment for this app that it never gave a reminder for a scheduled task and yes i have an idea why it happened
__label__1 bestapp ever super useful the only reason for the bad review is because i already paid for the pro version of this app because it's that useful but it's very disappointing this app is not supported by my google watch its not compatible with my ax armani connected smart watch please fix it would be very useful to see my appointments and errands displayed on my watch without having to open my phone to view than thanks alot i'll removed the bad feed back onces its fixed 5 stars
__label__5 extremely useful once you get a hang of how it works
__label__5 has helped me to stay engaged with my to dos in a workable and fun way love this app
__label__4 almost perfect the only changes that would be helpful is a quicker way to switch from the week view to the task list and i would like to see my tasks as a list by default instead of clicking on the task categories also i wish that you had a rollover option for tasks i have yet to find an app that had this basically i wish when i create a task i could choose if the task carries forward to the next day if not completed or not
__label__5 so far great for me
__label__4 a bit inconvenient interface when adding and asigning date to the task other than that pretty cool intuitive ui along with minimalistic style my first choice of todo app even free version is good enough to keep your plans out of your head but in this app
__label__3 when you start to reschedule things the interface is very awkward moving times around for example moving everything forward or backward on the schedule is very un intuitive
__label__5 awesome easy to use
__label__2 downloaded for the widgets you gotta pay for the widgets before even seeing if they work
__label__4 to do list
__label__1 stupid app even a reminder which is pretty much basic is under premium useless don't waste time in exploring this just go to any other nice applications
"__label__3 i've been using loop but got a little frustrated with it because of a 
couple of glitches the free version of habitbull only lets you track 5 
habits and has a complex format i like the layout of loop much better and 
will be sticking with it despite the few problems"
__label__5 engaging and effective it doesn't seem to be possible to use a google play balance to pay for gems though
__label__3 be better with text slightly smaller as a simple list takes up more than a full screen
__label__2 new great concept but not for confidential data because it's not encrypted nor pw protected on phone or pc and one day any do company will get hacked all your stuff be be out there like equifax resolved app loses your work eg i created a new task started a notes section pasted it in some material and clicked save then i went to another app to get more material but when i returned to any do my notes were gone your save button is fraudulent if it does not save when clicked
__label__2 i regret buying this app tl dr don't use this app if you ever intend on changing routines or planning changing existing routines is very hard as it simply deletes whatever overlaps in time so unnecessary and impossible to revert if you accidentally click pm instead of am once your whole day is deleted permanently also every time i want to sync between my phone and my tablet i have to export it to google drive and then import it from the other device also you can't copy items or days to another time please make this app more user friendly
__label__2 how to do so the link is not opening only
__label__2 unable to create an account despite using email or social media account can't even start trying out the app
__label__2 i got no notification
__label__3 i would've liked to use this app but sadly it doesn't seem to recognize european daylight saving time i've gone through the settings twice this is a deal breaker i'm afraid i would still recommend people try the app however if the live in location where dst is rightfully ignored the main concept is really clever and the widget is beautifully designed
__label__5 very nice app
__label__1 awful graphics idea ia great but the graphics need a major update can't tell the different between anything in this game overall disappointed
__label__1 a reminder app that does not remind set several reminders and none alerted when the time is due previous versions worked great until lately new version 5 0 i've tried locking the apps turn off battery optimization etc nothing worked
__label__2 cool concept but an app like this requires too much focus of its own which only pulls attention away from your intended project maybe it would be better with a more comprehensive tutorial but i doubt it i prefer something straightforward like screen time
__label__5 i love this app it has helped me get organized and remember important things in a way that is so simple and easy i have one request can the developers make a widget for the lists so i can swipe easily to it on my home screen thanks
__label__5 probably the best app for routine day planners this also have text play voice
__label__3 i really like this app though i've only used it a week i have some suggestions though when i add a habit i'd like to add it for the week but not weekends in daily tasks i can the same task more than once which is a bit like cheating maybe add a pop up message that says you've already done that today
__label__2 this has the beginnings of a great app but lots more work still needs to be done
__label__5 works great
__label__3 two pricy
__label__3 amazing app i love the concept of combining productivity and rewards together the feeling of satisfaction and joy is just thrilling after your time is up and you successfully planted a cute tree only thing that isn't working for me is that the page for buying trees isn't loading i can't see the trees i want to buy and there's an error whenever i want to buy a sound to sum it up i can't buy trees or sounds please fix this bug as i want to unlock more trees
__label__1 not user friendly at all they definitely need to work on the user experience
__label__5 really great it is clear effective i can create my own projects and follow them it shows me tasks from yesterday that i forgot to do and so forth
__label__4 hello i love the app as the tree is cute and creative however my tree doesn't die when i press the homescreen button for forest it doesn't die when i leave the app and go to another app what i want is the tree to die when i leave the app so that i can increase my focus and productivity in doing work help please
__label__2 i just noticed that notifications for yesterday's reminder disappear that is really bad wunderlist didn't have this bug
__label__5 it has been six months since my purchase of pro version of this app and i am writing this review as gratitude to the developers though many of my favorite features have been added to default google calender app this one still is my default the diversity and configurability of widgets has been of particular help to me in managing my personal and professional tasks another feature that i had used extensively is feature of repeated tasks that have helped me in forming few good habits
__label__4 this app is great but i have a problem the timeline after a while says this app has been blocked by your system and its gives two options 1 troubleshoot and 2 refresh background task this ptoblem is occuring every time the troubleshoot isnt helping me i have a vivo phone please help
__label__1 trash app this is a great example of microsoft buys companies and gutting their usefulness overloaded with features that are unreliable and useless
__label__3 great idea and everything looks good but the top and bottom buttons are covered by navigation bar on the pixel 3 xl making it unusable couldn't even click the button to report the bug within the app so i'll change my rating once this is fixed
__label__2 came over from wunderlist its good that you guys have synced my lists here however i have many shared to do lists with comments i don't see any comment feature in msft to do when can this feature be expected will increase rating once this feature is introduced
__label__2 hate subscription uninstalled
__label__1 i have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly i am connected to the internet i am a premium user the app is great but please help me with my problem i'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error
__label__4 it's generally good but screen rotation doesn't work so i can't use this app upside down in galaxy tab10 if this problem isn't solved i won't pay for the next year it would be great if this problem is solved
__label__1 not close to do list all features available bin premium mode only
__label__1 i recently switched over from the original business calendar app which i have been using for many years this version has a fancier ui but functionally seems much the same as far as the calendar goes which is fine if it ain't broke don't fix it i think other features have been added but i don't really use them update full screen ads suck they appear and cannot be closed for a long time show me an ad if you must but let me close it the free version is unusable this
__label__3 note 10 plus buffering issues timeline feature and the coin sign cause the app to go into buffer mode so those features eventually are unavailable
__label__5 nice one
__label__4 i really like this app and ised to love it until there was an update that was stopping me from using it without upgrading if i had to pay a one time purchase thats one thing but an annual fee give me a break 5 for a planner app is reasonable if you use it all of the time but not every year yall are greedy
__label__3 good app but needs to add daily to do list
__label__3 overall it's a good task management i like its pomo timer and habit tracker cons 1 attachment day free version that's too little please be kind and add more because of that i have to use google keeps
__label__4 great app i would rate it a 5 but there's an error where my completed tasks becomes unchecked constantly causing it to keep on becoming an unfinished task and it's annoying
__label__4 my own structuring of little tasks and routines improves with this app i really like the app but i would also like it on my laptop it would be great if you developed an option to install and use it on both devices as i don't always have my phone on me while working or did i miss something it doesn't allow me to install the app on my laptop it only shows that it is already installed on my phone looking forward to your response thanks in advance
__label__5 has been using for 6 years now thumbs up
__label__4 go overall application i wish it was easier to make changes in already established recurring appointments and it would be nice to have a refresh button everything else works really well
__label__2 i don't get a single notification the calendar doesn't work well
__label__5 excellent app
__label__1 the fact that you have to pay so much to use something so simple isn't worth it to me there are free apps of similar functionality
__label__2 unable to edit time for reminder s7
__label__1 full screen ads ruin it all i've been using this since it was just business calendar it was still 7 back then so i wouldn't buy it but would click the ads every now and then now with the full screen ads it's practically unusable also before the dev comes in with the stock the free version has ads response no duh it has ads we didn't pay for the app because its upfront cost is too high so we liked the corner ads now you force them to take over our screens uninstalled and 1 star
__label__4 works well
__label__4 awesome app love the prize feature i would give 5 stars if these two issues were solved 1 app does not notify me about dailies even though i set a reminder for 7 45am 2 one of my hobbies that can be checked as both positive and negative stays green forever after checking once does not refresh at night is that how its supposed to be
__label__2 wear os app only supports adding tasks not viewing existing ones without reminders
__label__3 smooth interface but i didnt see where i can set a specific notification per schedule on my calender it has one sound for all notifications in the calender
__label__4 another important feature missing is the ability to tell if i have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar currently the calander view shows days in a circle please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day this is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on on top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task that is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one
__label__5 good game like real game
__label__4 helpfull apps but it would be great if there is search feature
__label__3 i thought it was a really good app until today it started to crush and i couldn't do anything to backup i lost all of my options to do lists achievements don't know what should i do really disappointed auto back up should be offline too and must be selected when we start to use app or you should use your own database system to backup files not dropbox
__label__1 wow what a truly appauling downgrade from wunderlist cant give same top access to users doesnt update well i hate it and will look for an alternative
__label__3 will update down the road
__label__1 it took me a while to login because of terrible security checking and after it suggested to migrate all the data from wunderlist without option to cancel terrible beginning
__label__5 very good app in our life
__label__4 this is a very helpful and fun way to get yourself in the habit of doing things the daily tasks are a fantastic way to get your daily stuff handled and check them off within the app you've got the ability to create to do lists with due dates and notification reminders can make it ridiculously simple to get even the most complex task completed on top of all this seeing your character earn experience new items and getting pets and mounts turns all the monotony into a wickedly awesome rpg
__label__4 have been using this now for over a year after trying a few it is absolutely the best all depends what you need it to do but it has great options and flexibility works just fine i do have a slow to load glitch on the widget on the phone other than that it's great
__label__4 perfect except for one thing the 'i want to ' button at the bottom of my to do list sometimes blocks the bottom item on my list making it more difficult to cross off there is already an add item button on each list category so i think it should be removed or users should be given an option to remove it
__label__2 i love the idea but it's not working on my samsung s10e like the main screen is just purple when i first open and then the features for designing my character didn't show any options i'll happily try again once bugs are worked out keep us posted
__label__2 it does not ync eith al the calendars
__label__5 it's weird like i didn't even open the app but the fact they answer criticism and try to improve based on what's here is just the type i want
__label__4 love the way it can be easily zoomed for both size and number of days
__label__1 some thing is comming in front if screen and interepting app is not runs in notification bar
__label__2 i loved this planner for several years with no issues all of a sudden i can't launch the app or create edit an event without getting a noisy intrusive pop up ads i will be looking for a new option possibly even just my stock calendar
__label__3 amazing and helpful
__label__1 it keeps showing java lang runtimeexception unable to start receiver com ticktick task activity widget appwidgetscrollable java lang nullpointerexception attempt to invoke virtual method 'boolean java lang boolean booleanvalue ' on a null object reference at android app activitythread handlereceiver activitythread java 3421 at android app activitythread access 1300 activitythread java 200 at android app activitythread h handlemessage activitythread java 1684 at android os handler dis
__label__2 i like the way it's present itself but advantage if your not getting any notification ring in the system i allowed everything i needed too but still it's not working out
__label__3 i don't friggin know yet i just installed it note i haven't spent any time on it
__label__5 usefull
__label__2 i just bought the pro version great app but some menus fail to load achievements store and so on just load continously fixing this would be great i reinstalled the app but it did nothing also random menus sometimes fail to open completely
__label__3 good idea but glitches eg i incorrectly logged a day as performing a habit and could not change the fact i had actually broken the chain
__label__5 great app as i can have a record of habits i want to instill in my self and daily tasks that need to be done
__label__4 overall good and works well syncs with google calendar and is a little easier to work with
__label__3 i had several recurring events to keep track of my week but after the update they disappeared
__label__3 why we can't sync sharepoint task list with this or any other task management app
__label__1 the app will put by default new tasks into inbox but inbox is not what you see when opening todoist instead you might see that there are no tasks for the next 7 days there's no logic in it app's assistant integrated with google assistant fails to find any tasks even if asked specifically about those in inbox todoist is cumbersome and annoying it's actually a general problem with task apps they're too much and fail to actually do what they are made for
__label__5 i like being able to look at my goals each day review how i am doing focus in the most important one for this month i'm seeing improvement
__label__3 for 2 6 1 timetune background task error keep persists due to screen is off battery saver powered off you can also add new features refresh background tasks when accessing app toggle switch it refreshes everytime when they accessing the app even background tasks blocked by system
__label__5 been using habitica for a few months tried a few other to do list games none of them beats habitica best way to keep track of daily life and still have fun
__label__5 amazing
__label__5 it's very good works on mobile and pc and it's easy to organize you're able to nest lists and it's easy to move them between lists or between different days several different options for viewing your tasks by category by priority or by day or week
__label__3 i like how minimalistic the app is it's very easy to use and has just the necessary features my biggest complaint is that i can't set a custom due date whenever i tap the due date i get predefined reminder and i can't seem to change it no matter what i'm using an lg q7 plus don't know if it's a bug with the device or what will update the score if this issue ever gets fixed
__label__5 cool app
__label__4 do you miss astrid get this
__label__4 this is actually a really good app i just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1 to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2 a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying
__label__2 due date is wonky i made a few items on my list and the due will not change from the current day the due date worked on other items i don't need another app to work around
__label__2 i dont like that it requires you to login why cant i just use it without logging in my accounts
__label__3 i cannot get the widget i designed to show up on the screen i went through the faq with no success i have a galaxy s8 plus with android 7
__label__2 it works but way too expense and compkicated than most user will need this free version has too many pieces missing and is just frustrating
__label__3 nice app but doesn't really have what i'm looking for
__label__2 great idea in principle but it's so hard to work out what's going on that that so far it's useless
__label__2 i would give this app 5 stars but if you press silence notifications you can never turn them back on
__label__3 if you want something that syncs to your calendar you are in luck it really is beautiful and such a wonderful idea however my 3 star review comes from the fact you can't use it without syncing to your calendar and there by having it affect your calendar i was hoping to use this as an hourly time management tool much like a block system but i can't have it be that and have my calendar be a place for just appointments it makes the actual calendar look too full and messy basically in short can you please add an offline tool as well
__label__3 updated it's widget can switch between calander todolist and view the events for the calander in the widget when clicking instead of it opening the calander app like most apps it's task list doesn't seem to sync to gtasks but the calander does upgrade to premium to add things like a recurring event daily planner whatsapp reminders extra colors etc
__label__5 i love it help me organiza my plans
__label__4 this is the best reminders app that i've come across and i've tried a few it falls short of 5 stars as there are some simple usability changes they could make which would make the experience a little bit better it doesn't feel like many updates are being made though
__label__2 the widget has been broken for the last couple of weeks since an update please fix it
__label__2 the only reason i had premium was because i could get sms notifications while still be offline and not worry about unreliable push notifications beats the purpose of having an additional app now than the default calendar
__label__3 works well until you purchase pro after this all your calendar dates are displayed one day ahead your events on a monday in your calendar are displayed on sunday
__label__4 great
__label__3 edit you have to buy the pro version if you want to sync your calendar which to me is an essential component of a time planning app
__label__4 i couldn't change the language of this software i tried it again and again but the language didn't change
__label__3 i love the design and the app in general i would give it 5 stars if it would allow to size the image and the information displayed
__label__3 good
__label__4 great app i just wish there was a way to keep track of time on a task habbit built in timer instead of having to open an external timer
__label__3 this is a great app but i purchased it to be able to use it with my samsung gear s3 little did i know that i can't use it with my watch bc this app was made to be used with android wear which i found out later my bad so will you be working on making this app compatible with samsung gear that would open your market quite a lot with samsung gear users i've been using the wearable app with my watch but it doesn't work smoothly at all please work on that if you can thanks
__label__1 a nice little app liked most aspects of it but had to uninstall because of just one feature reminder i dont know why would someone decide to ship this very basic feature as a premium one if an app like this reminds me after two days in an email that i have overdue tasks than there is absolutely no purpose of using such an app
__label__3 good but the widget glitches out atleast once a month and doesn't display the task list if that's resolved i could surely give it 5 stars
__label__4 switched to using this few weeks back after reading positive reviews as replacement for wunderlist much better than android equivalents but ability to plan 'my tomorrow' would be really helpful as i like to plan evening before
__label__2 i did like it until you updated and took the good features away lame
__label__5 excellent app it has everything i need to manage my time
__label__5 this is a perfect app solution for as a hybrid between digital and paper calendars i love the extras to make is like my paper calendar in visual effects i also enjoy the ability to combine multiple digital calendars into one this is perfect
__label__3 overall great app but it never gives me notifications so it kind of defeats the purpose of having it
__label__2 tried it out the time function which is 90 of the app imho is clunky the default end time is until next activity but then it automatically changes to the start time of the next activity and you can't change it back then if you add a task that overlaps other start times it deletes the other activities i spent 15 minutes setting up a schedule and was frustrated to find that i had erased my entire afternoon schedule because i made a mistake when changing the end time of something mid day this app was for me ironically a waste of time
__label__5 house
__label__3 it's not syncing right with my gmail my recurring events are all messed up but are right on my gmail deciding whether to keep it or not
__label__2 i hated the pop up ads
__label__1 the reason i am giving this 1 star is because of its unreliability i purchased this app for my android phone and my mac desktop it is very frustrating that the same app on my mac is not updating with my phone this app is absolutely useless to me when i cannot see events that i have put in in real time even after i refreshing the app very disappointing and kinda pissed off that i paid good money for this app
__label__3 i liked a lot about this app but unfortunately there is no feature to repeat tasks hourly daily weekly etc which is kinda vital for me without it i can't recommend this app much as i hate todoist's subscription model they seem to be the leader as of right now
__label__3 the fact there are no predefined tasks makes it super hard to use or rather this will work if user can just define the task quest easily or maybe we can import by purchasing some set of quests for me it is still quite confusing and hard to manage with all the options offered would be use it furthere more if not too complicated
__label__2 can't post to my google calendar or any other subscribed calendars disappointed because this app has promise
__label__2 waste of money and they won't let you delete the account i am very unhappy sorry just venting because i don't have all that much of social life
__label__4 it's great the only issue i'm having is when i snooze something and it then occurs at the same time as another event they appear to get grouped together and i have to snooze or dismiss them both
__label__2 i'm changing my rating from 5 to 2 i've used this app for many years and i love it it's a great app but they have recently added add on videos skippable but still 5 seconds long after you've created or closed an event in your calendar app it's really annoying and disgusting because you don't have time watching adds when you want to add a couple of events everyday in you schedule you've went to far business calendar 2
__label__3 not bad but not great pros 3rd party calendar sync time line view icons colour options to customise cons can't sync devices no task list or tick box more options needed such as daily time line view font size highlight current day editing isn't easy i think the whole app including widget could have a neater tidier look overall it's not very intuitive needs more options flexibity it has some way to go i've got premium btw
__label__1 lousy app
__label__4 great app would love customizable notifications and icons that being said of course this is a hobby project just being wishful meant no offense i'd love to reach out it's always nice to get in touch with a fellow developer
__label__5 fits my needs almost exactly
__label__4 better to have a search option for notes
__label__4 love using this but i just wish i could customize the widget more like the opacity and such to make it fit my phone's theme more i have the premium version
__label__5 it's a great app thank you for publishing it for free
__label__1 this was originally a 5 star app but now you can only use it by allowing it access to either your emails or facebook i am definitely not happy to allow this so have deleted the app would give it zero stars if i could
__label__3 app is ok but you can't delete habits and replace with new what the f
__label__2 good ideas but not well implemented it gets tedious and boring after a while
__label__1 half of stuff is paid reminder is something basic with notes if this is not free whats use of app
__label__4 this app looks great and most of the functions seem to be very practical there isn't any windows or browser based version for usage on a computer is it if not is something in planning as wunderlist will be shut down i'm in search for a good alternative and this app with a sync function would be amazing edit showing the calendar view in a widget would be fantastic as well
__label__4 not very intuitive sometimes but a useful app i use daily
__label__3 the app is useful on the phone and tablet i purchased it believing that it would also work on my smartwatch as displayed in the pictures you will only get reminders not a watch face the picture of the smartwatch is misleading either develop the watch face app or remove the picture of it
__label__4 good
__label__5 great game
__label__1 doesn't have a built in backup and even after exporting a backup file an error shows up additionally the support email is an invalid email address a total waist of time for setting it
__label__3 you cant set reminders without paying what is the point of an electronic to do list if you cant be reminded to do your tasts
__label__5 perfect simply perfect this app flawless i give 5 stars to this amazing app it is so simple yet advanced and so adjustable to your terms and conditions i love this app and i am never going back to any other schedule
__label__3 it is good but not for me
__label__2 unable to log in unable to create a new account or link to facebook
__label__3 pretty good app but nothing crazy that i can't achieve with google calendars already if there is i'm not in need for the feature atm i've really been looking for the feature to set a reoccurring remind with a full custom option for say repeat every 43 days or repeat 3 months then 4 months then 3 then 4 etc this sorts of features would be amazingly handy as you would then not have to set up a new reminder for each date after having worked them out manually if you add this feature please lmk
__label__3 this app works nice if you want to track daily or weekly tasks but it was impossible for me to schedule tasks that should happen at a certain interval for example every two weeks or every 5th of the month there is the option to schedule a task a certain amount of times per month but not to set specific intervals or dates for such occurrences this was unfortunately a dealbreaker
__label__3 ok but need to improve
__label__4 first of all very nice app i do however have one problem and a suggestion the filtered list can you add conditions based on how frequently the tasks are repeated i really want to see my tasks filtered to today tomorrow and weekly task lists hoping for your feedback z
__label__3 the ui is neat with pleasing graphics it is straightforward to use no frills i just wish it can accomodate 6 people and the notes feature is available to use it is a premium feature but it would be nice if there is a character limit as a compromise the app supports syncing with calendars but imo a todoist calendar option will be better no added step of linking and maintaining the other calendar's data integrity all in all this is an app with potential
__label__3 still trying to learn how to use the app i'm going to go on youtube for some help
__label__1 does not integrate month calendar view and 24hrs view within the circular widget graphics it only shows 24hrs 12hrs in free version very restrictive the widget shows full info for one day and no info ahead unless you select a different day for the days ahead you need to leave the widget and work in a different environment why complicate your life find a calendar app you like stay with it come back to sectograph when and if the widget fully implements time and task management
__label__5 honestly great simple effective 1 time purchase the ui has a sort of dated look but it's very quick and easy to use most of my daily habits vary alot based on which day it is my schedule varies so much i cant put them on a specifik time and i almost always do them in the same order therefore there should be an option to change the order of the habits manually yourself without any variables
__label__4 nice
"__label__3 love the interface great smartwatch integration but cant change the color 
palette for some reason tried reinstalling and resetting app no luck"
__label__3 i've only started using this this morning so far i'm hoping it helps with motivating me to accomplish things it's definitely a great idea i kind of am wishing the was done sort of story line to follow along with like ones you have so many days of completing so many habits you get a clue to find whatever your quest goal is or something like that would make it more exciting i'll update my review once i'm a week or 2 in
__label__4 please make an option to use the old style widget unfortunartely letters became too small for 4x6 home screen grid
__label__2 selecting text to copy cut or delete also selects many previous lines of text this is the only app that does this it makes selecting text harder than it is everywhere else buy it if you use it a lot you either have to decrease your number of lists or pay for it they do have phenomenal customer service and continued development of the app
__label__3 i wish the clock looked simpler the point of downloading the app was to be able to see what my day is like just by looking at it once the sectors should be more defined
__label__3 there's a very important feature missing to select and edit multiple tasks at once also the app could improve speed wise it feels a little slow and heavy specially with the transition animations otherwise 5 stars
__label__2 i love the idea but it's not working on my samsung s10e like the main screen is just purple when i first open and then the features for designing my character didn't show any options i'll happily try again once bugs are worked out keep us posted
__label__2 too complicated to save and add
__label__4 this is a great app for me the app is easy to navigate and the motivational quotes are a nice touch i give this app 4 stars because i have an issue with the notifications i want the app to remind me to do a certain task a certain amount of times throughout the day but it only sends me the notification once i open the app which defeats the purpose of the notification not sure if i'm the only experiencing this problem other than that i use this app on the daily
__label__4 good performance so far
"__label__2 doesn't work on my asus zenfone 5 ze620kl it doesn't show up whenever i 
add the widget in my home screen"
__label__1 doesn't save my timeline have to redo my while schedule now
__label__5 simple and to the point
__label__4 very good been using for a few years now the synch function is temperamental lately perhaps an update changed something
__label__1 i purchsed for one month and try to integrate with whatsapp its not working at all and even not able to click resend for otp
__label__5 love it
__label__3 overall i love this app and find it very useful my main issue is sometimes my reminders don't pop up which is kind of irritating considering i use it to remember my birth control when it doesn't remind me i'll often completely forget to take it or remember a few hours after when i'm supposed to take it like i said love this app and use it to track when i go to the gym or remembering my pills just wish my reminders would work
__label__3 after unlocking the tree with sufficient coins the tree is not changing and irt remains fixed in green colour
__label__5 genial aplicacion
__label__5 nice
__label__2 the program is very good on my old phone galaxy note 4 but notifications don't work on the new one redmi note 8 pro i hope you will fix them thanks
__label__2 list feature sucks i don't need to manage myself so i can't speak to that functionality i just wanted a list app preferably one that worked with google assistant although that feature works great the list feature kind of sucks in an attempt to look new and edgy the user experience went down the drain i found it clunky irritating i shouldn't have to add a new item to the grocery list just to be able to uncheck items i need again and that's just one of many irritations anylist baby
__label__2 i downloaded and paid for this app several days ago it has some good aspects but now i literally hate some other aspects of it for example if you set a specific time for a specific time e g 1 3 pm it disapears without giving you a chance to do anything with it so if you didn't finish that task you are out of luck if you want to move it to somewhere else how ridiculous it is i'm really scared i can't trust this tool i have to switch to something else and cut my losses
__label__3 i've been using this app for a long time and i love it however recently it has been weirdly buggy and my trees die from things like samsung health as well as snapchat notifications even when i don't even look at them the notifications kill the tree
__label__5 perfect i'm loving every element so far i love that i can at some point once it's all done use it like my paper planner and sync them with my phone i hate carrying my paper planner and also having to update my cell calendar i love and cant wait to see and use all the coming soons i'm so excited i'm hoping also a widget will be something to come soon as well so that i can have it open on my phone and not always have to open the app for quick reference keep it up
__label__3 wouldn't it be great if this app had also alerts instead of just notifications it's easy to miss a notofication also why can't we edit a specific day for a repeated event but we have to edit also all future events or nothing
__label__2 used to be good until last update now i can't login to see any of my tasks appointments or notes edit now works since newest update but i have lost all previous tasks and notes very disappointed
__label__2 free app is crippled version of paid app costs 4 99 a year
__label__1 how to restore my pro version
__label__3 the app again crashed after updating its not even responding
__label__5 this is great for studying it's a fun insensive to turn your phone off it has really helped with online school in isolation
__label__5 nice
__label__5 i like this a lot i'm getting my friends to use it with me
__label__3 like the app so far but i went into the settings and changed the appearance of my standard view to month yet everytime i open the app the standard view shows day instead of month
__label__2 i tried it years ago and never really got it going then i switched to wunderlist and became an organized machine now wunderlist is being retired so i thought i'd try again guessing it would be much better by now and that my ability to use it to my advantage would be vastly improved nope no ability for folders or some other way to group lists together so i don't have to flip through all my lists to find the one i want not even a list view to make them easier to find
__label__1 useless
__label__4 awesome upgrade from wunderlist i couldn't expect i can live without wunderlist i just give it a try and now i don't regret for it truly a great successor of wunderlist but if u can please make the font size customization option it will be really helpful
__label__2 glitches galore currently am unable to see certain options at all as they are blacked out tried deleting re installing resetting phone changing the theme to different colors it's a shame because this is my favorite to do app was just thinking about biting the bullet upgrading if fixed will definitely reconsider
__label__3 it's a good app no question about it but it's not perfect i used it for months after abandoning todoist but i'm leaving ticktick now it's feature packed but not as polished as other products the ui is not great and the app has very different design language as well as features depending on which device you open it on this lack of consistency as well as poor natural language support doesn't make it the perfect todo app
__label__2 interesting concept but i get a path type is required error all the time so i stopped using it
__label__3 easy to use
__label__1 uninstalled not at all what i thought it was this entire app is basically just a fancy way to look at the calendars you already have everything syncs both ways so if you add your actually daily schedule minute by minute to this app you are also cluttering up your calendar s with the same things would've been neat if it actually had some kind of function but i don't need to waste sd card space on a calendar viewing app
__label__5 very useful app how do i get the notifications to disappear automatically once they pop up i don't want to stay clear them every time thank you
__label__1 difficult to understand bit complicated
__label__5 so helpful great way to keep track of tasks notes info and appointments appreciate the cross platform functionality
__label__3 we would like it more if there was a way to not see explicit messages on how well people are doing opened up by my 8yo caused some conversations we'd have preferred not to have at grammas so looking for a app we like as much for ease of use and that we can control the explicit messages had to delete off of her phone and will probably be following her
__label__4 great to do app
__label__1 too many ads and it doesn't automatically save your work also everytime i exit and reopen it it brings me to a different page than i was on
__label__3 nice app will suggest some changes after some time
__label__5 its a great todo app have assistant integration make it awesome if you can please add telegram bot and ifttt
__label__5 best calendar app i've come across
__label__2 great app but deleted it because i don't like the new santa hat icon edit added a star because they replied and reverted the icon
__label__3 i have the pro version its almost perfect but there needs to be an automatic option for a tree to automatically start planting at a certain time for someone with distraction issues like me the notifications aren't enough and they're inconsistent
__label__1 paid for premium so i could sync between devices but it doesn't work and customer service will not respond to my inquiries
__label__1 it's not good for you when u r busy self distancing lmfao
__label__3 nice but no daily notification come
__label__3 habit widgets stopped working after a day they just go blank and don't ever come back the widgets where my favorite part of this app so that's too bad
__label__5 absolutely amazing app the best for to do lists
__label__2 great app with one major flaw when entering addresses and selecting from the drop down options the house disappears and leaves only the street city and state without the actual house or business number this is a huge problem for me
__label__4 wunderlist being killed by microsoft seems like most people are coming to this app instead of moving to the recommended microsoft to do giving this a try
__label__5 it is easy quick and intuitive
__label__4 solid free app being locked out of extra functionality with a paywall is a little irksome but nothing i can't got over it does what i need it to
__label__4 amazingly good experience that lets you manage and plan your days ahead and let's you take some time for yourself out of the haphazard schedule
__label__4 great updates nice color nice experience pro version is better wished more was free need quick add tasks see tick tick needs folders and a pomo timer would be awesome thanks for adding sort and categories
__label__4 does what i need it to do
__label__4 it's a good assistant for daily life but i don't like that in there's a premium upgrade for money
__label__3 you have to select for a reminder that should be standard
__label__3 i love this app i would really love an option to check off or mark that a task was complete
__label__3 you can have just 5 habits for free we should have more
__label__2 i have used this app for a few years and loved but what have they done with the app the major update in december has made adding moving tasks harder thus makes me less productive edit to answer can't always change projects with a simple the gui is cluttered with too much going on when i tap on a task i used to tap out but when i do it comes out of edit mode goes to the top and i have to back out again to get to list view
__label__5 great app it's exactly what i've been looking for
__label__2 i used to really love this app as it provides a todo list widget that can show a lot of todo list items compacted into a very small space however it has started showing full screen ads when adding new items so i'm going to be looking for a replacement
__label__5 this is by far the best overall organizer app i have found my only complaint would be the lack of multi tiered tasks
__label__4 jibj
__label__3 the app looks great alot of function it wouldn't show me any shared calenders fix that and this is a top app
__label__5 absolutely love the app first ever 5 star rating and we'll deserved i was looking for a widget that gave me the weekly schedule and this was spot on no issues whatsoever so far and the ui is user friendly too 10 10 would recommend
__label__3 cant postpone a task the reminder you set was invalid because its already overdue thats the reason im postponing it
__label__1 after signing in i get random notifications telling me things i absolutely do not care about i haven't even added any tasks and it's already telling me to join groups and blah blah blah no thank you
__label__3 the reminder option is not working i have paid for premium to use the app to its full potential but unfortunately the basic feature of the app to remind you to stick to your schedule with respect to habits you creat dosent work kindly help by resolving this issue color code options are limited that can be assigmed to the newly added habit
__label__3 does it not have feature to set reminder daily weekly monthly and yearly
__label__4 it's helpful but it's also annoying edit i didn't make it clear enough it's annoying to realize how much i'm failing lol anyway the app is pretty good i'm just overly sensitive and self criritcal
__label__1 awful hard to start impossible to figure out
__label__1 app hasnt synced in 190 days won't let me log out still loads all my old data from last sync hasnt been updated since 2018 that should be the best clue dont buy
__label__3 great format and tracking 7 seems excessive for upgrade feature to use as a widget also people have a form of spirituality rather than a religion can that not be reflected in the app too for inclusivity removing forum comments would be a great option an unnecessary distraction
__label__5 helped me out alot
__label__1 don't offer to send notifications if you won't actually do it that was the whole reason why i thought this would help me and it didn't will be uninstalling
__label__1 unskippable video ads pop up when you are adding or editing an event i mean video ads popping up in a calendar app is bush league already but unskippable may as well have a boxing glove on a spring pop out of my phone and smash my groin that's probably preferable
__label__3 no sound in reminders just vibration how can i fix it
__label__2 55 o
__label__3 reminders should be available for all
__label__2 alarm not working so no time strict
__label__5 wow i tried many apps like this and in my experience this app is the best one so easy to use after other apps with too many options and not understandable design this app is perfect you just click ' ' and enter the name that's all of course if you want you can add time and date and something else i recommend
__label__3 this application is good in a way that you can prioritize and organize your tasks the thing is that the important features such as the 'alarm' for notification of reminders and sharing of documents are only allowed in premium package and as a student i would not be able to avail these features monthly i wish that you can add a feature wherein you can personalize your notes so it will be more fun and exciting to use
__label__2 too much spam stuff that i don't care for pops up on my screen all the time and blocking those also blocked the reminders i wanted the app for also too many emails i don't want more clutter to organize my life
__label__4 pretty great app motivates me to do stuff i normally wouldn't want to because of the prospect of leveling up one small gripe i have is that if something with a reminder is marked complete before the reminder goes off it still reminds you even though you've already done it also sounds when you mark something etc come out the ringtone channel not the media channel
__label__5 l'm the 6'000'th comment
__label__1 i lost all of my notes and it wouldn't accept my passcode to get in any more so i deleted it and installed it again then logged in and all of my stuff was gone please help i need it back
__label__3 everything is perfect its just that the completed tasks are too faded to be visible in the widget kindly fix this i am deducting 2 stars for this problem
__label__3 there's a lot to be improved hope this app to get better with the time
__label__4 good app
__label__4 the app is real comfortable for use the only thing i can't understand is how to view the events you create from the calendar icon top left
__label__5 wunderlist app is now going away so when i received their email notification i started to look for an app that is equal or better with what i currently use fortunately there is this tasks that is a great app easy to use so helpful with the sublist has different colors for management and the reminder list can be set to your own time preference thank you mr stephen nottage
__label__3 widget not working
__label__3 has any do changed the way moment works five stars for me until recently and not sure if it's associated with change to android 10 or a change with the app i used to have moment pop up daily i no longer get moment nor continued pop up on screen reminders for tasks throughout the day just looking for clarification that these are no longer features in the non paid version
__label__3 does the month view as per the professional design image exist this seems ideal but i csnt find it
__label__5 worth paying for premium
__label__4 great concept has me waking up on schedule and doing my tasks so i dont loose life and earn exp just one thing i cant do quests i got the dust bunnies quest but i have no clue what to do with it help
__label__3 recently the app has shown a bug in repeat appointments i always have repeated 3 day appointment for friday saturday and sunday it starts in the evening of friday and ends next sat morning saturday evening to next sunday morning and sunday evening to next monday morning after monday the appointment repeats every 5 weeks it used to work correctly until mid 2018 now the sunday evening to next monday morning appointment appears in the week before the correct week please fix it thanks
__label__3 great
__label__4 beautifully done love the features
__label__5 it's a beautiful digital calendar that u can customize with a cover and stickers and fonts so much prettier than the standard calendar that comes on your phone
__label__2 boxes are too wide on the widget it was better on wunderlust as i could see a lot more at once
__label__5 10 10 great app let's you keep track of goals and habits daily it's highly customizable and will send you notifications to remind you of stuff if you want also i really like the message boards i find them really inspirational also i've been using this app for several months and it's never asked me to pay anything and there aren't any ads either i know that there's a premium version in one of the side menus but i'm not sure what it does because it already gives you everything you want
__label__1 keeps crashing pathetic
__label__3 its okay for a plan in a phone
__label__3 the app keeps freezing on the tasks screen
__label__5 extremely helpful for me great app
__label__5 easy to use and customize
__label__2 couldn't exactly figure out how to use it
__label__1 its not working properly
__label__3 no snooze option for reminders this causes some task misses please look at the app to do reminder with alarm for reminder buzz types and options it would be good if these features are added in future
__label__1 bought the paid version the app fails to get data from anything except gmail good concept but lacks in across provider connectivity
__label__5 i like it but i want little more in this aap like with point make hero upgrade more facility
__label__4 so far it's pretty good i've been using it about a week sometimes it doesn't refresh but the other users on the app seem positive and friendly there is a lot that i am learning through users that isn't actually explained in the app like if you don't do all your daily tasks the whole party takes damage so yeah no pressure it would be nice for a better help options or a more detailed in app fist time training learning session every 'first' should option for more info
__label__4 after purchasing the pro version and having used this calendar app for almost 2 to 3 years now i have grown to truly love it it mimicks as close to the franklin covey planner's to any app out there i have found and this is what has drawn me to it i am increasing my rating to 4 stars because i have really had time to utilize all aspects of this calendar and i love that it will sink with my google calendar and other calendars i love this app i only wish it could print
__label__2 this is literally just another calendar app misleading calling it a planner smh it's not even a good calendar if you're hunting for a good planning app keep looking because this is definitely not it
__label__4 it's absolutely amazing and helps me organize my life the features are great and customizable i personally love the fact you can have more than one routine it makes it simple to switch my reminders when i have different scheduled weeks
__label__3 this app is missing subtasks and obviously no prioritizing subtasks when subtasks are added if they ever are please make with all the primary task options and a next action option
__label__1 never seen a worse app than this one seriously i am just wondering how it got 4 6 rating on average you plant 5 grass blades in the name of trees one can't connect to friends and has to wait for hours like seriously wish i could lessen this one star to a 0 01 oh really then why you rob people telling them about features in pro version if it is only supposed to stop us from using phone
__label__4 works as advertised now it's up to you to finish it
__label__3 super cute and motivating but the server seems to constantly bug out on me
__label__3 still missing some things from wunderlist notably email reminders which i really miss not always convenient to get reminders on my phone or install the app everywhere email item to inbox better sorting and as an added improvement please remember sorting by folder and add new task at top of list a bit early to be claiming you can now do everything you could as clearly you can't but hopefully getting there
__label__3 it is a fine app
__label__3 the fact that the app does not let you use other studying apps that you have on your phone or google to find information is a bit annoying currently the only way to get around this is to collect all the information you need before turning on the app but that opens you up to distractions and wasting time i feel like this app is specifically designed for reading purposes only since i can sometimes finish homework before the timer runs out but the only way to stop the app is to kill the tree
__label__1 a nice little app liked most aspects of it but had to uninstall because of just one feature reminder i dont know why would someone decide to ship this very basic feature as a premium one if an app like this reminds me after two days in an email that i have overdue tasks than there is absolutely no purpose of using such an app
__label__3 i prefer to use apps in portrait mode on my 7 inch phone tablet huawei mediapad x2 1920 1200 when the keyboard pops up while adding a task i can barely see what i'm typing because the screen height is greatly reduced in landscape
__label__1 i can't download this app
__label__4 very useful syncs with calendar and lets you easily see upcoming events and tasks
__label__4 i like it it's quite easy to use would it be possible to sync data between devices that would be a lovely plus
__label__5 advanced yet simple love it has all the little features you need without the unnecessary complication alarms sidenotes ability to highlight some tasks organize tasks in order u want
__label__3 pomdoro is bad
__label__3 frustrating update plans
__label__3 no colour for text which may help to quick seperation of various tasks at least there shoild be option of colour n font size for list name very big draw back is when we make a new task we can not add description we have to save it and then by editing add description why the description is not incuded while adding new task recd your reply if i need to disable quick add what is the use of quick add function then
__label__4 how do i put on homescreen
__label__4 would give 5 stars if it wasn't buggy and didn't cause me to miss a task the calendar widget is a complete failure it randomly removes some of the calendars that are synced and creates a duplicate of repeated tasks when they are marked as complete the whole reason i subscribed to this app was because i needed to sync all my calendars and make my life easier by maintaining them all in one place and not miss any appointments or tasks the app is useless if i can't rely on it to display and sync correctly fix the bugs and i'll reinstall and change to 5 stars
__label__1 wow the latest update killed my productivity is the multi select coming back why remove features this app is garbage now and it used to be so great edit the ability to multi select is there you just have to do extra steps and ignore the common recommended android app design of long pressing to select
__label__3 this app is good however the reason i need a calendar app is to share it with someone else and this app doesn't seem to have a shared calendar function which is a shame because it's a really decent app
__label__2 doesn't sync reliably and that's one of the most critical features for a calendar app
__label__1 edit reply from developer says sorry if they offended my feelings really this isn't a dispute about feelings to suggest such is a fallacy personal attacks are not welcome when discussing dislike of your pay model original everything is extra 24h mode colors any default functionality will cost you more bad model because they can add and remove features and make you pay again or more let us pay once for the app instead of you being sneaky and greedy
__label__4 it been running kind of slow when you're making new tasks
__label__2 reminders are invisible
__label__3 with the latest update it seems that when i update the frequency for one task it messes up the frequency and repeat days of the week for another task which is annoying as i was using the app to track my weekly tasks
__label__1 bought the pro version amount got deducted and programer version became accessible but after sometime its showing that i have to buy the pro version again kindly troubleshoot this problem
__label__3 bought the pro a few years ago however recently went to a new phone and now i'm seeing ads and it doesnt look like i have the pro version anymore not sure what happened but jacked up that i paid for the pro and unable to get the functionality of the pro version without buying it again
__label__4 good
__label__1 note to self the demo version of this app is totally useless so there is no way of knowing if this product will be able to meet my needs before paying for the premium version i'll find another way to get my needs met i'm sure there are other products available for free that would do the same things since i'm not allowed to testdrive all the bells and whistles i am passing this app over no thanks uninstalling
__label__5 best habit app ever join a party for accountability partners and better experience
__label__1 the reminders don't work no noise no vibration i even bought premium to see if that would help no luck if i wanted a place to just mark my progress i'd keep an excel spreadsheet
__label__2 this is far from what wunderlist made us use it you no longer have details section in a task where for example you could add a link to a picture or describe more the task in hand it seems it tried to be more of a daily scheduler than what actually the amazing wunderlist was
__label__1 i'm sure the dev is well intended just no for me ux is terrible
__label__4 it really is worth it to download this app thank you for designing this wonderful app thnks so much
__label__2 it was working fine until recently i bought new bush but when i have successfully planted it told me it was successful i saw it planted the last tree i had chosen on previous study session and 4 out of 7 trees were dead even tho it said i planted 7 successful trees the notification also doesn't work
__label__3 i really love this app with my busy schedule it's so great to have all my day's events plotted out in one great visual but it drains my battery like crazy i've lost 10 just typing this out i have to un install it please find a way to fix this so i can re install
__label__1 reminders are not showing notifications for the past 1 week to me sir
__label__2 subscription required just to set a reminder
__label__5 very motivational
__label__3 app is awesome n also helps alot but its inbuilt password once forgot don't opens the app evertime i need to log out and again log in it plz solve my issue
__label__2 first thanks to the forestapp team for making this brilliant app second in iran we cannot pay for the pro version please find a solution to this problem
__label__3 it's almost perfect the widgets on homescreen need more options a list of events for the day instead of only the monthly view is a necessity add it and i'm sold
__label__5 has motivated me kept me productive and is continuing to do so for probably more than a year now makes work more satsifying to complete and the party system is very helpful as well
__label__2 after the last update i had to clear the cache data clear the cache partition then lose all my events to stop the double notifications reminders this has been a great app for many years and this is the first time i've had trouble with it it was a pain to go through all that to fix it but that's how much i like this app i have a galaxy s9 with latest io update update no matter how i set my reminders the maximum i could get it to alert was two i gave up went back to bc pro ugh
__label__5 aplikacja godna polecenia naprawdę pomaga odstawić telefon na dany czas i skoncentrować się na czynności jaką wykonujemy polecam
__label__1 loved it until they added cartoon ads you'll be with a client and a video game comes up as you're scheduling their appointment makes us look very unprofessional
__label__2 i cannot log into the application somehow please help me
__label__3 definitely there is something broken regarding notifications i'm not getting alerts for all my tasks with reminders also seems like notifications unlock my phone and turn my screen on when previously they didn't it's still the app that best suits my needs and definitely worth trying if you haven't before but the recent issues are frustrating but i'm sure the guys will fix them soon thanks
__label__3 great app but it keeps deleting the events birthdays etc that i put in it i've never had this problem before please do something this is my go to calendar app and i'd hate to have to find a different one
__label__4 i really like this app especially the routines i've given this 4 stars and will change to 5 stars once there is better online sync a web interface and a way to sync with google calendar also tablet adaptation would be good this app has a lot of potential
__label__2 liked the prioritization by dragging and the highlighting but there does not seem to be a way to create recurring tasks that's a deal breaker for me i'm uninstalling
__label__5 i bought this great app just started using it i am a procrastinator so i am struggling to meet my goals i am therefore absolutely relying on this app to help me track my performance i really like the notifications with the positive words it attributes to me i like the fact that you can quantify exactly the number or time allocated to the habits and track against that when i manage to conquer a habit i will write a new review cheers
__label__3 need notes option like wunderlist has get that and you'll get a 5 star i have the premium version and we want notes aswell as the chat please just like wunderlist
__label__2 has potential but you gotta pay
__label__1 too complicated when putting on data i'll stay with my diary
__label__1 this was originally a 5 star app but now you can only use it by allowing it access to either your emails or facebook i am definitely not happy to allow this so have deleted the app would give it zero stars if i could
__label__4 good app lots of customization but i have noticed an issue with repeating sub tasks if a subtask is set to repeat it won't complete the main task seems to complete fine if the subtasks are not set repeat
__label__2 when my phone is in tablet mode android 7 the app will not display in portrait mode it defaults to landscape mode pls fix and i'll change my review
"__label__3 nearly perfect in terms of design usability the overall concept and user 
experience matches what i need i would rate it four stars if sync to 
cloud other devices was added and five stars if sharing collaboration was 
possible"
__label__1 i love this app but why does the timer not seem to support landscape mode give stars otherwise
__label__3 while it's actually increased my productivity it would sometimes just crash for no reason killing the tree this is honestly pretty annoying my device is a samsung galaxy note 4
__label__2 reminders should not be transfered in event section it was better before to figure out events and remiders separatly
__label__3 notification is not of up to my expectation need to keep on reminding us until we check or tick it besides that the way of organizing the tasks and prioritizing them are perfect i do love to continue using it if they update the notification part
__label__4 it's a good app it's pretty minimalist and works really well it just really bothers me that the undo button that appears when you make a change gets in the way of adding a new task and gets accidentally clicked so i have to wait for it to go away i would suggest for the developers to please take a look and see if you can adjust the placement of the buttons in this case thanks
__label__2 i liked the app until it told me i could only have 5 goals
__label__3 doesn't save habit data when you switch to a new phone even using the same login information won't let me choose a start date for my habit either so it never shows 100 success like it should
__label__1 used this app for years but i can not tolerate the recent full page video ads that pop up after every calendar entry i use the free version which i know is sponsored by ad the recent updates allow intrusive excess ads that you can even skip and i can't renter the app to verify my calendar entry was added modified corrected the developer or owner has really overstepped with the recent updates and ads i'm going back to the free google app instead i hope you push out a new update before y
__label__5 perfect app
__label__3 i really like this application very well done my reason for 3 and not 5stars is the lack of any security no option for fingerprint or pin before viewing what could be sensitive personal information please add security
__label__1 bought the premium version couldn't access my 100 habits emailed team took many emails for them to address problem asked to redownload app all data deleted problem was never solved more emails to get money back told that they are a small team worst experience with any app i've ever bought
__label__3 good
__label__1 an average task manager that asks 16gbp for the annual subscription no thanks and there are better free and paid alternatives that are better organised
__label__2 premium version only
__label__3 i miss the today week all shortcuts that wunderlist had at the top the planned replacement is not as easy to view or follow my week ahead at a glance the automated transfer seems to have worked well so far update sharing lists previously shared with my wife now creates a double so that needs to be fixed asap wunderlist would randomly delete scheduled reminders in bulk hopefully to do has put a stop to that
__label__3 36 for premium and they won't even respond to my email for technical help whatever i figured it out good app no help
__label__3 the game is very buggy i just bought a reward then the app crashed and the gold i've spent is gone but i didn't receive the reward these kind of experiences unfortunately decrease the gaming fun tremendously and it could be such a good game otherwise
__label__1 removed support for google drive backups
__label__5 i like the clear unclutter look everything is organized wished i could export it without having to pay extra
__label__4 i wish there was a task manager only reason for 1 star drop otherwise this app is working great for me
__label__1 after a recent update it puts my phone on do not disturb and i have to manually turn it off after using forest
__label__5 great habit task and to do list tracker
__label__4 this is what i have been finding
__label__1 i deleted the app but it is still charging my paypal account no one is responding to my messages at customer service please stop charging my account
__label__3 needs a lot more sophistication
__label__4 it is a cool app but the calendar feature required to be bought that should be informed to the users before installation in addition it would be a good idea if skills can increase over time and skills can decrease characteristics
__label__2 completed subtasks are now forced below uncompleted ones and hidden by default i thought that was a bug regression but apparently it's by design subscription cancelled for now
__label__5 very helpful to be mindful of areas you want to change and feels rewarding as you see streaks of success it is easy to use it's design allows you to take baby steps towards more ambitious goals also setup manages your goals so they are realistically obtainable reminders setup is very flexible so notifications are useful and welcome great user friendly design which is highly customizable
__label__2 i'm facing a problem that is reminders are not working properly device lenovo k3 note android 6 0
__label__3 i really like this app makes life more fun foy adhd brain but sound making ads are a real pain i'm okay with the ads in general they don't pop up often enough to be annoying but can we get rid of the ones that make sound so i can stop embarrassing myself in a quiet class room after checking off an assignment
__label__5 why did you change the chat order now the newest messages are at the bottom it just feels so unnatural it was fine before it didn't need a change
__label__4 treating activities like a game gives me a sense of accomplishment when i successfully finish my duties and earn xp
"__label__3 i like the idea especially the differentiation between dailies habits 
and to dos but i need to be able to see the history uninstalled will 
stick to daylio for now"
__label__4 great app please add the ability to see when recurring habit is due or by automatically completing a habit which is not due i e required once a week for example
__label__5 the best yet
__label__3 i like this app very much because it's fairly easy to use and it allows for actual ring tones to be used not just notification tones however my biggest issues are that i cannot receive any notifications from the planner if the event was created on my phone's calendar i'm assuming this is the issue since only half or less than half of my total events and tasks do not sound it also will not sound when i have reminders set for many different times it's original default reminder is 15 minutes before the event time but i changed it to be on time and then i would make other reminders if need be it will only sound at 15 minutes before the event time no matter what i tell it to do
__label__1 force feeds users with video ads after each entry
__label__1 the pop up advertisements make the free version impossible to use i will be forced to change to a different app after years of use
__label__5 this is everything i ever wanted out of a app without all the headaches and frustration and learning curve if could have built an app for this project for work you would have been this exact same app i always of some grand idea of what i want and can never find something quite right and end up very disappointed it becomes too difficult to figure out how to use the program or its just too simple and not professional enough you nailed it with this app and made excel look just silly
__label__3 don't know why but weather shown is for 750 miles away for a region i've never been and can't find a way to adjust it also can't use google tasks not as useful as i'd hoped
__label__5 it's a good app help us in day the day
__label__5 being able to set a task's date time or project name by just typing is game changing
__label__1 would love this to work it says it is working ticks against my google calendars shows a few doesn't show most disappointing
__label__4 super good but the any do moment no longer pops up on my new pixel 3a which is the only reason i use this it is enabled but only shows up in notifications no popup how do i get this working again
__label__3 good planner and reminder
__label__4 planned not bad
"__label__3 it's too confusing for me i got the part how to play the game but the 
rewards are too many and too confusing would have loved the app if the 
game was simple with better graphics"
__label__1 went for pro for the whitelist yet i still cant off my phone or visit the internet when i need to
__label__3 i have the app on my phone and my ipad and they do not communicate everything that i input on my phone i have to re input on my ipad i'm signed into the same account on both it would be nice if they would communicate also i don't understand why the computer app is available separately and for a much more expensive price
__label__2 the widget doesn't update with the system time often stuck until i interact with it greatly impacting usability i have locked the app to not be closed in recents and a fix to this issue will change my rating i did pay to customize the clock face and it's far better than the default choices though
__label__4 excellent app and honestly my life would be so disorganised without it really helps me to stay on track my only request would be to give me greater control over when events repeat than the current setup of every day week 2 weeks etc e g allow me to repeat events on weekdays or even better specific days like mondays and wednesdays for instance otherwise the app is sublime if this small detail is added then i see no reason to withhold my 5 start reading from you great app
__label__1 app hasnt synced in 190 days won't let me log out still loads all my old data from last sync hasnt been updated since 2018 that should be the best clue dont buy
__label__5 one thing most apps lack is the calendar this app has the list and calendar integrated into one you can actually see your entire day of what you have to do in one app great job guys my 1 planning app so far
__label__1 the app crashes every now and then no point of using the app when the timer freezes and the app stops responding it is happening from the past 2 weeks kindly do something about it because a lot of people seem to be facing the same problem
__label__1 the new notifications are atrocious the don't follow light or dark theme in android 10 they don't work well with wear os and they turn on my screen when i don't want them to i'm now getting reminder pop ups when i don't want any and the option to turn them off is gone 10 24 2019 i downgraded to v5 2 3 and got the reminder pop ups option in settings notifications back when i update to 5 3 0 the reminder pop ups option is replaced with notifications and notification font options
__label__2 the design is nice but it doesn't understand when i said 'later' when i said remind me tomorrow morning it replied okay i'll be reminded tomorrow at 16 00 that's afternoon i'll be very well roasted by my boss by then can't find any help on these issues was close to confirming my subscription sad
__label__5 i love forest it was the first app in which i paid for the premium version and it was so worth it it is very cute motivational and easy to use the only suggestion i have for future updates is for the user to be able to customize plant placement thank you forest developers update i have been using forest for about 6 months now and still love it i just want to say how much i appreciate the forest team listening to feedback and providing amazing customer support thank you
__label__5 it's cutting edge of all to do list apps
"__label__3 you're good guys your efforts are admirable please consider making the app 
available to milions of people and support rtl"
__label__3 wish the google assistant integration could be improved every time i ask it to set a ticktick reminder it just shows tiktok also every time i restart my phone i need to boot up the app otherwise the widget panel doesn't show up
__label__4 i really like this app getting to know all the little features that are included in the free version it has helped me with my productivity as a sales professional and given me more control of task that need to be done daily to often get forgotten i recommend this to anyone that find using a to do list helpful
__label__1 the app would be nice if it actually gave you a tutorial on how it should be used it seems almost like clickbait with one appealing look and then it's not what you expected or needed yes it's very organized and but nothing is explained
__label__2 does not have a recurring task feature useless for me
__label__1 i previously gave 5 stars new feature forces 1 star when you view a project you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub projects is terrible please allow it as an option or revert i set up all my stores costco walmart etc now there is no way to look at my entire shoping list i know i could drag sub tasks but 1 it's too easy to complete the parent task thus completing all child tasks not good 2 moving tasks from one parent task to another is also very dif
__label__3 good app the way subtasks are structured are a pain in the ass though
__label__5 i love this app so much they make it really fun for free players too so you don't feel left out if you don't spend money i have decided to get a subscription though since it's such a great app it has my whole family super motivated my kids are actually loving doing chores and i also love all the social aspects to it as well it would be cool of you could assign names for your pets and the app doesn't function quite the same as the website version but overall i have no complaints
__label__5 this app is amazing i use it for many tasks that are continuous and i mostly don't remember and it keeps me up to date with those tasks i did have an inconvenience with the pomodoro timer being cancelled at the middle of it but i do not use that feature a lot so i still give it a 5 star review
__label__3 it's better to have biweekly schedule im using this app to manage my to do list unfortunately it doesnt have every other week schedule or biweekly schedule to be honest i have lot of things to do during that schedule because my oayout is every other week so i really need to have that kind of schedule olease add that up thank you
__label__2 can't see new topics of discussion also can't add discussion topic even though i have excellent internet connection wi fi or data please fix i have no connection issues with any of my other apps
__label__3 it is a fine app
__label__4 great app but for some time i am not able to create an event from the widget i have even paid for the app hoping it will resolve itself but this feature still isn't working properly
__label__2 i couldn't find an easy way to make a project recurring without using templates or add attachments and notes to individual tasks
__label__4 i'm struggling to see the use of routines and programmes right now but the other features are really useful would love the option for a task's or to do list
__label__2 lots of emails notifications that you can not stop most of the features you need including seeing a completed task are all in the pro version needs payment edit after doist reply i mean the email notifications for the due jobs on the lists they keep filling my email every day and i could not stop them
__label__3 things to do add a move task icon to the single selection toolbar it's currently in the menu annoying use the de facto android standard for multiple selection the long press gosh other than that 3 stars for the occasional bugs tasks are often slow to move as in i move a task then after 2s it goes back then moves again making it a mess tasks got sometimes lost in other subtasks because the drag and drop gesture is clumsy
__label__1 excellent ui easy to use and sync to gmail events and tasks all at once since the last update on feb 13 2020 this app shows video ad after modify calendar which you cannot close until the ad is finished you have to be careful if you are in quiet environment ie meetings
__label__1 very good app but in widget there is a no option in list wise select today tomorrow or all please update for this option then it will be far better please update example if there's a call list in widget it shows in call widget list all call today tomorrow other all day but it should option to select today tomorrow etc
__label__3 different colors are not available for different tasks
__label__4 the percentage calculation and the number of days successful in a week month seems confusing otherwise it's a really good app
__label__4 missing one key feature custom sorting of lists otherwise quite good search capability is excellent
__label__3 there are some bugs in the latest version that i haven't had before it's always lagging and nothing is loading in the app
__label__3 if time tracking was added and the parser interface of the what would you like to do field was fixed this alone is making me want to switch back to amazing marvin i would rate 5 stars
__label__5 this app does a great job of cleaning up the google calendar and making it more user friendly i use it all the time for my business
__label__5 any do is one of the best productivity app i've made my whole family download it
"__label__3 has good potential you guys should allow the app to display the date when 
a task is due for example if i have to remember what day something is due 
 i e haircut appt wed 7 25 18"
__label__3 i love wunderlist one huge feature that to do is missing is i can't manually reorder individual tasks in the list i used to be able to move it up and down according to the order i want it done
__label__2 i like this app but its useless if i go on a different app it just gives me a warning and carries on would be better if there was some sort of consequence for using other apps
__label__3 the best android calendar app for power users however since a year or so it freezes with almost every use making it practically impossible to use not sure if this is a widespread problem or just me support has been responsive and has tried to reproduce the problem but in vain the option of sending a logfile for analysis is unfortunately not available a pity as it is a great app i still haven't found any other remotely as good as this one
__label__1 you block new entry on my existing list and force me to upgrade to premium if i won't to continue
__label__1 requires my email no thanks
__label__3 for some reason i can't exit the app which i press the back button on lenovo yoga smart tab only home or app switch buttons please fix
__label__3 i wish more options be available to free version
__label__4 great task and project management app user friendly and versatile lists and sub lists work well for most to do list requirements would just recommend to developers to introduce a couple of improvements 1 there should be a difference between the date you plan to do a task and its deadline due date 2 would be great to be able to add a description and deadline to a sub list thereby creating little projects
__label__3 it would be better if there is an option in which we are able to check whether we really followed time table or not
__label__4 awesome app it helps me a lot to organize my life work and other stuffs the features are really amazing would recommend this to my friends and colleagues
__label__5 best app it keeps me organise and it's great app exactly what i was looking for
__label__3 i have a problem the i want to bar at the bottom is covering up the someday subsection of tasks please fix this
__label__4 fantastic except i cant attach photos to a task a picture is worth a thousand words otherwise it's the best app for lists keeping work and home seperate ect
__label__4 love this app can guys add this features please 1 task priority tag red for important 2 more notifications options sometimes a single clicking sound is not enough wish you add alarm settings thanks
__label__3 nice but no daily notification come
__label__3 great ui the idea is great but need a way to mark tasks routine item as complete and so we can't even know our progress guess the use case itself is completely different
__label__4 the concept is absolutely amaizing but the procedures are very complex can you plaese make another app with same concept and with simple procedures in simple words please make a simple app which has concept of gaming type rewards on completing important tasks
__label__5 best to do list app i have used
__label__4 awesome
__label__3 best app to use 3 star only because it is not available in hindi language whenever it will be in hindi language i will add my 2 star thanks team todoist
__label__4 works well just what i need
__label__3 this is good but you need to update where we can sync on our desktop or another phone via google or else
__label__3 this app has done a good job of helping me keep track of tasks dailies habits and the to do with checklists have been wonderful i just don't like the new redesign nothing looks to be where it should be to me it now feels bulky and clunky and i feel like it will make me use it a lot less because it is now uncomfortable to look at
__label__1 awesome
__label__3 everything about this app is perfect except for the widget support the widget doesn't update with the new tasks i make in the app and i wish i could mark tasks as complete right from the widget i would also like to be able to make multiple notifications for one task or set one task to repeat multiple times a day i also wish the notification for the mission would show up every time great start
__label__2 being able to slide tasks up and down on the fly is a critical feature which needs to be brought over from wunderlist i plan and order my work day tasks with it and need to be able to adjust the order quickly and frequently my wife and i also were using wunderlist as a grocery list sharing tool same complaint as we like to order the list to match our path through the grocery store i see a few people miss this option in the reviews without it the app doesn't work for me
__label__5 i've tried several rpg to do lists but this one is the best out of them all it contains all of the features you need to motivate yourself to get off your butt and do something in your life especially during this period of quarantine read the user guide in settings after installing to understand how it works and get to it a big thanks to developer for their quick responses
__label__2 two stars bc i have adhd and i really wanted it to work it isn't user friendly and i can't give it the time of day to sit and figure it out i'll try again later maybe this fall
__label__3 basically i satisfied with this app but i can't change trees even though i unlock the new trees i'm using an android phone please fix this bug immediately
__label__5 great app
__label__2 at first this app worked well then the next day this app stopped notifying my next activities it stucked on the last activity before the next day
__label__3 good app
__label__5 tengo la versión gratuita de la aplicación by la verdad es bastante completa hasta ahora no he tenido la necesidad de suscribirme a premium muy linda interfaz y una vez aprendes la posibilidad de cosas que puedes hacer es bastante intuitiva y con muchas opciones
__label__5 simple and effective i really enjoy the unobtrusive way of making sure you log your data
__label__5 for those looking to manage their habits and tasks in one app habitnow is just for you no mpre need to sketch trackers that aren'y as nearly accessible as your phone
__label__3 looking good todo manager the premium was already expensive for india but i just realized that not only they increased the price but the price indians pay would be more than the us price now that's called a rip off
__label__3 if you delete the app or transfer phones you will lose everything all past progress is gone and you can not get it back you also can never use that login info again just keep that in mind also if you set your habit goal for example twice a week you'll still get reminders everyday no options to change it to only notify when goal needs to be completed
__label__3 phone computer sync could be improved also doesn't have a timer for your rest between pomodoros
__label__4 reminder popups are not displaying at the bottom of my screen on my new samsung galaxy s20 ultra they only appear in the notification area at the top of screen is this an android 10 issue how do i get the popups again it worked fine on my samsung galaxy s8
__label__2 bug that says 'path 'type' is required' everytime i try to do something i tried submittinf an error report through menu about report a bug but i get the same error message when i try report the bug
__label__5 this app helps motivate me to complete my personal goals love it
__label__1 do not pay for the app sync doesn't work they dont support the app but they are always ready to take your money
__label__1 very laggy
__label__4 for a hobby project as described by the author it is a job very well done i don't have any complaints may be upgrading the ux not the ui a little bit would make it an excellent experience for the end user
__label__2 i love the app but i wish there was a separate page for notes i know that you can add notes when you create a task but i'd like to see a designated page just for notes other than that i never liked subscription models i think way more people would actually buy it myself included if it would be a one time fee
__label__3 good please remove purchase or keep a pin while the time of purchase good nice to focus
__label__1 after purchase sync is not working then y sholud i purchase this app profile name is empty while editing it says something went wrong and so on
__label__5 this app is really is the best it helps me to do everything on time and keeps me organized this app has really easy set ups too
__label__2 have to create an account just to check out functionality don't want to do that uninstalling
__label__4 تطبيق جميل ويساعد حقا
__label__3 the problem is the phone is not ringing even though ring is turned on output is given alarm volume yet its not ringing
__label__3 i love this app so far but the notifications are not really working for me
__label__4 would be good to have a tomorrow list so when in bed clearing mind at the end of the day the default list my day isn't cleared
__label__3 the app does not let me create a widget despite the fact that i have logged in
__label__4 simple and straightforward
"__label__3 i'm liking the app so far but the widget does not sync with the app so 
renders that function useless suggestion to add a refresh button to the 
widgets so i don't have to open the app every time"
__label__3 it's good but you can only have 5 habits to track if you want more in displease because it's like a demo but nobody tells you
__label__5 excellent this is even better than wunderlist which i really loved they've taken it up another level brilliant cross platform tool for managing all my tasks
__label__3 i recently changed from wunderlist i had no problems whatsoever with wunderlist it's perfect for me today i needed to use my to do list and it has signed me out after a load of mucking around with passwords i finally got into it but it was too late to do the task that was required
__label__1 i had set an alarm of certain task which is suppose to repeat all the week days but it had notified me only once or twice and it had not been repeated all the settings were perfect it was active even but does not does it work for you all it is not recommended
__label__4 easy to use and good at keeping me motivated throughout the day
__label__1 it doesn't notify me when the time is up unless i open my phone and check it voluntary this totally defeats the purpose of me not having to open my phone when i don't need to hope you guys could fix this issue
__label__5 extremely useful once you get a hang of how it works
__label__3 i am pro user please add more music
__label__4 love the idea but the execution is kind of clumsy there's little to no guidance with regard to how parties or challenges work and the rewards seem to be random at best the graphics are adorable and the app definitely has potential though but it would be more user friendly to streamline the app because it can be overwhelming with so many choices and options i e mounts food eggs etc that seem mostly arbitrary
__label__4 its good but can work on notifocation panel
__label__1 bad ui bad quick short cuts
__label__4 excellent job i don't give you 5 because i don't wanna see the panel on status bar when i already completed my tasks it's very annoying to me if you will resolve this problem then i will give you 5 insha allah
__label__5 i found this app to be pretty useful whenever i need to get something done i go onto this app and plant a tree or bush i recommended this to a few of my friends and they're enjoying it too
__label__5 second day of usuing above my spectation
__label__4 can this please get a feature where i can add tasks when offline and it uploads to the server whenever i connect to the internet at the moment it simply deletes everything
__label__5 this is a superb organisational app it met my needs when i was hunting around to replace another to do app that failed with an upgrade i would recommend this to anyone
__label__3 my original review seems to have disappeared i have an issue on my galaxy note s8 where i can't turn off the alarms without uninstalling i received a response from support but couldn't respond directly their response was simply that i should be able to swipe the notification and the sound go away yes i agree that should happen however that isn't what happens there is no notification from the app for the alarm i receive other notifications from the app running out of room to explain
__label__1 after some time i deleted this app because of the lack of storage and now i downloaded 3 times but i starteded growing plant this is obvious but i can use my phone and the tree dosen't spoiled and it dosent give me remainder and this app is full updated repair this problem it don't giv remainder to me repair it soon as possible
__label__3 quite good but also need some improvement
__label__1 this app doesnt open at all
__label__1 very pricey
__label__1 good on paper tried it out and off the bat wouldn't sync any news items wish it had an option to at least input items directly either way didnt work
__label__5 nice app for time table and reminder
__label__3 the app ui has changes have made it very annoying to use in some cases the custom timer most used by me is all the way to the end and scrolling to it sometimes erases everything written in the reminder
__label__1 completed tasks continue to reappear
__label__3 i really like this app but i stopped using it because it's too hard to type out my entire routine on the app i wish it was windows compatible
__label__4 one of the best apps to boost your productivity replete with useful features even in the free version love their habit feature
__label__4 this is a great app for anybody needing some extra motivation or a way to organize their life i've had some trouble editing or deleting reoccurring tasks but this may be a device issue i'm not sure
__label__1 it always reactivate calendar from all google account on the device and show it eventhough i have untick it in the calendar task list calendar is full with unneeded event and the essentials wont show
__label__2 it's not worth the premium i tried to get a refund because it wasn't what i thought it would be and no one has contacted me they claim to read every single email but can't reply to a paid customer i will be deleting this app and regretting the 8 purchase
__label__3 i uninstalled because the app was a little confusing it has a great idea and all bit i just didnt quite get how to use it
__label__4 it's cool
__label__3 update the accidental deletion problem described below is compounded by my now finding a confirm before deleting setting that simply does not work the app is nice but when starring or opening a list item it's easy to delete it that's because deleting happens when you slide an item left and that can happen by accident either add a working setting to optionally require confirmations of deletes or provide a trash can from which you can recover deleted items
__label__3 not a bad app pretty good got a few things organized with it
__label__2 nowhere near as good as wunderlist which i've been using for several years gutted that microsoft are stopping wunderlist in favour of this very poor substitute not feeling the love for microsoft anymore
__label__2 i try to set tasks for only specific days of the week but it does not work after i complete the task that's it it's done forever doesn't repeat since most of my tasks need this feature to work the app really isn't good for me
__label__2 this app is a pretty good one but on my galaxy note it stopped allowing me to check off tasks for some reason i paid for the pro version before this happened unfortunately
__label__2 the app stop responding for many days already it is disturbing that it stops after 5 secs whenever i open the app still stopping
__label__2 wish it didnt have to connect to the calandar i wanted to keep my phones calandar widget separate from this but its impossible disappointing
__label__4 love habitica i find the app often has one bug or another from update to update so can't really give 5 stars but the devs do a smashing job regardless so 4 stars from me
__label__1 its a good idea but an app like this shouldn't lock a whitelist behind a paywall i've already read the responses from the devs on the other reviews so i understand why it is but that doesn't change my review i listen to music and use flashcard apps dictionary apps art references and my gallery on my phone when doing what i needed this app for it's useless if it lacks that basic functionality will not pay for something that should be included in the free version
__label__5 awesome app really helpful in increasing concentration soothing music helps you ignore all disturbances your tree dies if you use any other app so your phone is also no longer a disturbance this app is really good for doing deep work
__label__4 nice format views and options my only suggestion is to improve the options that can be assigned when creating a new event
__label__3 great colors list notes with sub lists lots of options but terrible to navigate very confusing and all over the place if you want something very detailed will spend the time to learn to use it and want tons of colors to differiate your lists then this is for you
__label__4 i like this app it has a lot of the features i use all in one place however even though it lists all my google calendars i can't figure out how to do anything with them i have projects spread over a dozen calendars but i can't seem to add anything to any of them
__label__5 i love this calendar app this is the only digital calendar that i have been happy with i can easily see what i have coming up i love the 'tasks' and the ability to make my to do list right on the app and the ability to easily snooze a task ii didn't get to until tomorrow love it
__label__3 the should be some kind of dashboard where as administrator monitor progress on particular tasks and also have tasks maned by two or more personal
__label__2 it used to be a slick minimal app that did what it needed to then they kept adding layers of unneeded features and forced people to make an account just to use it no thanks
__label__4 i would like to be able to import my contacts to it i would give 5 stars for that
__label__3 after last update all info's gone shame on you android never more
__label__4 it s one of the best liferpg apps i have ever seen with lot of options but it can have some more beautiful transparent widgets and if you add an option that a task directly influences a characteristics it can be more comfortable
__label__2 good not bad
__label__2 all the main options are charged then why list the app for free might as well list it as charged app
__label__3 a very interesting idea i would give 5 stars but there are minor bugs in the apps i can't choose my user name it says there are all taken i'm sure no one else would use it and i cant add a daily task it shows an error when i try to add one is not the enum for frequency or something similar please fix this i really love this idea
__label__3 i constantly get a message problem with the server please fix this i liked the app a lot but i am unable to use it cause it doesn't connect nor update my tasks
__label__1 widget is mostly useless it constantly displays no items while having a list selected that is well populated alternately the widget becomes logged out somehow hope this gets fixed
__label__3 miss the dark theme
__label__4 great concept reminders do not work and from some quick research it appears this has been an issue for literal years now i was really hoping i could have the app remind me of tasks instead of setting a hundred alarms on my phone i'd prefer not to have both i'd really appreciate if reminders would actually work
__label__4 very good it is good to keep as a reminder for personal work
__label__3 it is a good application it is very useful it is just okay
__label__3 can you please enable different ringtone modes and if the app could notify us if we have missed a reminder it'll be great
__label__1 for years we used wunderlist for work including employees without corporate accounts for family outside organisation and across continents todo failed from the get go but to be fair so do most other tasklist apps we tried many we finally moved to trello a bit different to wunderlist and not quite as intuitive but works across platforms across organisations it sadly seems ms loves to destroy good things wunderlist was such a good product we were really sad to see it go
__label__5 love this simple app it works well apart from the odd inconsequential blip it has helped me to organise my day list all my to dos so they're not in my head it's simple enough to learn how to use quickly and i've got my daily schedule on repeat so regular events pop up daily weekly monthly or as one off dates
__label__4 i like the app but there is one thing that annoys the hell out of me i use a number of sublists for shopping whenever the screen changes orientation or auto rotates the app defaults back to the first sub list and i have to reopen the one i was working with very annoying update my opinion of the app is unchanged but snarky respones from the developer are uncalled for i get it it's free and i'm not using a lower end device maybe find a new hobby if you don't like comments
__label__5 best app ever for time management and planning sectograph rocks
__label__3 really pretty good app but two problems 1 sometimes repeat weekly reminders don't work at all especially if you haven't ticked it the previous week 2 please allow multiple reminders for one event thanks it's really promising and useful otherwise
__label__3 i love the app but you cannot add file to your task or schedule this lack of ability to add file on such good app make it incomplete i could have rated it 5
__label__1 the app still doesn't work well i can still go back and use other apps when i press the homescreen button last time it didn't work and i couldn't use other social medias now the tree grows while i use the app
__label__3 ok but need to improve
__label__3 it s a great app and works great helps me keep track of whether or not i took pills or did excercises or not however it lacks the feature of multiple times a day so if for instance a person was trying to create a habit to do something twice in one day this app won't help since you can only click that you did it once does anybody know if thier is an app that has this feature
__label__3 but of a downgrade from wunderlist please add a button to create a task from the main screen
__label__2 updated to the latest version and the store would not load anymore plus my trees planted for the day does not record anymore
__label__1 i used to love this app but it always crashes now i can't even open this app
__label__2 too many premium features
__label__2 the check boxes could be bigger and other such things could be made clearer also an option to see all the items in individual folder from the 4 3 weekly widget
__label__5 so far so good i've been using it for about a week it's easy to set up habits a schedule and reminders checking things off and seeing my success rate is very motivating to me i upgraded it's a one time fee of only 7 99
__label__3 nice app but i can not add any winget to my mobile screen
__label__1 updates keep making the app worse for power users i can no longer type 3p to make something due at 3pm when renaming a task in fact i cant find a way to assign a time to a task after its been created at all if i do it the long way assign time choose time on clock click ok the time never gets assigned i can no longer type p1 to give it first priority when renaming a task i used these features all the time and now it takes me significantly more time to perform these actions
__label__4 like it colors change order multiple list completing date
__label__5 i've been using this app for about 3 years now it is by far the most user friendly habit tracking app i've tried
__label__4 i like using the app and my weekly progress i would like to see a total of how many things i did each day and maybe a graph i like positive reinforcement
__label__3 overall decent functionality but clunky execution the premium version has good calendar functions but the notifications are spotty and don't work well with my phone which defeats the purpose for me the sub task feature is nice but organizing them is difficult
__label__3 this app is great and it already helping me stay on track with some things it's surprising how much imaginary experience points can motivate but i am having a bug where dailies can't be set for a given day they just revert to all days being checked i want this app to keep me accountable for working out on certain days so this is a major flaw
__label__3 the game is very buggy i just bought a reward then the app crashed and the gold i've spent is gone but i didn't receive the reward these kind of experiences unfortunately decrease the gaming fun tremendously and it could be such a good game otherwise
__label__5 i have never rated an app before i rave about it to others it's the perfect blend of simplicity and options to customize i love having the widget on my phone i expanded it so i can see many items on my list i love the different options for reminders and snoozing i have a hard time transitioning from task to task only thing i struggle with is the manual reorder of tasks hold and drag works better for moving tasks down than up maybe my screen is not responsive enough or i'm clumsy
__label__2 was working fine before but it's not working now not registering my events
__label__3 marvellous
__label__4 good
__label__4 great app but i would prefer some changes in its interface
__label__1 installed it and it glitched and didn't display many of the images on the 'create your avatar' page immediately uninstalled
__label__4 this is the best time blocking app i've found but it still has some significant pain points i wish there was a desktop version since creating updating blocks would be 5x faster with a keyboard mouse and large screen editing would be faster too if blocks could temporarily overlap and if routines were per day instead of per week
__label__2 reminders doesn't work
__label__4 this is a great app
__label__4 in my opinion this is the best task management tool out there fyi i've tried todoist nirvana notion microsoft to do wunderlist google tasks any do none of these apps had that many features that worked so well together as in ticktick i use this app to plan my every day and it's awesome i don't have much money atm pun intended and can't get the premium but free plan is offering so many features that it doesn't hinder my performance here unlike in other apps
__label__2 when editing or deleting a recurring task it should ask if you're doing it just for this task or all recurring tasks instead of deleting and editing all tasks without asking 2 when creating a recurring task i should be able to time it on different times for each reccuring day instead of having to create the same reccuring task for each seperate day
__label__2 user interface not friendly
__label__2 quick add got fixed now the sync is broken
__label__1 it won't allow you to create an account with e mail address and password why give you the option but then doesn't work when you use it if not resolved within a week uninstalling app
__label__3 it's easy enough to use as it is but for a fully paid app the graphs are incredibly lackluster and basically useless all you get is some minuscule measly bar graphs which are tiny and get this they don't even label the metric you're tracking as they are displayed in the order in which your goal list is so unless you memorize that goal 7 is say exercise daily you won't even know what you're looking at additionally the streaks are glitchy as hell and often times do not calculate correctly really wish they also had aggregate goals for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy no gluten and no sugar it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs and come on add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month
__label__5 really helpful for daily scheduling lists and calendar and nicer look than competitors habit function could be smoother and stickier with timed reminders and a quick check box like the tasks plus a visual of the streak don't need two steps and a graphic every time i take my vitamins
__label__2 app cannot keep track of an atypical everytime i set the day one it just resets after day 5 back to day one instead of skipping two days and then 2 day 1 like a normal week would work i'm deleting this app for sure
__label__4 useful but slow to synchronize across devices could evolve to become even more uh ser friendly
__label__4 this app is great but i have some suggestions that would even better improve the quality of using the app for example something like being able to edit the tasks widgets to show 'due soon' instead of just tasks for that day for even better planning
__label__2 lately the ads have doubled in frequency have become full screen noisy and more difficult to close while the overall usability have decreased quite shame and before telling the it's free slogan think that annoyed people will delete not buy
__label__3 一 f厂了 b可cncc rv
__label__1 please make it possible to quickly switch from the widget to the app one star to attract attention will make it 5 as soon as widgettoappbutton appears
__label__3 good app that i can use for putting all my appointments in one problem is that the notifications i set to make sure it reminds me don't go off at all i have a droid turbo 2 if you guys could fix that i will change to 5 stars
__label__4 this would have been a 5 star to app if it wasnt for one miner problem i didn't like you can't choose pm or am times and it's just a annoying and confusing
__label__3 everything is locked repetition schedule is unable
__label__1 dear developers thank you for deleting all my reminders after updating the app it was not pleasant at all believe me
__label__4 very useful but a feature to postpone events more easily would be nice
__label__5 makes managing an ever changing task list with various deadlines manageable highly recommend
__label__5 my life is a million times more organized with ticktick i just wish that they'd do a one time payment rather than subscription but i'm sure they've done their market research love them
__label__4 if you can get it on a good deal or already own the cb1 pro although one needs to install both app in order to get the pro fearures than it's a no brainer well almost as it still can't sync google reminders into it's own task section which is a shame
__label__2 used it awhile ago and recently installed on my new phone as soon as it opened it was clear i would not be able to use it several things where off like trying to put pictures in an office doc worse still when i try to add many options are cut off by some form of white box that sits in the way unfortunately dailies are one of the missing options and a huge part of how i personally used the app
__label__1 i consider it as not easy to use
__label__3 when we install this app and use for the first time it works perfectly but next day when you try to open this app it gets stopped i tried multiple of time and no improvmnt
__label__3 nice app but after enabling it whenever i tried to open clock from taskbar this aap gets open instead which i don't what
__label__1 doesn't allow you to unsubscribe from premium and the developers don't even respond whether on email or twitter
"__label__2 i got this thinking i could use it as a gear 2 watch face it's a cool idea 
but would be much better if i could use it on my gear 2"
__label__2 useless you need a premium account to use widgets
__label__4 very fun and a good way to stay focused i do recommend this app the sounds come broken sometimes it should be fixed
__label__1 deleted app due to not putting things in i was looking forward to using this app i am getting the same issues as sharlyn
__label__2 don't get any notification at all
__label__5 super usefull plain and simple
__label__4 good
__label__4 was a big fan but changed the clock to spinner scrolling is a pain why did you guys change it bring back the normal clock asap
__label__2 it good and useful app
__label__3 would be nice to once you delete one thing that it would not ask if it's the series
__label__3 decent enough gtd app but i only started using it after reading it will be integrated with google assistant soon seems like they've been touting this integration for months with no real action or even updates on when we can expect this disappointing
__label__3 i wish it could use the hey google feature it only works with amazon alexa right now price is cheap so far so good
__label__5 my favorite habit tracking app i am the author of multiple books on how to build better habits and regularly speak at conferences on how to create behavioral change this app is my secret tool for keeping myself accountable and i recommend it to all my clients simple and easy to use the one thing that would make it better would be if it had some reminders notifications otherwise it's close to perfect
__label__2 i'm just not finding time to work with this app so by no means the star rank im giving the apl is just a temp ranking
__label__3 confusing without a lot of explanation on what is what might be good when i figure it out but it's not a real intuitive app and has a figure it out curve
__label__3 this was a great app a year or more ago the simplicity of adding and checking off tasks without clutter of a bunch of fancy features was it's strength basically it was as simple as making a list on a piece of paper with the added bonus of having reminders now however it requires more steps to add to dos and is becoming more of a complicated app loosing the original appeal as of some time ago notifications also stopped working which mean i will leave after some 5 years of use
__label__4 it would be nice if there are pre set goals or task to choose from while the app allow for a high level of customization it's too much hassle to set it all up properly not to mention balancing the reward from each task
__label__3 no integration with google assistant
__label__4 great app life changing if used properly easy to use i have paid for premium but not getting my reminders popping up with notifications for app on can you help
__label__1 completely unusable on android right now everything is blank or not loading downloaded and deleted right away which is unfortunate because it looked like something i'd be really interested in
__label__4 i love the app it has helped me a lot by helping me easily track my habits i gave it a four because i sent them an email months ago they never answered
__label__1 1 why are you disabling enter key's next line function when i click enter key next line does not come so i used other apps to type with new lines by using enter key 2 now when i cut and paste the exact contents from another app even then it does not appear line by line it appears as a paragraph
__label__2 being able to slide tasks up and down on the fly is a critical feature which needs to be brought over from wunderlist i plan and order my work day tasks with it and need to be able to adjust the order quickly and frequently my wife and i also were using wunderlist as a grocery list sharing tool same complaint as we like to order the list to match our path through the grocery store i see a few people miss this option in the reviews without it the app doesn't work for me
__label__3 eu amo este aplicativo e uso sincronizado com o meu google calendar porem de um tempo para cá mesmo com a configuraçao para manter no google calendar as tarefas ja executadas no todolist o evento do google calendar some podem verificar era muito importante pra mim que os eventos continuassem no google calendar minha versao nao é premium e estava pensando em comprar estou com medo de comprar e continuar assim obrigada
__label__4 rarely read never do i write reviews but this app has been transformative for my life and productivity in general the only issue i sometimes have is the custom song i apply to notifications doesnt always play
__label__3 great app but it's not syncing properly please fix
__label__5 i've been looking for a habit like tracker via google search not really knowing the term or if an app really existed once i found what i was looking for habitica showed up i installed it to my phone looked up a youtube video of it and began using it now i'm hooked and 12 days in getting my life straightened up cleaning house doing daily chores and doing things i usually hate doing habitica just makes it fun to do with it being an rpg i love it and cannot recommend it enough
__label__5 i am really enjoying this app so far it's just what i was looking for to keep myself on a routine and the price is great
__label__3 i wanted to like it i've always drooled at the idea of having a to do list app integrate with a calender but alas this version is clunky you can't delete a single date of a recurring calender event meaning you can't flexibly plan your day while beginning with a rough outline i switched over to to doist and google calender instead
__label__2 i really like this app enough to purchase the premium a few years back but the app didn't update to premium for me and there was no response when i contacted the support seems like i'm not alone in this experience don't put your trust in the developers
__label__5 love making tge earth green
__label__1 don't waste your money instead to get a free trial you have to select business even if you aren't a business then you can still experience the miserable support experience of 6 days of radio silence and it has now been 48 hours of radio silence on my urgent ticket the app system api is fairly good but i would expect better bug support if they claim to have a business or even premium plan
__label__3 bug message cannot be displayed on app android 9 nokia 6 1 plus
"__label__2 this app was amazing when i first started using it now it duplicates tasks 
too much i have about 20 of the same task for each day and it takes 
forever for me to delete the extra tasks"
__label__4 still needs some work to get it up to par with wunderlist but works ok
__label__4 not upto the mark but its okay ads give ptoblem and ui is little weak
__label__4 i love the basic version it really helps me stay organized
__label__5 i'm trying to develop some healthy habits and this app is very good at reminding me to do things the only complaint i have is that you can't actually organize your tasks and habits i try to organize them by time and they don't move i have a habit for 12pm listed after one for 3am which is preceded by 4pm this is very frustrating when you want to look at things in order that's why i'm docking 1 i like the function of it and i like the widget update 1 restored thank you for helping
__label__3 the new video ad is really annoying it pops out and no way to close it unless you close the entire app it really interrupt when you want to add a few appointments to the calendar
__label__2 the app worked fine for awhile but all the events i added were simply gone this morning this was a frustrating experience
__label__3 does not work for oreo
__label__5 excellent
__label__4 it's a lot of fun good personalization i have to make time to explore the app called more fully i think a tutorial would be amazing and pre developed lists that could be tweaked
"__label__3 everything is amazing but one thing needs a high quality internet 
connection if the connection is just a little bit low the app works 
terrible sadly i don't have a very good internet connection so as much as 
i love the app doesn't work for me"
__label__3 i am setting daily targets it means when i open the app i should able to see it as a list weekly target monthly targets yearly targets are to be alrady suppose to be designed my work is assingining task i suppose wishing to add for daily or weekly or monthly or yearly targets
__label__4 so far so good you have to be willing to set on the app for a bit to figure it out it's a rpg game based off of truth the app does freeze fairly frequently but you just have to close it and reopen it and everything is back in order
__label__4 it's an excellent app very helpful i have one problem with it that i couldn't easily copy tasks from one day to another if there is an easy way to do it please help me
__label__3 android widgets don't work anymore clicking on done circle but nothing updates only by restarting the phone removing and re adding widget to screen uninstalled
__label__2 does this app work without internet connection also
__label__2 this is not an rpg this is a goal tracker with an avatar ffs so useless
__label__3 nice app
__label__1 i just cannot be notified please fix it so i could give 5 stars
__label__2 after reinstall data not recover while take backup google drive
__label__4 by far and away the best of all the dozens of task manager apps i've tried using so intuitive can't wait for the upcoming feature that's on the way but gotta thumbs down the new widget no way to open the app straight from the widget so i removed the widget from my home screen all together
__label__1 unrecoverably crashed reinstalled then the data partially gone pretty disappointed no response from the devs in hindsight this is an app that haven't released for more than a year so could have been expected data is not critical of course bunch of date markers but it feels like all those habits disappeared with the data
__label__5 good
__label__5 awesome
__label__1 not able to go for pro as the japanese page pops up and i am not understanding anything
__label__1 i am unable to upgrade my account to premium i've tried multiple times but to no avail
__label__1 i haven't gotten past step 1 it has failed to import any of my data from wunderlist
__label__3 not too bad
__label__1 awful at one point i bought the business calendar 2 app and i the update has ads i'm supposed to purchase the newest version yeah no thanks
__label__3 it's not bad
__label__2 upon using the app so far i wish that it would be accessible offline other than that the idea to challenge yourself to earn points for your habits and chores is quite remarkable
__label__4 confused i'm not sure what happened and i'm glad i didn't have a long grocery list because i just had to transfer everything from my grocery list to a new one so it would open like a normal list and not as a pop up i don't understand why y'all thought that was a good idea but whatever i've clicked everything i can think to click convert to regular list isn't an option that i've seen anywhere is that only in premium
__label__3 i do have a few problems but the app is fairly easy and i can keep up with everything quite well
__label__3 a few major issues 1 the addition of sections in projects is nice but not useful if they only appear in project view but not filters 2 the sections cannot be reordered to appear at the top of a list the can only be at the end of a task list 3 in filtered view pulling subtasks out of their parent task or non completable tasks is ludicrous duplicating them like that is silly at best
__label__4 great calendar love you can use different colours for entries on the same day wish i could use colour to shade the background of different days tho can use symbols emojis too
__label__5 it's been great a great to do list app
__label__3 this is all well and good but it doesn't tell me how to use to do to do anything like making separate list or subcategories for each list
__label__5 i have used this app before and it's really awesome it helps me with giving a challenge for focusing on my work and studies for the time i desire i enjoy growing trees and creating a forest while studying this app is the best for focusing with its whitelist feature i can even listen to music or talk to someone without destroying my tree i love this app thank you for this
__label__4 i really enjoy this app the design is very simple and well put together the cute designs of people enjoying their day when i finish tasks is almost rewarding and it's nice when the app tells me to enjoy my day off when i have no tasks i like that i can color code things and add subtasks as well as create different priority levels for tasks the only thing i wish it had was a monthly view then i would give it 5 stars
__label__4 i love this app a lot but it keeps closing everytime i try to use it after a couple of inactive days it have to keep uninstalling and installing it please fix this problem soon i really enjoy this app
__label__1 the app is ok cancellation is very awkward if you make it difficult to cancel a premium account it puts me off your company and your product
__label__3 nice layout but it will not sync repaired events between my tablet and phone i contacted tech support but they were unresponsive and not helpful i do not recommend
__label__2 i didn't know how to do anything
__label__4 thanks to you this app makes me more concentrated and schedulable in my days and its efficient visual time widget on the home screen is really practical but sync between calendar and app is a little time consuming
__label__3 app is amazing but ios version is so much better than android version it has many other settings while this one lacks them i hope this gets fixed so i can change my rate to 5 stars
__label__4 unable to tap widget to open app and open calender since update thank you for response sorted
__label__3 this one is very beautiful but its tree texture is not beautiful
__label__5 like the new schedule page
__label__4 you add execution note but when i check in history it just one word that appeared and the next is i confuse how to check the details hope the next update there is detail preview when tap a mission that's done in history and also search feature in history will be very useful to check some mission among all those missions in history thank you for great app
__label__1 note to self i did find an app that does not need my personal details in order to function edit it is clear that the developers of this app have absolutely no idea what they're doing because their app did request a password from me a password i was not willing to give i don't care that they are calling me a liar i am not asking anybody anything i am merely telling prospective clients what i experienced with this app and to be careful there are more secure apps available out there
__label__1 bad experience
__label__2 after changing my email i cannot use habitbull's premium features i have tried emailing support no response and finding a way to restore the purchase or even purchase it again but no such luck i am forever stuck with the app thinking i have pro even though i do not it's a shame really for what is otherwise a fantastic app
__label__5 nice
__label__5 excellent app continuous improvements make app be in the top 1 of productivity category
__label__3 nice
__label__3 expecting better need alarm facilty to remind me in advance
__label__3 updated it's widget can switch between calander todolist and view the events for the calander in the widget when clicking instead of it opening the calander app like most apps it's task list doesn't seem to sync to gtasks but the calander does upgrade to premium to add things like a recurring event daily planner whatsapp reminders extra colors etc
__label__2 every update have been a step backwards all the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so the last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly to default inbox project anymore now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project even though i just want to add quickly to the default inbox making the quick add widget useless now also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy monthly cost instead of one time
__label__1 used this app for months with no issues but after most recent update it plays an ad every time i add a new event to my calender awful
__label__3 hi i enjoyed the app but now it's crashing each time i try to open it and i have to reinstall it i wouldn't mind of it was the first time but this is like the fourth time it's happening mind looking into it
__label__3 it's good app but it's not free if you want to add more than 5 habit
__label__5 amazing
__label__4 likes free the possibility of arranging the tasks list in my own order with a simple clic ans scroll and having it in that order as home screen widget the possibility of having the events list widget just next to the tasks list widget the events list also show the tasks and this seemingly appears like the rare feature of an events list and tasks list integrated on one screen dislikes but it would be better if the tasks kept my prioritisation order even when they appear in the events list
__label__3 no tracking time
__label__1 deleting was great now horrible bad move with the ads guys
__label__1 this sucks i thought u could plant trees by just playing it and spending you're time on it but nohh you need to pay for it i'm not saying for you to change it but it just sucks
__label__2 i have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back they say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first i did email for answers but no one will answer my questions my questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people so this could be a great app but service is terrible which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping
__label__5 love this apps would be great if can aks before delete task
__label__3 not bad but wunderlist is better like wunderlist graphics and layout better want folders to be collapsed or even better a setting that lets me choose
__label__3 i love it but too expensive
__label__1 it would be better to add a comment on what exactly the time spent for every time we turn the timer on now it crash and never open in my new samsung galaxy s10 lite uninstalling it
__label__2 crashes on sign in on my pixel 2 xl
__label__5 i searched for quite some time to find a calendar app that my wife and i could share business calendar is an excellent solution we have it installed on our phones and tablets and all are in sync no more asking what she is doing today thanks bc team
__label__4 can u ads the sub task in the home page
__label__4 could you kindly add a weekly timetable looking kind of view
__label__2 i've loved using this calendar for years my favorite feature is the bar view in the month calendar i haven't found any other calendar app that does it this well but recently they ruined the free version by showing full screen pop up ads that play for up to 15 seconds before you can get back to your work i may have paid for the full version before they did this but not now if they're going to force uses to pay up 7 to remove such intrusive ads i'll just move on to another app
__label__2 not user friendly
__label__4 love the app but the reminder function is not working well otherwise app is awesome plz requested to fix it soon
__label__3 the app is good but ive few complains sometimes i need to use the web browser but i cant open it since it would wither my tree so thats a hassle and also make 1 tree for one hour
__label__5 a great way to set reminders for birthdays or any type of event
__label__5 very useful app
__label__4 excellent calender supplement i've been using ticktick along side my long term callander google calender as a planner for my daily tasks and university timetable and it's been nothing short of amazing life changing might sound like a stretch but it's helped me a tonne when it comes to getting stuffz done only thing i'd ask for is more options or a separate way of planning things like a university timetable to make it faster to add classes etc
__label__1 app didn't work at all was buggy from the start of my sign up where i used my google account to login
"__label__3 kindly add selection ringtones for alarm there should be an option to 
select alarm and the ringtone you want"
"__label__3 i can't allocate skill points while it's not something massive it 
certainly is a little frustrating"
__label__4 the app concept is so great it drives people to work on but there is an issue when i try to remove withered trees i click on watch ad to remove then it opens an ad but suddenly disappears the ad and it doesn't remove my wethered trees
__label__5 respected brother very nice app premium payment must be by other means as well and your contact details
__label__3 nice app
__label__3 can't find a way for new entries to be added to the top of a list rather than bottom
__label__1 sir i already did all step but i still face notification ringing problem
__label__2 sadly subpar even in 2020 missing most of the basic features that other small developer apps have pity for a microsoft app
__label__5 easy to use solid synchronization really good
__label__3 nice calendar but where is the jewish calendar maybe you could offer more options
__label__2 it's actually a really good app but because you can't disable pop up reminders it becomes really useless those pop ups disturb while doing other things with the phone and sometimes even block the screen while driving i'd like to receive all notifications but only in the status bar just like any other app
__label__4 this app is really usefull but i didn't figure so far how to set the app to wiyher my trees whenever i exit it use other apps while planting i saw a set of instructions but nine were helpful for the samsung device i posses i need to say i really except an answer that can help me solve my problem
__label__5 the best app of its kind it may appear difficult to get the hang of it at first but once you read the getting started guide you realise how easy it is to use one of the best app purchases i have made
__label__4 i'd give this a five star if not for the backing up which prevents importing mismatched versions kinda redundant if we can't use the backup that we took two weeks prior
__label__1 cannot get it to stop asking me to verify the time zone pressed yes kept asking pressed don't ask again kept asking pressed no kept asking finally deleted i'll use the the one that comes with outlook it's not as versatile but it doesn't ask me to verify my time zone every time i look at it especially when i ask it not to ask me again
__label__5 nice
__label__3 average at best needs undo option or on touch and that task is lost among all the other completed tasks needs links between tasks so dates can push out or come in very basic most will find themselves wanting more from a tasking app
__label__3 still want to go thoroughly with this app
__label__1 notifications don't work it's a shame because i wanted to buy a subscription edit okay i already know what's going on the operating system of my smartphone is miui this app's notifications work when the battery saver mode is turned off at the same time in the application settings i have the option no restrictions battery saver doesn't restrict app's activity other applications similar to this one todo habits work with this option and at the same time enable battery saving
__label__2 love and use the app but sync feature does not work and my attempts at eliciting support from customer service have gone unanswered which is disappointing
__label__2 just switched from wunderlist and miss it already why the widget won't let me display the tasks due today or this week like wunderlist did now there's only planned which list every task i've ever scheduled the design is very plain and it doesn't show the dates in different colours to spot what's overdue and generally picture the information quickly
__label__1 i can't upgrade to pro version anytime i hit the unlock button the app will say some error happened 6 please try again later
__label__1 poor replacement for wunderlist so many features missing my day isn't something everyone wants but can't turn off can't reorder my lists manually will use different app when microsoft kill wunderlist
__label__2 good
__label__1 hard to understand setup could not schedule tasks to weekdays does not even show a calendar
__label__4 i would love to do a one life time purchase for this app too bad i hate subscription based so sorry i'd rather spend my money for something unproductive than this app
__label__3 it's a good time planner controller
__label__3 since it can't sync with google tasks i will stick to gtasks app nothing beats the sliding task lists and syncing with gmail sorry i wish this synced it would be the ideal and best of both worlds
__label__3 this just displays your calendar as a time sector whenever you click on it redirects to calendar
__label__5 best habit app i have tried love the flexibility task list and look good job
__label__3 help gps coordinates show up as phone numbers and instead of a location i enter the gps coords in location but in widget it shows the phone and map icons then when you select the event but before edit it shows it to be a phone number i've bein dealing with it but it's getting frustrating bc we use it 3 4 times a day i love the app but this is just getting too much
__label__1 doesnt work the main screen is stuck i can move to the next page
__label__3 i really like the app but you need to fix the reminders they don't work it doesn't pop up on time and sometimes not at all
__label__4 after installing and uninstalling several other apps i finally found this one and it suits my needs the best i like the appearance and all the features there are two things i'm missing however subtasks and the possibility to tick off every single completed task or event for the specific day this would make this app a perfect tool for me and i wouldn't mind to pay for it as a busy mom battling depression i need a simple tool to help me to organise my day and week and to remember my tasks
__label__5 excellent app easy to use and great responsive customer service
__label__2 my wife and i used wonderlist for years to share grocery lists to do's packing lists etc the transition into microsoft to do could not have been more painful duplicate imports and no sharing between work personal accounts made the move harder than it should be but the most frustrating thing i can no longer click and drag to order items in a list i be in the grocery store runnin around like a psycho cuz my list be all scrambled and that's before i even look for toilet paper
__label__3 good but flawed the app does not support tasks from caldav such as icloud reminders
__label__5 i love this app i just wish it wasn't so easy to change your stats and i wish we could delete the default daily tasks maybe i can but i'm a dumbass idk
__label__4 i like but there are some basic features that aren't free
__label__4 pretty good
__label__4 in the important category add option sort by group and list name do the same for the widget it is possibol to have important things from different category so categorising it in important segment make's it cleaner and easyer to track
__label__3 c'est très bien mais ça devrait être moins lourd en daya
__label__5 wow amazing
__label__3 good app but faulty notifications the notifications and reminders were working perfectly but they only work now if i open the app by that point it's too late i need the reminders to work to be effective i purchased the full version
__label__3 i'm using this app for work for due diligence when i first installed the app i was sure i could search my notes for key words now i can't am i doing something wrong or is that function not available on this app
__label__4 a today button would be helpful in the week view widget so that you don't have to scroll back and also the possibility to add more accounts are these features available in the pro version maybe the possibility to try it for a short period of time
__label__1 doesn't import anything from my calendar despite my calendar being ticked as a source so pretty much pointless i'm not double entering everything
__label__4 on android it still won't let me add tasks to top of list where the list actually opens
__label__3 this app is useful but it would be so much more useful if you could set a routine to be repeated every weekday weekend day week 2week 4week month etc it is badly in need of this feature i thought buying pro would allow me to do this and it hasn't helped at all and i'm disappointed i spent the money please say that it is an upcoming feature resetting routines for every day is really inconvenient
__label__3 becoming better and better than before but still can't fully compatible with tasks in outlook on windows looking for to a full functional outlook on android
__label__4 this is a great planner app only thing missing is the ability to rotate into portrait or even rotate 180 degrees
__label__3 great app but whin i installed it and tried the basic feature which is the reminder it doesn't avaliable thats mean you cant also try the reminder i appreciate that becouse no one will give you his work as a free ok i will give it less than 4 becouse i didnt see the main feature which i need
__label__3 two requests please 1 allow the user to set what time the day recurrent tasks reset not everyone's day ends at midnight 2 propagate the theme selected to the widget if i have selected a dark blue theme my widget should have the same dark blue icon s not a bright red habitnow one good so far more customization would make it great thanks
__label__3 ok
__label__1 the app no longer works i gave it 5 stars before and used it religiously every day while supporting the devs as often as possible now when i try to start a new session nothing happens there's a countdown in the notification bar but the app itself doesn't work the big timer in the app is frozen and i'm able to use my phone freely a week ago or so i couldn't complete any session since the timer and the session itself would just reset at some point without me knowing highly disappointed
__label__2 add a feature that let's me tick tasks off from the widget either than that i love the app
__label__2 moved from wunderlist set up to capture non microsoft users it's okay but fails straightforward usability test sigh
__label__5 cool app
__label__5 it is a great app for focusing on something with no distractions definitely recommended
__label__5 i love the ease of use to advance options i get to tailor the appearance and easily create reminder template for future use
__label__4 great app i would rate it a 5 but there's an error where my completed tasks becomes unchecked constantly causing it to keep on becoming an unfinished task and it's annoying
__label__3 i really can't speak to the full experience because i do not have the premium version but so far the free version has helped me with keeping my projects and tasks in one place i am still getting the hang of prioritizing but that is more of a personal thing
__label__1 wow had a 30 second ad that gave me the uninstall this app command i used to like the 1st but eventually moved to the 2nd but after that atrocious ad i uninstalled and used google calendar which the widget is not as nice but works great
__label__5 like the help it gives
__label__5 we are enjoying this app very much thanks
__label__5 really helpful i like that i get reminders in the morning about what's on my agenda for the day i like that i can check them off and they move to the bottom of the lotst as they are completed i like that it reminds me later in the day to revisit my list easy to use
__label__1 dear developer i have paid the amount for pro version after deduction still app is not get updated to pro version i have mail you the same issue asked you to look into expecting immediate responce from you
__label__5 very flexible and the customization is huge
__label__1 nobody use this app read all the forums the app does not support the sync once you've bought premium everyone's saying the same and the devs do not respond to help requests i have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly i am connected to the internet i am a premium user the app is great but please help me with my problem i'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error
__label__4 good app but many paid services
__label__3 continue to get sync error on this app only can use web and see tasks cannot figure out how to fix i've uninstalled this app sever times logged in logged out stopped app cleared cache etc nothing corrects it
__label__4 this application which i used thoroughly and this application seriously deserves 5 stars i have given 4 stars because it don't have multiple user merged account in it which helps our 4 members of family to write their to do in a single place
__label__5 just upgraded to android 10 re evaluating so far so good though pop ups are gone due to android 10 architecture i don't miss them reminders are now handled through the android notifications platform thankfully the multiple reminders feature still works i personally think this is the most important feature that makes this app better than stock calendar apps and even ms outlook
__label__3 monthly and weekly view should be free should also include the option to delete out dated tasks in the recurring tasks category
__label__1 i don't understand why the app has all the languages except the arabic language
__label__1 i use it for awhile then deleted it is take more time to use than other note apps confusing and have no reason to keep it many better note apps out there
__label__5 love that you can have multiple lists and also that you can reorganize the items on your list when you complete an item you can either check it off with an automatic date stamp or swipe it off completely this app has a very easy learning curve and i'm sure it probably has even more cool things that i have not discovered yet
__label__1 this app lost all my data i would sync every day but when i had to reinstall and tried to sync nothing i had paid the money for premium but now it wants me to pay again
__label__1 update 2 okay i think i have figured it out the app doesn't sync with the servers on my wifi but works fine on my data connection weirdly enough the web version works on my laptop using the same wifi please fix update 1 reinstalled app apparently login with google is completely broken not working at all that's why maybe the data is not syncing original no data loads upon startup just a blank screen with 0 health 0 xp and 0 mana
"__label__3 it's crashing everytime i try to tap on 'reminder' thank you it's really 
nice but the reminder part is the most important part for me"
__label__2 this app worked well for a year had ads but i was fine with that the latest update made the ads much bigger appearing in the task sidebar instead of banners at the top and bottom i was annoyed but tolerated it then today i got a full screen video add that i couldn't close until it was through that's too much deleted reply to reply i know i can pay to get them removed but i don't want to support a company that pushes an update with full screen video ads you can't close
__label__2 additionally having to manually go thru and re invite contacts for every task again is not customer friendly really disappointed
__label__2 can't choose when to start i like setting goals habits for advance dates once i'm done with one also you can't edit a habit goal to start over you have to delete and start new doesn't save your previous habits goals to do again
__label__3 awesome app if you could add undo feature if we make any changes to the todo unexpectedly and press back then it saves it and we cannot find what was the original memo
__label__3 it's alright
__label__2 hi i just purchased the pro version for this app but it seems to be crashing
__label__4 works as expected but i would like for time customisation to be more flexible and precise
__label__2 a bad version of wunderlist
__label__4 the app is good and all the only problem is that the reminder does not work
__label__2 i loved this planner for several years with no issues all of a sudden i can't launch the app or create edit an event without getting a noisy intrusive pop up ads i will be looking for a new option possibly even just my stock calendar
__label__4 cool
__label__4 good
__label__3 it is a very good app but it has many glitches the widget requires you to open the app to update and in some occasions even when you check some activities as completed they still appear in your list it is a good app but it doesn't run smoothly
__label__3 this app really is a great idea but for those who dont care about a little digital plant like me it really isnt going to be affective because they wont care if the plant dies im going to try to download it again so i can have a little more discipline but other than that i think it is really nice
__label__4 its a really good app that has helped to motivate me to revise i just wish that you could plant real trees without having to purchase forest premium i also like the design of the app and how easy it is to use
__label__4 edited read second paragraph hi not sure if i'm missing out a setting but the app does not display all the events in a day it makes sense to show only the events in a 12 hr time frame on the clock face but the list of events should include all tasks of the day instead of us having to fast forward the day until the events appear i did not mean tasks poor choice of words on my part i meant that if i have an event at 9pm today and the time now is 6am i will not see this at all the clock face only shows 12 hrs this makes sense the list of events below the clock should probably show events for the whole day though
__label__3 todoist has been a big help for me getting organized and i love using it unfortunately i can only give it three starts due to a problem i've been having for months now long story short my weekly streak doesn't reset when i fail to meet my weekly goal i've contacted their customer support team twice since the problem started and both times i was told they were checking with the dev team followed by silence no explanation or solution
__label__5 i use it everyday and completely love it it is very simplistic to use and understand even for older folks like me if i'm putting together a list of projects i want to get done it's allows me to take a picture or a screenshot then title and save it by category extremely helpful for users of all age groups and with the backup sync features you just can't go wrong with this app
__label__5 amazing
__label__3 while it has helped me be more productive recently the notification settings are bugging out when i tap on 'add notification' and select a louder notification for when i wake up and press done i find out sooner or later than it had reset it to the opener my default notification sound that is quiter this has caused me great annoyance because of this and do not know why this app decided to bug out
__label__5 very useful apps you must try it
__label__2 after recent update notifications messed up sometimes i can't turn it off so it rings until you reset the device
__label__2 task management is terrible it will kill the apps running to draw over the screen frequently my camera shuts off because tick tick notification
__label__3 it's pretty neat helps get things done especially if there's people in your every day life to play and compete with adding a to done list that kept log of the to dos you check off would be cool and adding some sort of actual gameplay with the avatars and the items you gather might be neat too
__label__2 the motivational messages are annoying you can only track up to 5 habits in the free version but it is totally not worth paying for more good riddance i suppo this kind of app is just not for me
__label__5 great app
__label__2 over all good task manager but i do not like misleading and untrue boasts about integration with ms outlook it is possible but only via zappier plus functionality is limited not possible to sync task between this 2apps
__label__2 your app was gud but when i did reset my phone and install this again app doesn't work properly i can do whatever i want it doesn't protect me to other apps if i use other apps while tree is growing they don't die your app is really useless
__label__3 the app's really nice and i really like it but it's just really really buggy for my phone i can't switch between the calendar and tasks with ease i can't even slash out items on the to do list smoothly it could've been such a big game changer for how i do things
__label__3 app is great though some improvements can be done i don't know if it's only me or its the for everyone i am a bit confused with how repeat works
__label__2 set up was glitchy i didnt get further than that it's a great concept though and the art is cute
__label__3 why did u guys eliminate the bushes now for 10 min u get a tree which doesn't motivate me to focus for 25min anymore
__label__3 interesting concept to improve productivity whenever i click on a link and come back to the app i am unable to view contents in the app
__label__5 the perfect planner app i'm so thankful for artful agenda
__label__5 using the free app works for what i need it helps me put down my thoughts of what i need to get done later when they pop into my head when i have the time later i check it and see all the things i normally forget about and get them done sometimes the reminders are annoying and i'm sure they're a way to turn them off but they do remind me to check out what i've out down
__label__2 the widget is buggy every few days it stops showing your lists only removing it and setting a new instance solves the problem
__label__3 good as it is simple and effective it could be more enhanced
__label__1 it was confusing
__label__3 i like this app and what it can do and am pleased with its functionality however having paid for the premium version i find it annoying beyond belief that i get pop ups every 2 weeks asking me to leave a review so developers i've left one but you've lost 1 5 stars for spamming me with these requests this shouldn't happen in a paid app without any opportunity to turn off these notifications
__label__4 nice one
__label__5 it's great showing visual how much time i have and what time i use i needed something like this
__label__1 app broken don't bother like many many other reviewers this app is totally broken and defunct on android devices and specifically galaxy s10 note 10 devices it seems the developer response to all of those reviews is please report a bug but this has now been an issue for months that they haven't looked into fixing despite dozens of notifications from users that their app is broken i have instead now downloaded an app by another developer which actually works i will not be back
__label__5 brilliant and syncs with google home like a gem interface is gorgeous compared to google calendar love the way google calendar and tasks all work together seamlessly
__label__3 ok but doesn't feel too user friendly and kinda weird that the calendar is behind a paywall
__label__2 isn't thanksgiving and christmas considered a holiday am i wrong
__label__4 just started using it the interface is easy to learn and the amount of detail is just robust enough to be appropriate for what i do
__label__4 it s one of the best liferpg apps i have ever seen with lot of options but it can have some more beautiful transparent widgets and if you add an option that a task directly influences a characteristics it can be more comfortable
__label__5 i have gone between this and the google calendar app i like this because it expands the features that are missing in google calendar
__label__3 seemed like a decent enough app but i was looking for a calendar that worked with google but that i could add local photos to events with a feature currently lacking in google calendar without that didn't seem different enough to justify extra install
__label__1 kept crashing rss feed if my calendar duplication of entries was huge and overall it just added to the noise rather than helping i'm out update no i can't send a feedback with log as i've already unsubscribed and uninstalled the app and that's surely something you can add into functionality if you're really interested in gathering the data
__label__4 perfect app but its missing an important tab its already got habits dailies and to do's but it doesn't have a bucket list life goals tab for me it doesn't feel right to put learn a new recipe in the to do tab i also want to put in my goals like focus on getting high grades or get a girlfriend i can't put these in other tabs
__label__1 it was great until it disappeared very unhappy that i lost the app and all my info
__label__3 beautiful widgets in month view i would prefer colored bars with text inside the same as for full day events syncing with ms exchange pros calendar far better then samsung calendar cons tasks completely missing five stars down
__label__3 this app is easy to use but my biggest issue is that when i add notes or check off tasks when off line they dont save
__label__2 now not working after pie emui 9 0 0 please update or give instructions still not working no option found in settings please help as guided
__label__5 my favorite planner
__label__5 does what it says on the label
__label__5 i am a vanilla habitician but that game failed to serve it's purpose several times and i eventually quit i linked it to several systemic errors i was even thinking about creating my own habit rpg free of those but then i found do it now not only it answers all of my concerns it even adds more features like drawbacks for completing certain tasks anti procrastinator or putting player in position where he has to maintain his characteristics amazing thank you devs please port it to web
__label__4 really great app love being able to visualise my day but it would be fantastic if the app and widget could now sync with the systemwide dark mode on android 10
__label__5 this app meshes well with my google calendar
__label__3 still evaluating the app lots of things i thought are not available on free app must upgrade to premium to use app good to use so far that why rating low
__label__3 app is extremely useful just that the search feature doesn't cover all the notes in the app
__label__3 this app is good but i can't access 5 habit because i need premium to access it
"__label__3 you're good guys your efforts are admirable please consider making the app 
available to milions of people and support rtl"
__label__5 i love this app very easy to use and it phelps me to keep track of my progress a
__label__4 this is a great application to view the events in your day easier to see compared to the traditional calendar app one improvement that i would like to see is the ability to see future events by pressing on the widget itself instead of going into the application
__label__3 i have been using the app for some time i guess about 2 years the functionality is very good but here comes the tracker list adcolony applovin chartboost facebook ads flurry fyber google analytics inmobi ironsource mintegral moat tapjoy unity3s ads appgenix says only for the free version check with wireshark in progress
__label__3 it needs a better way to schedule the to do list an easy way to schedule your day week and even month it needs a calendar to see things with a bird eye view i like the game thing but it needs more functions and to be more practical
__label__3 want it to not let me do anything on my phone
__label__4 this platform very good platform anything planning just used to any do
__label__3 i like the concept of the app and the fun gamification of reaching your goals however it is super buggy on android the app is constantly quitting unexpectedly not closing tasks properly and not doing rewards properly i've reported it multiple times now and there has never been any update to fix it i recommend going with another app if you have an android device to save yourself the frustration
__label__1 worst app dont install
__label__3 fix the widget bugs please
__label__3 the task add bar blocks the list if it's too long with no way to scroll down also would like an option to have completed tasks to disappear not just sit there crossed out taking up space and make it easier to share lists with others should be able to accept invites in app not over email
__label__2 i miss wunderlist it was better designed had more style form and function are lacking from this new product i hate you a little
__label__3 this app is really good but i have a major issue with it it helps you focus not to get distracted but sometimes i need to a calculator or google or a dictionary i can't because my tree will die so i need to exit the app the tree is still growing and then i can access google or what not please let the app access certain apps if possible
__label__1 i am going to drop this app after years of use because of recent full page video ads which are out of control edited to add of course the free version has ads always has and i don't mind because something has to pay for app development but these new full page video that can't be shut down in your face for many seconds ads are new and intolerable that was a bad business mistake you can correct i hope you correct it soon i'll be checking back to see
__label__1 dear developers thank you for deleting all my reminders after updating the app it was not pleasant at all believe me
__label__1 no instructions
__label__3 there was no way to set tasks to repeat every day every monday etc
__label__5 i purchased the premium version so i can use the home screen widgets it motivates me to stick to my habbits once i see them all the time when i use my phone i've been using it for 2 3 weeks now and i woke up early went to the gym read at least 20 pages and flossed in the evening everyday obviously is not all thanks to the app but it does help to track my progress and keep me accountable if i miss anything just start with easy to achieve habbits to make it work long term and build on that
__label__2 not a power user with a massive calender of events so i don't need the full blown pro version but there are a lot of basic features under pro only no thanks
__label__3 it's a pretty good app but its has a serious glitch the goal day isn't functioning properly no matter which goal date you set it will always be the same day you created the task like you finished today
__label__3 the only problem i have is that a lot of content in the app including the information and payment gateway regarding premium version is not in english if i can't understand the terms and conditions or whatever i am clicking how will get the correct information about the purchase kindly provide all information regarding pro version in complete english 'only'
__label__3 it didnt sync with the widget overall it great app
__label__2 the app is not working well since the latest update 2 37 0 the app crashes a lot when creating or editing tasks the reminder for tasks and meeting are not working notifications are enabled so that makes the app useless reinstalling the app doesn't solve anything
__label__4 good app effective at reminders easy to use and read looked at quite a few task apps happy i picked this
__label__3 despite lacking a few features i'd love google calendar integration please this is the best to do app i've used it's efficient without complexities that muddy its usefulness the highlight for me is a compact task list widget which allows me to quickly view a large number of tasks on my home screen without scrolling unfortunately a recent update has made its notifications insufferable and i can't turn them off sadly i may have to uninstall and cancel if this isn't fixed soon
__label__3 weather not accurate it would be nice task have options on bottom of calendar too
__label__4 very nice setup thought enough of it to pay for premium couple things add ability to change watch hand colors arms match scheduled event making it impossible to see add ability to increase watch face inner diameter digital time difficult to read watch ticwatch pro 4g phone moto z3 w pie
__label__3 add option to upload to drive
__label__4 i am unable to set sectors properly as shown in your sample screen shots please help
__label__3 decent app fun concept biggest issue right now is that some of the dailies that are supposed to be once per week are still showing up as an every day task which is very annoying sometimes the dailies will cross over into the to do list for an hour or so at a time too
__label__2 i granted this app full access to my google calendar but none of my events show up in the diagram it remains completely empty except for national holidays like national tartan day on april 6th yay i've given this two stars instead of one because this could be awesome the design is great
__label__3 gets a on the phone list of things to do done
__label__4 calendar widget has a glitch when you edit event to repeat it changes the day to a day before example i put my mom's bday on jan 15 all day event and saved then went back in to edit repeat every year and it changed it to jan 14
__label__1 can't get account created tried linking facebook and straight account creation will not let me progress past sign in page
__label__5 brilliant i absolutely adore this app so easy to set up makes using google calendar for agendas even easier than just using google calendars the events on the clock face just clicked instantly for me the fact that they can be colour coded is delightful the widget is great and even shortcuts from there can be personalised i got the pro version even though the free one does everything you need it to having 24 hour option is good though and even more colour customisation now love it
"__label__3 could be a lot better i wish we were able to check off items in our 
routine as we finish them so we can move on to the next task i would also 
like to see a timer associated with the routines so we can see if we are 
falling behind or are ahead of the time we have budgeted i have my morning 
routine but it has multiple tasks within it if we were able to condense 
my tasks into the routine it would make things look more organized all in 
all a very good app if you want to stay organized but i don't think i 
wouldn't use this app until the mentioned points are added if these all 
exist already please let me know because i couldn't figure out how to get 
to them"
__label__3 nice app
__label__1 its really hard to shedule
__label__3 i don't know why but there aren't any notifications it never shows anything let it be reminder or routine
__label__3 its a good app but i think thers some glitch i cant have more than 6 tasks when i create one it just dosen't show
__label__3 subscription based if you want non trivial repeating tasks and no task repeating on completion option either rather pay more upfront uninstalling will stick with toodledo
__label__3 great app however i was not able to sync with google calendar and it was a deal breaker for me uninstalling
__label__1 there is something wrong with the app when the time was up the application would crash and no tree would be planted it used to work before it's too bad the app isny working well now
__label__2 le partage est tres nul cest juste un texte envoyé a l autre
__label__4 good concept but i don't use the app anymore as someone who is now not really a gamer the point game like concept seems to doesn't work for me anymore and maybe it's also due to the fact that i only compete with my self if i were to compete with a friend or whoever that is maybe i can keep my self accountable but that's it to it if you are a gamer this app might gonna help you
__label__3 great app for the most part would be nice if each project a person could list goals till completion as well as being able to have a separate tasks list one for home versus one for work
__label__5 love this calendar i don't know how i remembered anything i had to do before the notifications are so helpful as you can dismiss or snooze for 5 minutes to days highly recommend
__label__2 the interface is great and i love it overall however i'm giving it two stars because it won't synchronize between my samsung phone and ipad despite being the same account information for each i emailed their support like about this and they asked for my login info but i never heard anything back this is a huge inconvenience because i put a lot into the version on my ipad and i dont and wont do it twice for the same application once this is fixed i'll happily increase the rating
__label__3 notifications are great so far
__label__3 it is good but you should add some predefined themes in the palette and not only allow the user experiment
__label__5 simple design
__label__4 this app has helped me be productive with the amount of features it has the only negative i would say is that i would have liked to see the reminders feature included for free
__label__1 i almost tried this when it opened google calendar so i could create a new event im writing this then uninstalling
__label__1 does not refresh on samsung phones i have done every troubleshooting step and more to no avail
__label__2 several navigation options are inaccessible because they're underneath the home back tasks buttons at the bottom or within the notification notch area at the top making this app hard to use on my phone
__label__2 using google pixel 2 and paid for full version sometimes the day on the calendar doesn't update i dont want to have to restart my phone everday a workaround would be to press the refresh button on the calendar but i dont like having to do that every day
__label__2 no ability to add a shortcut widget to quickly add a task meaning it will take several swipes clicks to add a new task on my android phone wunderlist didn't have this constant friction it's a shame that they're shutting down wunderlist without having all of the same functionality
__label__1 2019 10 24 revised from 5 to 1 star app is dead all my data gone never again trust an app you cannot export and organize your data and to a universal format avoid as others said recently
__label__3 can not use custom rutin name
__label__5 this is a very helpful app for those working on time management the home page widget helps keep me on track throughout the day
__label__5 easy to use has many features perfect planner app
__label__1 i am going to drop this app after years of use because of recent full page video ads which are out of control edited to add of course the free version has ads always has and i don't mind because something has to pay for app development but these new full page video that can't be shut down in your face for many seconds ads are new and intolerable that was a bad business mistake you can correct i hope you correct it soon i'll be checking back to see
__label__5 the experience is being great the app is really useful and beyond expectations
__label__3 why did you remove the 'open app' button from the widget this is very very annoying alao new tasks should be inserted on top not at the bottom
__label__1 buggy won't let me edit rewards no
__label__3 all the things that it advertises that it does you have to pay for disappointed
__label__3 it's very nice view but i need also 'to done list' in which feature i can input what i did and review after that myself
__label__5 wonderful
__label__5 really good and super helpful because of covid 19 there's a chance i won't be going to school for a couple months and i wanted an easy to follow routine to factor in my online courses for a minimum of 2 hours didn't do just that but i was actually able to fit in all my chores with more than enough free time to spare i really recommend the app and will definitely be telling my friends
__label__2 i've spent hours on it already and i'm just not getting it looks like most tutorials are for an older version can't figure out how to create shorter than 7 day routines what's the difference between a routine and an event etc
__label__5 good luck
__label__5 user friendly interface with voice commands thats the best feature however it still takes time to add a task by voice as we have to use gui for time and date reminder can i somehow set by default priority to high and reminder to repeat with alarm
__label__4 need to update the calendar more otherwise perfect
"__label__3 i can't get the widget to appear in the background wallpaper screen 
purchased the app only for that feature any help"
__label__1 horrible this stupid thing will not let me log in
__label__1 loaded the trial then emailed about cancelation but email bounced back ended up paying 36 for an app i didn't want no way to contact for refund be careful if you buy this if you try the trial you're stuck paying for it
__label__5 good
__label__3 i cant log in after because i need to add a username i did it but the app froze when i was adding my username and now it seems is taken when it wasn't i tried again with a different one and happened again
__label__3 i just got the app but i can barely use it because every time i click on something it redirects me to a page that asks me to upgrade for 4 99 yr if it would just let me use the free version i might actually like it
__label__5 good app it helps me be motivated without hesitation nor procastination thank you habitnow your love aliff
__label__1 won't sync with my calendar sam note 10
__label__5 good
__label__3 widget doesn't work
__label__3 i have been using forest since 2017 and had collected over 3000 coins unfortunately my phone got stolen and i had to buy a new one now when i reinstalled the app it's saying that i need to start collecting again and to log in i need a premium account which i have never had how can i get my points back thank you
__label__3 nice app but can be improved upon in terms of navigating the app
__label__2 i think the free version of the app has some good capabilities but lacks some functionality that i desire functionality that i'm not sure exists in the paid version due to the lack of support for the product i was unable to find where i could go to ask questions thus the 2 star rating
__label__2 dissapointing in some few days it can' t be open i already download it for two tines and nothing change please fix this one
__label__5 user friendly nice
__label__2 no longer the calendar i use since the intro of annoying ads and video ads uninstalled
__label__1 microsoft took a well designed application and made it practically useless
__label__5 can you give an option to set up timer for every task like 10 minutes or so to make us more efficient you can do it by giving us a button to start the timer and the task automatically gets checked once the time is up and if somebody wants to undo then points will be deducted is it possible in any way
__label__5 i absolutely love this app i am a very ocd person when it comes to being organized and love my planner but really wanted something digital very portable and environmentally friendly i found it here i love the way it syncs in seconds across my devices phone ipad google home device and laptop it s super user friendly and very customizable i tried several other digital planners and this one beats them hands down
__label__2 in this app reminder doesn't work
__label__4 it is a good app really ok but i don't like that you oblige me to rate this is a no go
__label__5 good set of features works well only wish i could display tasks or reminders on the calendar without a time duration
__label__3 not quite as good as wunderlist for me but overall decent and as i need to use this for work now as wunderlist blocked i am trying to get into it broadly premium features seem quite pricey
__label__1 be aware if you purchase the paid version and then try to cancel within the 14 days trial you won't be able to they only reply once a day if you contact them and every time you contact them you have to explain that you want to cancel the service making the days passed by and after a while they just stop replying back using these shady tactics to make the 14 days goes by so you can't cancel after that this company is a joke
__label__2 the widget is buggy every few days it stops showing your lists only removing it and setting a new instance solves the problem
__label__3 great app but it never archived old chores so didne let points
__label__5 simple and intuitive i don't even know for sure how long i've been using ticktick but at the time i tried multiple free to do list apps and this one was by far my favorite it allows my tasks to auto reset on a schedule of my choice i get reminders for the day but can also set reminders ahead of time down to a specific time of day if preferred
__label__5 love at first use hope this keeps getting much cooler and hope doesnt endup as 30 trial or something we students cant afford you know
__label__4 it is absolutely amazing only as a teenager i have no money to buy the pro version even without the extra features it's awesome although the tags are annoying
__label__4 simple easy to use and very helpful
__label__3 i love the app but please allow me to just buy the app and be on my way what's up with the subscriptions
__label__5 i actually use this app for practicing flute and it helps so much i have tried using normal timers but i usually end up and just pause it saying ill come back later and never do it but with this i can set a timer and it keeps me off my other phone apps and keeps me seated since i cant really pause the timer and its also really nice to see my progress throughout the week for practicing with all the trees that ive planted overall really nice app i highly recommend it
__label__1 i can't get new password it sends message email is not available
__label__3 the best app around for tracking habits but the artificial limitation to 5 habits in the free version coupled with the eye gouging price of the pro version lost it two stars i paid but i am not happy with the price
__label__2 sep 2013 took almost 1 year for decent reminders is still annoying to click twice to view the notes not very productive oct 2019 with new interface the notes disappeared the interface is just a copy of wunderlist or ticktick what is the point of paying a subscription when the competition offers the same functionality reminders and notes for nothing
__label__2 the font size is realy small and you can't change it without paying for the full version large font is a basic accessibility feature it shouldn't cost extra
__label__5 app worked well for me from the start but it took a while to learn how to utilize many of the features my close friends chide me because i add so much to my calendar but the ability to add reminders keeps me on track
__label__4 i love rhat there ia a wodget on my acreen so i can always see which tasks i ahould be working on does the full version connect to your preferred calendar i ahve been using my gmail calendar for years hut i dont see where they sync up
__label__2 nice looking app albeit does not seem to sync with google calendar and not cross platform certainly cannot do 15 yr
__label__5 excellent
__label__4 i use this app everyday to track my errands and tasks i wish it had more features like connection to email and phone even so app is easy to use and keeps me organized
__label__4 it's great in reminding to take my meds want an option to mark tasks as incomplete instead of canceling from list
__label__4 not bad
__label__5 i like this app it is an amazing tool however i couldn't find calendar and where i can track what i have done could you help me find it
__label__2 i set weekly view in settings and for few days the app worked fine but today i tried to go back to months view and i tried to access settings but when i try to do that the app closes
__label__5 love it eventhough we need to learn a little how to use this app but when you get used to it you'll find it very easy
__label__1 i wanted to like it iinitially it looked great but it has such a limited window of time view it's no good for planning a few hours view and that's it scrolling hour by hour day by day useless its sole function appears to be to tell you what you've got coming up in the next few hours which frankly is not much use to anyone as far as i can see cloud cal uses similar circles with a view of the whole month which would be great but sadly the pro version doesn't work so no go there either
__label__3 its ok works for me
__label__3 it seems very nice the inferface can just get pretty overwhelming to look can
__label__5 great
__label__3 i love it but my daily tasks dont reset at midnight so i cant use it in the morning im in western canada what timezones should i set this to so it works for me irs just frustrating not being able to use it for the majority of my day
__label__2 please add option to add voice notes
__label__3 the is good and is really helpful when i plan my day i have problem with the widget that has task and calender problem is if i had a task that had to be done yesterday and i schedule it to do today it doesnot show on calendar tasks but it shows in task list if that could be solved experience using the app will improve
__label__3 free version does what i need with the exception of undelete when accidentally clicking the wrong thing however the cost of pro version too much for just that feature
__label__4 i guess i love it as it kind of works i mean this is as good as an app can get for it's purpose it has the perfect amount of features and completely customizable the biggest problem i have is at the beginning it's very challenging to keep alive as you have no party armour yet and also as far as i'm aware i could only edit the order of the dailies i wish they can be done to other sectors too
__label__3 just a fancy calender widget sure it looks fancy but it doesn't add any functionality it can't do much else it can't track progress
__label__5 i have tried many time managing apps and i like this one the most
__label__1 this app keep on crashing in my device fedup of this app
__label__3 recommend
__label__3 bought the planner pro love the app the down side is that the app did not sync i have 2 device handphone and tablet both android i have to update both device twice instead of once would give 4 or 5 star if it can sync between both device i have some suggestion maybe can input some bill tracker and some cute icon or pill tracker hydration icon
__label__3 needs some adjustments in wunderlist if anyone made any changes to the notes it would be broadcasted to everyone or at least to the person that record within the list belonged to we might just got back to wunderlist
__label__5 this app is perfect for tracking my habits it allows an effective level of depth without being overwhelming i have been using this for several months and i love it the only thing i would like to see would be milestones to increase decrease a habit without retroactively turning past week successes into failures for example increasing a workout habit from 2x wk to 3x wk
__label__3 this app is great but the setting of the aims and the tasks takes a long period of time therefore it eats up your productivity
__label__3 still trying to get used to the app
__label__2 beautiful interface and design unfortunately most features are locked behind a subscription including some important features such as viewing completed daily tasks as is other top rated to do apps offer more features for absolutely no cost would consider paying a one time fee for it but the subscription is a deal breaker
__label__5 this app is great for helping to establish new habits and keep you on track with goals and tasks you want to accomplish
__label__4 this app is really good i want to suggest to that the app should have a rest day option or something similar that you can activate it anytime you want and while activated the tasks will be put into a halt including penalty and overdue it is useful if you are on vacation or there's an occasion you need to attend and makes you unable to finish the daily tasks
__label__5 imporant functions can be used only if you subscribe it would be best if they rather sell this app than make people pay for subscption it's worth their money anyway
__label__2 can do better very complex to handle for newbies
__label__4 it's a great app 4 stars because i think one addition would be a way to have 2 identical widgets running without being connected like 1 widget set for my daily goals tasks shower laundry gym and the second widget for tasks i update and add throughout the day pick up milk get haircut that way i don't get overwhelmed by a single long list but instead have 2 smaller lists i'm a one screen all widgets guy another addition would possibly be a widget calendar list instead of having the 30 day calendar each days events seems useless to have such a huge window of calendar days when i really just need to have a list of events of each day samsung calendar has this widget and it's perfect
__label__2 edit there is some annoying bugs when assigning a date tomorrow is sometimes sent to next week and next week the week after i double checked my datetime settings good tool but removing a star because of the subscription model i would be happy to pay but a monthly fee is difficult to justify by the extra features being offered at least not for my usage
__label__5 love
__label__5 i rarely rate but this app is awesome simple habit tracker with backup option and realy neat habit display
__label__1 the features and functionality are pretty good with support for google tasks but the homescreen widget doesn't load at all on android 9 after restarting the device one has to remove it and reinstall it which is a pain and the support team was not helpful at all they went from suggesting a solution which suggested they didn't understand their own app to being completely unresponsive
__label__2 i couldn't get past the set up 'strength is not valid enum value path 'attitude'
__label__3 it takes me about 2 3 seconds to switch between events and tasks tabs can you make it faster somehow p s app is great just what i need schedule and to do list in one
__label__3 i love the app but please allow me to just buy the app and be on my way what's up with the subscriptions
__label__3 i'd love to see class selection as an option when you start the game i was forced to be warrior without an option to change i even went to setting and nothing there to change it either
__label__1 very disappointed about the recent update i had everything work fine till the update scrambled everything
__label__2 doesn't go to portrait
__label__2 this does not work the same as wunderlist when i sort i cannot manually move items to in effect do a sort alphabetically within priority also when i prioritize items they don't automatically move to the top of the list with wunderlist going away i am going to have to search for a new app so disappointed
__label__4 really helped me to level up my organizing and productivity i wouldn't need all the premium features really tho
__label__5 really useful easy to use
__label__1 ad heavy plus unable to use widget and stock calander app
__label__3 it's useful but the recurring task feature is a pain in the free version
__label__2 the new interface is cluttered and hard to use edited in response to the query below in the older interface a routine had a separate page for each day of the week now it's a continuous scroll the older approach seems cleaner
__label__4 great addition to having a calendar i can set text reminders for to dos from here so i don't have to clutter my family's digital calendar with details for my days took a while to get how the app and folders work but i have a good system set up now
__label__2 task notifications have stopped working
__label__5
__label__4 overall good and useful i'll likely continue to use and i would like more control of reminder sounds including repeating so i don't miss it and sounds without needing to open app maybe there are settings i can adjust also more integration with other apps including trello and evernote and more a general multi app share feature would be great as is i am copying and reentering things in multiple apps and i want to just send them
__label__2 not a single event appointment meeting etc is showing up going to uninstall after rating
__label__5 literally used this app for the last 4 years love it it does way more than any of the calendar apps on the market i would recommend to any one secret feature you can privately link contacts to tasks and appointments so you can easily have their info on hand
__label__4 i love that i can break a task into steps i didnt like that they moved the completed task button from the bottom of list to side menu all in all it is a good tool and it has improved a lot since i started using it
__label__5 issue solved after update 5 stars
__label__3 the app idea is quite great the app itself needs to be improved thought the clock keeps getting stuck on fixed times and updates the time only when we open the app itself this defeats the whole purpose of the app definitely a 5 star idea needs better execution
__label__3 great app better than google's free one but paying a subscription for such a simple app has rendered this useless im happy to oay a one off fee but im not willing to pay a subscription just access other features hence why its not 5 stars its just a to do list thats all
__label__3 how can i set a task to repeat daily or weekly
__label__3 i'm changing my review from 5 to 3 my husband uses the same app for his work and private events so i also bought this however for some reason and we've already tried every troubleshooting we can think of his calendar private calendar won't show up on mine although it does show up on google calendar i've tried reinstalling so many times but to no avail only very few events of his would show up on my calendar and not the whole thing i'm not sure what's going on
__label__1 the app itself gets the job done but it will not sync and the developer is not responsive to questions don't waste your money with premium you won't get what you pay for
__label__1 i would give 5 if bug is fixed it automatically opens showing black and unresponsive app pop up when it is not actually opened please fix this is for samsung s10e
__label__3 i update to latest version and notification sound won't stop i saw in log its already fixed so i try to reinstall couple of times but still the same i'm not always around or have the phone on my hand all the time to make it stop considering to download older version instead
__label__1 real tress can be planted using paid version of the app so why should i download this free fake version
__label__5 if you want a digital checklist to keep you on top of your life then this is the app to use
__label__5 i love all of the features especially the lists and the stickers
__label__2 lost the ability to sort to dos by tags very inconvenient i used that feature a lot
__label__3 don't want to subscribe
__label__5 honestly it's perfect but theres just one thing i really wish you could set a habit for 'complete x times a week' it would be so useful i have yet to find an app that is this good but that is the only shortcoming please add this i mean of course you dont have to but it would be amazing
__label__2 no option for reminders it doesn't show reminders of my google calendar and i dont wanna create events for my daily habits lol
__label__4 this app is awesome could use better graphics but overall the idea of it is legit af
__label__5 great app i suggest that you will add a calendar view feature sychronized with the created tasks so that users can visualize their tasks thanks in advance
__label__4 great concept has me waking up on schedule and doing my tasks so i dont loose life and earn exp just one thing i cant do quests i got the dust bunnies quest but i have no clue what to do with it help
__label__2 please add the option of automatically adding tasks to the top instead of forcing them to the bottom that's the only thing stopping me from switching over from wunderlist edit i just heard you're killing off wunderlist for good in may of 2020 i know i'm just one person but i'll be jumping ship if such a simple improvement isn't made edit again 3 27 and you did an update but why in the world would you give ios the add tasks to the top feature but not android come on please
__label__2 i purchased the premium version and now i can't buy new plants errors keep happening and i would like to go back to the free version without loosing my forest i have the newest version so it should be so glitchy once it's fixed it will get 5 stars
__label__2 i was willing to give this a try to see if it suits my needs seemed ok with limited use so far the only thing more annoying than constant notifications from apps is at 9am when my phone vibrates and any do takes over the whole screen and asks me to plan my day i don't need it taking over things i will plan when i want are you seriously doing this it is the equivalent of a browser popup and very annoying
__label__3 works great except for you have to have upgrade to be able to have more than five habits
__label__3 microsoft forces you to use your microsoft account to use it then never keeps you logged in long enough to get notifications sharing via text feels like i'm back on my droid phone and trying to get updates to shared lists suffers from the forced log outs as well also can't customize smart lists that are stuck at the top my day and tasks that's the same thing for me either let me put it at the bottom or let me remove them microsoft took wunderlist and ruined it
__label__3 it has great promise but i cant use it offline so its worthless to me
__label__4 pros i loved the visual representation of events and integration with google calendar cons it isn't integrated with google tasks most of the users would use tasks to track their activities along with calendars i would love to purchase the pro version and rate it 5 stars if integrated with google tasks
__label__3 as a to do list it works ok devs need to allow manual sorting of priority though i think this app has much greater potential if it were to be integrated with outlook including meetings appointments along with tasks becoming more of an overall assistant rather than a to do list one major gripe though the point type on the widget is miniscule and barely readable
__label__4 great app help i unfortunately forgot my password i was very sure it's correct but i'm not sure why it says it's wrong is there anything that can be done about it
__label__3 so disappointed to lose everything i didn't realize the app didn't save your lists got a new phone and everything transferred but because this app doesn't have you log in everything is gone i had several important lists saved to prepare for my upcoming baby and it's all gone i'll never remember it all time to look for something else to use response from the main screen i didn't see any prompting so did not know i was supposed to or how to
__label__1 i have premium app sync is not working no repply from developer just waist of money
__label__5 i've been looking for an app that can do what habitbull does and i'm so glad i finally found it it's a great easy to use app and the messages you get are so cute
__label__4 pros i loved the visual representation of events and integration with google calendar cons it isn't integrated with google tasks most of the users would use tasks to track their activities along with calendars i would love to purchase the pro version and rate it 5 stars if integrated with google tasks
__label__3 i was hoping for similar to notes app on iphone not even close but i prob don't know how to use it
__label__4 plz 1 widget that shows the current date list of upcoming events 1 click option to open calendar 2 ability to set reminders alerts for scheduled events 3 ability to sync to phone's stock calendar android 4 additional settings ability to customize the color of the circle indicating current date 5 ability to actually see the inspirational quotes in the app even if a new tab was necessary 6 ability to create tasks and designate their priority as high low or routine along with the option
__label__2 having trouble syncing on new device says there is no internet connection but my connection is strong
__label__3 i am apple transfer and i am yet to find am app for android with the same functionality as the built in ios app this one is ok but does not do what i need it to literally all i want an app to be able to do is have reminders pop up when scheduled then stay on the screen until they are completed this app will make the reminder pop up when scheduled but if i don't complete it by the end of the day it will not stay on my screen seems like i have to try and find a different app
__label__4 very good productivity booster
__label__1 unskippable pop up video adds with sounds awful and completely inappropriate for 'business' as the name suggests i shall look forward to deleting this app and avoiding this developer from now on
__label__5 simply an excellent app in every way hassle free and very easy to use
__label__5 the more i use this app the more i love it i've been looking for something like this for a long time one thing i'd like to be able to sort my routines chronologically rather than alphabetically
__label__2 so far so good bit expensive having to purchase a yearly basis to access basic functions as color tags and what comes with it translation to greek is not fluent for the price tag annually i would apprechiate developers look closer at them will give it a try before committing on purchasing it per year on a positive note love the widget using however nova launcher current rating will change based on the experience
__label__1 screw you m uninstalled
__label__1 forcing to open microsoft account even when we are providing mobile number or another email account i don't understand if it is very good app and useful then i will open account
__label__2 seems like it could be fun i just had a hard time getting into it
__label__4 сам сервис очень крутой но пожалуйста сделайте более понятный интерфейс для habits пусть они они становятся серыми или изчезают когда человек отметил свой прогресс за день я банально не помню отмечала я свой прогресс сегодня или ещё нет а показатель в виде цифры или зелёного рыжего цвета мне ни о чем не говорит
__label__1 bought the premium version long ago but now it has ad on it
__label__3 starting maybe in september i've started having issues i will add an event to the calendar which is synced to google but within a few days the event will get cancelled w out notice of course i can appreciate that the problem stems from google sync nonetheless the problem is serious as it has to do with the chore use of the application anyway i personally still use the app as the visualisation is still way better than google's so for me that still beats the major con
__label__4 really helpful app but there's one problem you can leave the app by clicking the home button and your tree keeps growing while you do other stuff on your phone which means it doesn't really prevent you from leaving the app hope this is fixed because i really like this
__label__3 notes and tasks are appearing twice
__label__4 i really loved it as i studied my plant would grow just the problem was that if i wanted to unlock a package of grow real trees or get knowlage about trees i had to purchase it that is why i have a problem in the app well if the app is for studying then why are you have made a purchase deal i don't think this is fair pls try to get rid of this purchase
__label__3 the notification nor alarm won't work
__label__4 tells me tomorrows activities are overdue today
__label__3 note 10 plus buffering issues timeline feature and the coin sign cause the app to go into buffer mode so those features eventually are unavailable
__label__4 i just started but really like it so far competes directly with habitica but less of the nonsense costumes it's hard at first to sort characteristics skills and tasks you are essentially your own game dev but on paper i recently sorted out what i want to improve skills and what is stopping me characteristics tasks will follow soon after i'm really hopeful about this setup i love the design and i never do this but i might actually pay for a subscription if all goes well
__label__4 very good if a little hard to navigate would recommend
__label__3 the full screen ads are intrusive and seriously hinder the free version's usability before the ads this was a very solid and handy calendar app
__label__3 i would give 5 stars if it had the feature to rearrange the items with your specific order instead or being predetermined
__label__4 works with home assistant
__label__5 great experience
__label__5 i think it serves the purpose very well as a todo list with reminder categories functions user interface is user friendly too thanks
__label__5 awesome
__label__1 terrible can't control whether things repeat it not and a study task is automatically a habit stupidly paid for the premium upfront agree with others that idk where 4 6 came from
__label__4 easy to use and i love the daily prompts to get things done even when i have not scheduled anything
__label__2 got it primarily for reminders it has a lot of settings for how you want your alarms or notifications but those are pretty useless when they don't work didn't get a single notification to remind me of the stuff i set up
__label__4 it really helps me for studying and keeps me in focus i also likes to grow many trees in my forest so i study by keeping the timer on and at the end i have studied than i thought and many beautiful trees are too grown
__label__3 it does not have the ending time of an event
__label__1 this app deleted my whole google calender
__label__5 so far best alternative to wunderlist i've found works for my brain great features ad free synch thank you to the developers for making all essential features free
__label__1 update dropped 5 star rating to 1star app will not sync i have it on android and ipad and neither one of them will sync to the server app store shows 8 months since any updates would not have paid for premium if i knew it wasn't going to be maintained original review i wanted to make something like this myself but they've already done a great job i feel more obligated to the daily habits i'm trying to build and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks
__label__3 i love this app and use it for everything however for some reason it is no longer showing any holidays when i clicked on that tab hopefully this will be fixed in the next update
__label__3 it would have been better if it kept its own database rather than relying on the calendar i don't want to put trivial things to plan my day in my calendar uninstalling
__label__2 i really love this app but i can't find any way to make it work on my new huawei y7 phone i've followed all the instructions in the faq and tutorials online but my trees still continue to grow regardless of whatever other apps i'm using i hope this compatibility issue is possible to fix and that it gets fixed soon because i absolutely love this app otherwise
__label__5 does exactly what i need it to do you can see habit streaks daily reminders for habits that day percentage of habits completed
__label__3 i newly use hope it will be good
__label__3 please build ifftt integration so that any trigger can cause habit to be set as done up counted
__label__3 please make weekly view free for every device
__label__3 not free
__label__2 i've loved using this calendar for years my favorite feature is the bar view in the month calendar i haven't found any other calendar app that does it this well but recently they ruined the free version by showing full screen pop up ads that play for up to 15 seconds before you can get back to your work i may have paid for the full version before they did this but not now if they're going to force uses to pay up 7 to remove such intrusive ads i'll just move on to another app
__label__2 in this app reminder doesn't work
__label__3 its db un to use
__label__1 it wont let me login at all my old miceosoft password never is used so i tryed to use me current one for my gmail and it wouldnot work
__label__4 i came across from wunderlist and it does everything i need it to do except for one really annoying feature on wunderlist when you added a new item you had the option for it to go to the top or bottom of the list i always want my newest entries to go to the top especially in very long lists as they are the things i want to action first include a simple option to allow this and your app will do everything wunderlist did and i will be a happy man
__label__3 achievements are not loading anymore
__label__1 very glitchy never even got to use the app because it constantly crashed and said it had connection issues
__label__4 this platform very good platform anything planning just used to any do
__label__1 thanks to the developer for your quick response however this calendar is useless for our group without those features we decided to go with business calendar pro previous comments wasn't able to see month or year view
__label__2 expensive
__label__2 if i log in to to do then i get logged out if outlook when i log back into outlook i get logged out of to do i cannot use both if you had just kept tasks in outlook we would not need 2 apps
__label__4 it's a bit hard to set everything up but it's a fun new concept for the typical agenda that encourages you a bit more to achieve your goals through a rpg style nice work dev team thanks for your time and effort
__label__5 nice app good layout and design one request add tracking as well to the tasks then it will be complete solution along with setting up tasks i need to track as well which tasks i have done today weekwise and monthwise
__label__3 not able to show the notification after the time is up also it is not able to function well on counting the exceeded time or shown incorrectly it would be of great help if you could fix the problems thank you
__label__3 good app but i like wunderlist better microsoft should have changed the name of wunderlist to microsoft to do added their integrations updated the program inline with user requests and it would be great the my day feature is odd since i plan my day the night before so my day events are gone the day i actually need them i don' use my day any longer instead i use important and planner as a replacement for my day and i use task as an inbox
__label__2 not sure why everyone's given this such high reviews the reminders don't work for me which makes the whole point of having this app useless
__label__2 cannot use because of the 299 entry limit my most important list was split into 7 lists the first list segment is full so i cannot add a new entry to the top of it i copied my lists from wunderlist and several lists got split like that if it had copied starting at the bottom of the list so the first segment was the one not full i might have been able to make it work
__label__2 i wanted to use this app the concept is really good but i won't use it simply because it barely functions for starters it's online only but as if that wasn't enough the sync on android is just all over the place the app would sometimes ask have you done these things today for tasks that were scheduled the day before or at 1 am for tasks on that day speaking of tasks i couldn't set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week per task wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them for some reason they would all sync to same weekdays i enabled reminders but never had a reminder come up once and as far as i researched online this is a common problem on android and hasn't been resolved for some time so it seems i have to create a habit of opening this habit tracker app
__label__5 i really like how this app is working it's easy to use and routines are very useful i had little problem and i got a response in one hour so thank you for the help
__label__3 no longer syncs with alexa useless for my needs edit thanks for the response i'll raise it by two stars in the benefit of doubt hope amazon solves your issue fast as alexa is integral to your lists
__label__5 i've tried many to do list apps and this one is the best so far and is helping me with getting more productive with life and school work
__label__5 if you don't do any event today it will not move to next day automatically you have to manually click on event and give time and date again i have to use task for this i got it it's good if time of tasks can also be shown on widget thanks
__label__5 cannot log in
__label__3 hi i change start day of week in the sitting but in the repeat option when i check the skip weekend the program skip saturday and sunday if first day of week is saturday then thursday and friday are weekend please fix it for 5 stars this is very important thanks
__label__4 the most effective way to organize and follow your tasks it is brilliant the only downside is that it does not have desktop version i hope they will fix this gap soon
__label__5 good
__label__2 it's useful but it doesn't fully sync the events tasks and notes between devices it's a huge inconvenience besides that i still love the app
__label__2 suddenly with ads and paid content disappeared synchronization has some issues
__label__3 it is an okay app but it keeps logging me out once a few weeks for some reason
__label__2 it's a fine app but logs me out every other time i go to use it
__label__4 it's a great app almost providing everything you want for free not like other apps i just wish if there was a timer beside each task you do such that you can spend tasks more efficiently and switch between them anyway great job guys
__label__3 nice but i wish it had more flexibility
__label__4 i love this game it has helped me do much it's a bit of a learning curve it would be nice if challenges were visible from the app in all of the guilds and i would also like to see the last day and time that a habit was marked because the colors don't always change and if you have a lot of habits it gets confusing otherwise this app is brilliantly done and will be getting my monetary support in whatever way i can afford
__label__5 i love this app it never crashes or loses my data the collaborative features are great this is the only task managment app i recommend
__label__4 i like it but sometimes does not response correctly and need more options to do the daily use easier
__label__5 started using habitica on january 1st of this year as a new year's resolution to manage my time and habits better and it's been a huge help especially love the party aspect and the way it adds social accountability to missing or hitting targets very pleased thank you for all the work that went into this app
__label__1 update 11 02 20 use at your own risk as expected no contact from developers app has not been updated since 2018 this app was great for a month until it kept freezing my phone a de reinstall has now lost all my data and looking at other users with this issue it looks like it is lost forever because of the sync function never working and no contact from developers very upset and disappointed
__label__3 it doesnt seem to be possible to delete a single event in a series so if i want to block off an hour every day for the same thing but then i have to schedule a one off thing during that time i can't just delete one occurence and leave the rest of the future occurences alone i love the app otherwise but this problem is pushing me toward a different app
__label__5 i use this app to track various symptoms of my ibs i also tried habithub and loop but only this app allowed me to track on a daily basis how many times a certain symptom occurred and also set goals based on either no more than and no fewer than a given number of occurrences i preferred the interface and graphs i'd like to see a chart of raw numbers instead of just pass fail in some of the other apps but from a purely functional standpoint this is the one to beat
__label__3 its not working in my op6 properly i am not able to access the full functionality of task in notification area looks like a bug
__label__5 i'm trying to develop some healthy habits and this app is very good at reminding me to do things the only complaint i have is that you can't actually organize your tasks and habits i try to organize them by time and they don't move i have a habit for 12pm listed after one for 3am which is preceded by 4pm this is very frustrating when you want to look at things in order that's why i'm docking 1 i like the function of it and i like the widget update 1 restored thank you for helping
__label__5 great way to track tasks reminders priorities repeating tasks are hugely helpful to keep me on top of what needs to be done
__label__4 great task and project management app user friendly and versatile lists and sub lists work well for most to do list requirements would just recommend to developers to introduce a couple of improvements 1 there should be a difference between the date you plan to do a task and its deadline due date 2 would be great to be able to add a description and deadline to a sub list thereby creating little projects
__label__3 it's a great idea the options need more explanation i can't tell what half of them do also the widget while very useful it doesn't update properly it falls hours behind and doesn't update unless i run the app and hit refresh sometimes
__label__2 i re installed this app last week and it's been great but recently it won't plant the tree when i press plant it shows the countdown in notifications but the actual app keeps showing the planting screen with nothing happening which kinda defeats the purpose of the app
__label__2 the only thing that is missing is to open specified event after click on a widget for now i can give for stars i'll give more when this feature will be available edit after upgrade adding widget to homescreen only allocates place but is invisible when it finally showed up it doesn't have promissed functionality
__label__1 i have been using the app from the last 3 years i am a premium user when trying to sign in a new device and sync it's not syncing i need my data please help with this issue even after reaching to the support team tonnes of times no one is responding so i am changing the rating from 3 to 1
__label__5 lovely just a question can we have a desktop version is there any plan
__label__5 i can't say enough good things about the app and the dev and support teams super stable lots of great features and the most responsive support team i've worked with personally or professionally invest in this app you'll love it and you'll support a company that is doing app development right
__label__3 needs more features but i just started using it so i'll let u know specifics soon
__label__5 wonderful
__label__3 i currently use wunderlist to organize all my tasks it would be nice to have integration with their software because g tasks is so bare bones also because of the limitations of the free software i can't tell if the full version would integrate into my workflow because this app prohibits use of projects
__label__4 crashes when i customize my hero status
__label__5 ok
__label__4 it is a good for organising daily task n making habit
__label__4 excellent app for time management and routines i love how customizable tags are and how versatile the difference between routines and events are i just wish there was a deeper google calendar immersion so that i could edit icons and add tags to imported events
__label__3 i would stick to this if only the event preview text is not cropped
__label__4 i got many work many problem but with this this app can give me something new i can manage my daily activities this is my solution live for me
__label__1 it does not transfer files from wunderlist the status is always importing from wunderlist but nothing happens
__label__4 the app is good and in general highly customizable but it has one flaw it uses days 24 hours periods as a basic unit of measure but it doesn't let you change the default starting hour midnight this is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night i would rate it as a 5 stars app if i could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly
__label__2 the latest update is poorly designed for users with lots of tasks completely changes the old interface with attending bugs out of the blue biggest fan to dead in the water overnight shocker
__label__4 app ui is very good when i see my today tasks i see all the tasks but i only want to see my today tasks list like todo list app need another feature mean automatically overdue notification when i cannot complete my today which tasks i know that your reply but i think it's actually perfect example on todo list
__label__3 stop looking at users as cash cows i will be uninstalling this and moving to a different app which is as good and does not nag this is quite a good to do app other than that it too often comes up with prompts to upgrade to the premium subscription based version since when have customers disrespectfully greedily been treated as cash cows it used to be apps were 5 at most for a lifetime of use but now they are greedy and arrogant enough to want 5 or thereabouts per month i wud pay a one off
__label__5 very versatile app i used this primarily as a to do list and grocery list
__label__2 it would be a 5 review if it weren't yearly payment put it a one time payment and i'll be the first one to buy it this really ruined it for me
__label__3 coming from wunderlist i am disappointed so much wasted space in the user interface and no way to make elements smaller the overall look is also less slick it really is a to do app while i'm looking for a listing app will have to find an alternative
__label__3 while i love this app there are a few things that i would like to see before i can give it five stars the first being i would like for a right click to work the same as a long press so that the app can be used on chromebooks comfortably
__label__5 i hardly ever leave reviews but had to make an exception here app is colourful looks great and easy to use love the ability to add sub tasks and set reminders nearly all features are free to use with no ads massive props goes out to the dev also never seem a dev so active in the reviews section helping users and taking suggestions on board very well done
__label__1 bought the paid version and added various tasks on desktop won't even log me in or load anything downloaded the app to access my tasks and shows nothing i even paid for premium very dissatisfied and disputing through my bank this is worst than free apps like keepnote seriously disappointed
__label__3 nice looking app though no google sync
__label__5 it's very good it helps me more about my difficulties in habits tracking i found it best of all
__label__4 very cool app
__label__5 although limited still useful
__label__5 simply one of the best applications that must be in every time manager's mobile
__label__4 great app like the options of multiple routines calender and reminders however i wish there was more control over the routines i'd like to be able to pick the start of my day instead of it starting at 12am i'd also like to be able to pick what week days for a routine to be active so i can have different routines each day you can manually program it if you pay for pro version but it's a hassle to go day by day if the routine is going to be used for months
__label__2 it doesn't show reminders not much useful without reminder display support
__label__2 the biggest downside of the app is that you now need a microsoft account google single sign on isn't possible
__label__3 the best looking todo app i could find very complete would be the one i use but unfortunately sync with google calendar takes hours up to a day the issue seems to be a couple of years old you can check it in the customer section on their website and nothing was done to address it while the competition syncs in seconds if you don't need google sync then it's great i'm now using another app sad
__label__3 all i needed is calendar that has a loud reminder alarm system such that one's event cannot be skipped even if u slept off but most unfortunately ur reminder only bips once a small sound that one will easily miss even while holding the phone almost no sound at all pls could it be settings issue or what i need solution pls that i may come back n give u 5 i use camon cx
__label__3 its honestly a great app other than the fact that it keeps pushing for me to upgrade and i cant do certain things unless i upgrade
__label__3 it helps tho but i can't access premium account even if i had enough load credits in my phone network
__label__3 nice app
__label__5 i love this app i can literally organize my entire life with this app and not worry about it i make grocery lists set reminders for appointments create subtasks and this isal all with the free version if i need to make other arrangements i can do that with a few adjustments with the date and time this is the first app i've seen in several years that may be worth the paid version just what i need
__label__4 pretty good app that helps me stay organized could use a few improvements but overall i enjoy it
__label__5 excellent app for managing your task list
__label__4 beautiful plants
__label__2 too complicated to save and add
__label__3 please can you integrate with outlook calendar
__label__3 i don't like a widget with the monthly calendar plus events plus task that monthly calendar is too big and unnecessary i would like to have the option to watch a widget just with the date the events and tasks something symple as if we can watch it in the application the same would better in the widget when they change it i'll give the 5
__label__4 awesome app to keep your life on track would 5 star but app crashes every time i try and add a custoum sound edit thank you will try again after the next update
__label__3 hmmm working good
__label__3 app has been useful in helping me keep track of tasks and all but lately the alarms i set on my dailies haven't been going off at all which is unfortunate because they're all to remind me to eat
__label__3 3 of 5 stars that's all
__label__5 i love this habit app and the customization ootions i use it to track exercise and also build up break habits im trying to start stop
__label__4 really nice i just this to get ready in the morning and to focus at work i've not been late since i started and i'm loving it i don't like that you can't turn the vibrate off
__label__5 perfect app best app ever i really love it
__label__1 just basic app without any exciting features why i pay for this useless app please don't download it's a cheat waste of time and energy
__label__3 it would be nice if there was a warning what certain buttons do i was trying to figure out how to change the day from day one clicked clear day and it erased my entire schedule it should say clear routine if that's what it does i'm a little pissed as i just paid for the app so i can make a schedule still unsure of how to do what i need
__label__3 decent app my major problem with it is that i heavily use the app widget from the home screen but the widget is so buggy and it hides all my tasks randomly
__label__5 my love for nature and need for concentration has made this app the best choice while i work
__label__2 great app that suffers from the most annoying design flaw every time i create a task it goes to the bottom of the list i always want the task at the top so i can see it that's the whole point of using a to do list so i have to drag the task one by one to the top makes me crazy
__label__3 i would buy if there was one time only purchase i can't pay monthly and it's still enough to use without premium but i want premium and one time purchase
__label__3 give me the best observation time
__label__4 extremely easy user interface helpsnin using the app more and note the goals
__label__1 i had a premium scam the app is very pushy and annoying i couldn't get into 80 of my incoming calls as it blocked the screen so the call doesn't appear on the screen you only hear it and hopelessly looking for the call screen that you only get once the call is dropped you have to call back then disturbing and annoying i barely used this app as to maintain it takes a lot of time i asked them to cancel they said they will not refund as more than 48h passed of yearly subscription
__label__3 my friend loves this app but its not for me
__label__1 notifications only come up when you come app
__label__3 it would be nice if they had the option to list tasks from top down instead of down up where your first task is at the top instead of at the bottom
__label__4 good app
__label__4 this sponsors exactly what you want it to do also love the colours and reminder options
__label__2 the new notifications are useless to me i always keep my phone on vibrate and the old normal android notification would vibrate my phone and notify me on my watch too but now the new notification pops up silently and is very easy to miss and i've tried changing the settings and nothing works i really don't understand why not use android's build in notifications instead of this new thing or why is there no option to turn it off
__label__2 windows 10 version made my computer freak out uninstalling for now
__label__5 awesome
__label__2 since recent update adverts make the free version absolutely unusable i understand some adds have to be in the free version but full screen adds are very disruptive in a calendar app when one needs to work quick otherwise the functionality it great
__label__3 i hope i can change the template instead of this morning or tomorrow morning
__label__3 could do with a reward or goal feature when habit followed
__label__5 this is quite frankly the best to do app i've ever used it has features i didn't even know i needed like searching for tasks or the my day tasks list it syncs really well and worked even better than i'd hoped great job
__label__2 fair enough for ads but now the widget isn't showing anything anymore it's just blank i've set up all events and schedule and it's still blank
__label__1 i couldn't even sign with android it kept saying the password is wrong i ended up changing the password and still didn't login wasted an hour
__label__5 have had this app for sometime and find it does everything i need both as a retail manager and my home life able to customize to suit individual needs no hesitation in recommending
__label__2 hi developer need to improve note module it fix only for protrait view which is when i'm using landscape view tablet with keyboard i need to adjust my head or the gadget tq
__label__2 i keep completing tasks and the next day they open automatically again and the notification pops up its very irritating and confusing what's the point of opening a completed task maybe you need to add an option to permanently close repeat tasks vs close them for that day
__label__3 potrebbe essere interessante ma molto lontano da wunderlist e' molto tempo che è partito il progetto e non capisco come non si sia riusciti a catturare le cose positive di wunderlist ed inserirle in questa nuova app delete è troppo definitivo creare un trash per recuperare le note e magari con cancellazione a tempo ho scaricato anche la versione desktop ed ha dei problemi che vado a segnalare al momento la tengo in stand by in attesa di verificare le future release
__label__5 so easy to use really help me who's such an untidy person there's a pomo and really help me to count how much time that i've spent in one session
__label__3 everything thing is customizable but there is no timer i want timer for every sub task that i create every single task i do i want a time and daily stats for the same need to download some other providing the same for now when you include this mail me i will download again
__label__3 it's really confusing its hadd to make routines and stuff just over all really confusing but over great way to track routines i love the tag idea mabey you should add a default school tag
__label__3 it's a useful app have maybe some things to improve like the habit set up is not very clear or intuitive
__label__3 it's an okay app but i have found better ones such as i am sober this needs to be paid for to be useful
__label__1 i consider it as not easy to use
__label__1 would love to actually get started with this app but for whatever reason i can't even build my avatar none of the options for selecting what i want my avatar to look like actually show up on the screen they're all completely invisible
__label__3 nice app
__label__2 this app was exactly what i was looking for a visual of the day in clock form only issue is if i add something to the clock it adds it to my calendar i don't want that i want an app where the calendar and app are separate this was supposed to be for studying and exercise i didn't want to have to add those things as into my ready packed calendar it was a fast uninstall iif there was an option to disconnect the two i'd reinstall
"__label__3 i love the idea of this app is quite unique in the way it visually shows 
my upcoming events sadly try as i might i can't get it to refresh 
correctly with my calendar its always wing despite following all the steps"
__label__3 very useful great clock widget with my schedule it is better if can open calendar app by touched widget
__label__1 only 7 day trial not sufficient a month would be better
__label__3 offline support at least make an offline list feature
__label__2 change of days in app is a major problem i wish it would happen smoothly
__label__3 updated was confused that the event list in the actual app wasn't showing events scheduled for the next few days the widget will only show events in the next 12h the event list in the app also only shows events in the next 12h i think this list should list events for that entire day this means i still depend on other apps for an agenda view
__label__4 great distillation point for my mind maps app is very simple interface to a reasonable amount of credible task tracking functionality
__label__5 i have been using this app for years i can make different lists add reminders and it's very easy to use love it
__label__5 i love this app it helps me to stay focused on my work or whatever other tasks i've set for myself and helps me track time on those tasks i like the whitelist feature so that i can use apps on my phone that are necessary for work while growing a tree and i love plants so keeping them alive is a real incentive thank you for creating it
__label__5 indeed this is probably to be the best tasks app on google play super flexible and user friendly and yet somehow simple at the same time i love how the developer thought of well everything you could need really there is no desktop version yet to sync between computer and phone i would love to be the first to know when it's ready because when i am home well all of us really thanks to the coronavirus at the moment i prefer to open up my laptop to add tasks because it would be done faster that way thank you stephen nottage
__label__3 it does the job i wanted that is to ring alarm at the set time however i am unable to clear the timeline that is old ones couldn't get much help from their help center
__label__4 dear team i've been using this app since ages and i'm mostly satisfied but with android 10 i lost the pop up notification feature in the app how can i restore it without pop up notifications only 4 stars thanks in advance reaction for the developer's comment even if i click on the notification in the status bar it doesn't open pop up but the event itself and anyhow pop up notification is crucial for me otherwise i simply miss the notifications from the calendar any eta
__label__1 i can still use all my apps when i'm using this app it just gives me a notification to go back to the app before if i opened instagram for example it would redirect me to the forest app but it doesn't do that anymore therefore the app is useless in my opinion
__label__3 i've only had this app for about a week but so far so good no ads as yet very easy to use
__label__1 it was alright in the beginning but search bar disappeared after adding my tasks guess there is bug who can't handle long task list not recommending
__label__5 so useful i struggle with adhd on a daily basis i can never remember to do simple tasks and things like notebooks whiteboards stickynotes alarms they just don't work but this app helps change the game dude it's a clever way to incentivize completing tasks and it's helping me build better habits with the reminders and penalties for not completing it if you miss it super useful i feel more productive and motivated to get my tasks done i'm grateful this app exists
__label__2 worked okay for awhile sync between devices no longer works and i have the paid for premium account uninstalled on both devices sync fails on both
__label__3 good app a lot of useful features as a premium customer i would like to have the ability to export to an excel or spreadsheet program for reporting purposes also the app freezes a lot on windows
__label__3 you have to subscribe for the pro version i'd rather just have one flat fee
__label__3 it is not working
__label__3 decent app very helpful to split things up visually but several issues over the past few months of usage tasks suddenly stop syncing up from a desktop pc to the app deletion of lists seem to work but then the lists re appear and most recently all the tasks that have been completed over a period of time are suddenly back in my list on a basic level this app is useful for anything more than that it's not the solution i was hoping for i am a little ocd but if you are too then look elsewhere
__label__4 works great most of the time however crashes when making my display size small google pixel recurring error
__label__2 after an update started showing really annoying full screen ads been using it for quite some time will uninstall
__label__3 so it's a good app two things 1 sometimes i'll get back on after a really long session and my tree will have died for no reason when i check the button that tells you it's just a random app that i hadn't opened that day its happened several times and it makes me really sad so please fix this 2 i can't get the app to let me access any other apps sometimes i will use it for homework so i don't get side tracked but i can't open a calculator without sacrificing the life of my tree i wish you could select apps that would be okay to stay on please fix these two things and i will give you 5 stars for sure
__label__3 good
__label__3 limited use so far every time i i touch the calendar icon the app changes to calendar but will not revert back to watch face unless i uninstall and reinstall no back button
__label__1 this app sucks if you dont have the pro version i only had for a few min and couldn't do more than add a task i tried to add an event and wanted to sync chromebook to cell but it wouldn't let me
__label__2 all my habits ended on 29 12 2019 it was not linked to 30 12 2019 i dunno why
__label__5 just the app i need
__label__1 can't sign up with email
__label__5 this is an amazing app i've tried so many habit trackers and todo list type productivity apps this is the only one that's kept me engaged and the community is so wonderful
__label__2 just had a big visual update but if anything the app is getting worse and worse now most of the time when i tap a plus sign to increase count of something nothing happens i have to drag down to refresh and then after it thinks for a minute it'll update the count or not it kind of does what it wants at this point i've mostly stopped using it because of this
__label__3 this app is really very good and have a simple interface and easy to create tasks unlike other apps which are really cluttered this is what i exactly needed however the problem is if the phone is locked it doesnt ring at all also the alarm doesnt go off at the right time if i have set an alarm at 10am for a task it some times goes at 10 10 if it is locked it doesnt go at all please please fix this
__label__5 absolutely amazing app for helping you to organise projects at home and at work and actually get stuff done get it you won't regret it
__label__4 update this app is great but i'm currently not using it i'm not using it because the widget colors don't work for me i'd like there to be different colored backgrounds and text colors for past vs current vs future activities i want to see at a glance what i ought to be doing at that moment without opening the app i'm keeping the app installed in the hopes that the widget will be improved thanks dev
__label__3 mostly really good great for sharing tasks between people phones desktops but the widgets on android keep clearing themselves and have to be re added to work again and repeating tasks constantly change the day they alert you on reminding me the day after or before i set them to i keep having to edit them back again really frustrating what's the point in a daily reminder if it keeps changing to try and alert you the day before it existed edit and again anytime there's a clock change
__label__3 so i assume this app is no longer supported by its owner last update was summer 2018 and i saw lots of negative reviews here and on twitter about owner not responding at all wanted to buy premium but first checked reviews ugh it looked like a really perfect app sad
__label__3 just downloaded the app better review later on
__label__3 good idea but i cannot connect it with my smartwatch
__label__2 i really like this app it's one of the best reminder apps there is however the new custom notifications are horrible it sticks out like a sore thumb you have to manually set between white or black background which means that they don't automatically switch with android 10 dark mode they're also not black but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications title and time also don't line up with other notifications plus it says a min ago which is only accurate if i look at my phone immediately and it turns on the screen when the notification comes in even if it's in my pocket this is a great app but the recent update is one of those 'if it ain't broken don't fix it' moments i really hope you consider going back to standard android notifications or at least provide an option between custom or standard i'll gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens
__label__5 what a great app it has completely made my days more productive and organized thank you so much microsoft i can't wait to see it linked to onenote
__label__3 i paid for the premium app and still get mashed to do a review
__label__3 great app but why can't it show dates as mm dd yy or dd mm yy it would be a great asset to have if you add this on an upcoming update will download again and keep currently uninstalled
__label__4 it's been good using this app to track habit formation
__label__3 this is ok but it required bunch of upgrade and some new features will keep it but wait till is it perfect
"__label__3 good idea and attractive interface but events have to be in your calendar 
to sync there isn't an option to add an event directly through the app i 
don't wish to put work time etc into my calendar"
__label__3 sufficient for my needs simple to use
__label__4 does everything it says it does i use it on my phone and my tablet for 5 years now wish i there was a desktop edition to sync with it and would be nice if there were saved searches seems like that would be easy to implement and so helpful for the users
__label__2 i really did not like the fact that when i set an exact time for stuff i can not sort to according to that so if i want to plan my day 10 am i have to do a 11 am i have to do b i can not sort it by time
__label__3 the app itself is a great concept and it works wonderfully but the fact that you have to pay actual money to help plant real trees is what made me uninstall it altogether this just adds to the idea that helping the earth isn't accessible to everyone which it needs to be end of discussion overall the app is a great concept if you just want to plant fake trees yo help you focus
__label__5 this app really helps me stay mindful of my daily goals being able to visualize my progress helps me to decide where to put more focus and what to prioritize each day it's highly motivating for me personally to be able to tick off the goals i've met and creates a great sense of satisfaction when i've achieved them i highly recommend this app to anyone who could use a little help staying on top of daily tasks and accomplishing daily or weekly goals
__label__1 markdown causes laggy typing in description and it seems i can't disable it
__label__1 busted from the start on the first open of the app i got a 3 pane swipe intro and the first 2 were blank purple screens then on the avatar creation screen the avatar wasn't visible when finally getting in to the app the help text bubble didn't point at anything just the bottom of the screen for the whole dialogue this app sounded interesting but it seems there's a complete lack of interest in quality
__label__4 the app is good but we can overide this by changing the system time manually to future ideally after turning on the time the app shouldn't hv allowed to change the screen even to home screen or settings screen then this could have been perfect but android system may not allow to do so
__label__2 i downloaded this app today but there is a problem that makes me unable to see to do lists habits etc i really want to use this app but i can't do it when i can't see the options it would be great if you fixed it so i can use it
__label__5 very useful
__label__5 obsessed
__label__3 hi i liked the concept very much unfortunately the design really bothered me the different trees are not in the same drawing style and they don't fit together just hated seeing them next to each other
__label__4 i would like to see tags they are already in the app but need a better implementation filters and location based notifications please
__label__3 why doesn't it turns off my message notification
__label__3 you have to select for a reminder that should be standard
__label__5 i've been a paper planner girl for years i need the pretty colors and stickers while i still have a paper planner that hasn't been touched for months i needed something on my phone because with 3 kids spaced 6 years apart we are busy we homeschool year round as well as appointments and family stuff artful agenda fits everything i need update on the fly and it's pretty i keep a tab open on my desktop as well as the app on my phone
__label__4 this is a very helpful and fun way to get yourself in the habit of doing things the daily tasks are a fantastic way to get your daily stuff handled and check them off within the app you've got the ability to create to do lists with due dates and notification reminders can make it ridiculously simple to get even the most complex task completed on top of all this seeing your character earn experience new items and getting pets and mounts turns all the monotony into a wickedly awesome rpg
__label__4 worked well for my purposes
__label__2 updated i want to love this but like others have said it doesn't work with all calendars as claimed to get outlook or any other calendar to work you have to have your calendar sync with google which not everyone wants or can do it also only works with google's smart watch not android wear os smart watches great look and idea but very limited by being google only
__label__5 best
__label__1 great app i love this
__label__3 i was hoping for similar to notes app on iphone not even close but i prob don't know how to use it
__label__3 it was great for 1 day i cant open it a waste of time i need to uninstall and download it again for it to work for just 1 freaking day dont download
__label__2 been using for years just about to delete due to the full screen lengthy ads that not only appear when i add an event they pop up when i'm using other apps did a scan using an ad detector app and business calender is the culprit shame as pervious ad style was ok this is ridiculous though
__label__1 good
__label__4 works great at keeping me organized i have not had it long so i will have to explore the features update new phone i can now use the microphone to add tasks this app is just smart enough i use it as my own personal to do list separate from google tasks which i use for work it's simple with just enough features and not all the predictive noise threaded through all google apps
__label__1 tried making a simple to do list was gone when i went back later
__label__3 after unlocking the tree with sufficient coins the tree is not changing and irt remains fixed in green colour
__label__3 it is useful but not the perfect
__label__1 i never give reviews i believe in if you don't have anything nice to say don't say it my issue is not with the app itself its the fact that i have been charge every single month for over a year i have reached out to the developer many times and nothing there is no subscription for me to cancel i am really over it with this
__label__1 very disappointing complete waste of money now i add notes to a daily repeating calendar event free and easy
__label__3 not available offline tsk
__label__3 think its great but keeps going black and crashing all the time
__label__3 so far it's a nice simple app that makes it easy to organise tasks i am a fan if the widget to let me see different lists but when i switch lists it often unchecks what has already been done which kind of defeats the purpose if this could be fixed i would increase the rating
__label__5 obsessed
__label__2 i like the app it works it's functional and it's great however one thing still strikes me down why the hell are reminders a paid feature seriously what's a to do app without reminders i could use even my calendar or almost any other app and that would too have reminders for free so why should i pay for such a basic feature on a fully fledged app
__label__3 its db un to use
__label__2 ah yes wanna use an advanced calendar well turns out you must have an account for that what's that your eyes are burning under this bright theme well we have a solution just for you as you have seen in our tips you can change the theme oh w o p s no you can't how silly of us to not tell you in tips that buy our premium maybe it's just not what i was looking for
__label__3 hello i recently shifted to a new phone i have a premium membership but i am unable to transfer my data to the new phone please help
__label__2 after last update the widget became very small and clicking on it does not open up the full app also won't sync to my calendar anymore uninstalling
__label__5 this is an awesome app i initially thought the idea of gamifying my life was a little silly but fun after trying for two weeks it is far more motivating than i ever thought thank you this is finally getting me into habits i have been trying to develop i one thing i have difficulty with is the subtasks once i complete the subtasks they don't carry over to the next day's parent task however the rest of the features of this app are so great you still get 5 stars
__label__2 cumbersome and confusing
__label__3 hey i've been using it pretty good but today when i played the forest rain and locked my phone the white noice didn't work like it has some problem
__label__1 no reminder for free version
__label__3 geht nicht mehr
__label__3 the prices for this app is abit stupid when i can find apps that do the same thing for free 26 should give me life not everyone is rich
__label__3 long time user do not like the latest changes changing the location of the remind feature is very frustrating now i keep clicking on the wrong option because it is in the same place as the remind feature used to be please change back
__label__3 it's very useful so far however i'm not sure if you can change your daily routine i made one for monday and it auto filled for every single day of the week whereas i need them different and when i go to try and add a new task to my day that i want it changes it for all of them disappointing and useless if theres no way to bypass that might as well go back to pen and paper
__label__2 i just bought the pro version great app but some menus fail to load achievements store and so on just load continously fixing this would be great i reinstalled the app but it did nothing also random menus sometimes fail to open completely
__label__3 friend was permabanned for calling another friend a mad c t in party chat but here in australia that's a compliment tl dr over sensitive language filter should allow party chat to be unfiltered
__label__3 decent enough gtd app but i only started using it after reading it will be integrated with google assistant soon seems like they've been touting this integration for months with no real action or even updates on when we can expect this disappointing
__label__3 respected team it is not working in oppo f5 actually it is not reminding me despite off given all the permissions find out the solutions
__label__3 not enough customatization
__label__3 have been having issues since last update when adding a to do it defaults to go to the inbox folder instead of going right to 'today' list so have been forgetting to do stuff because i didn't see it lol 5 stars otherwise once the issue is fixed edit sane thing happens when i am on today tab and have it set as homepage
__label__4 i really love this app it helped me quit smoking but i have a few comments i would like to make 1 the badges you receive on certain days are not saved i think it will be more motivating when you know that you are reaching milestones 2 the discussions i posted are also not saved i would like to see my journey posts to keep me motivated as well and to also see how other people interact with them i still love this app a lot and really recommend it
__label__3 can improve if u can add to do list
__label__4 i didn't understand how to add subtask in template i pressed save as template but it saved only the name of template i couldn't find any information about template in help centre please explain me how to add subtask in template
__label__4 i paid for business calendar pro but had problems with the app not working right a year and a half ago downloaded and tried this one and never went back it works no issues for me
__label__2 love it and it's good start to build on but there appears to be syncing issues between calendars no matter how many times i refresh i'm going to give it time before i give up on it i'm big on my happy planner and would totally ditch it for this if it had similar features such as a budget planner one could add i wouldn't use most of the stickers which is unfortunate because i love my stickers in my planners overall good start
__label__4 excellent look and feel i will change my score to 5 if you add a homescreen widget to observe our forest thank you
__label__2 i had the app for the past two years i opened it after around a fortnight and it did not open it just kept crashing i tried re installing the app but it still kept creashing but it was an awesome app when it used to work
__label__5 i've used this app multiple times over the years it helps me stay away from my phone so that i can get tasks done my love for a virtual tree far out weighs my urges to check social media and my blog my grades in college and the cleanliness of my home thanks this app
__label__2 used to be good but recently it shows full screen ads which cannot be turned off
__label__4 turn life into a game create your own tasks and assign value to them pretty cool eh
__label__4 fun for university students the only problem is they don't order the tasks by date do you have to be careful not to miss homework now that i think about it it's actually a big problem for students using the app it is fun overall and i do homework to keep my avatars alive think tamagotchi
"__label__3 the widget is not getting updated until i go into the application the app 
is good but this is irritating please fix this i have already bought pro 
and widget pallete"
__label__3 sync with google tasks totally broken tasks are months out of date
__label__2 can't choose when to start i like setting goals habits for advance dates once i'm done with one also you can't edit a habit goal to start over you have to delete and start new doesn't save your previous habits goals to do again
__label__3 but can't really test this out since i'm tied with habitica oh yeah i personally don't like the avatars though it'd be nice if to upload your own avatar oh just saw other people suggest the same lol
__label__5 you can list what you need to do and set up weekly monthly and daily tasks
__label__2 wasn't sure to begin with as it's not all that user friendly but how frustrating to take a chance anyway pay for premium only to have it not sync with my calendars wasn't really any other reason to pay for premium except that what a small waste of money it's of no use to me now
__label__4 i love the to do lists with simple and useful style and features but the calendar is lacking a bit you should be able to change events color would be nice to have independent notes instead of notes in each task if it had that the app would be the best organizer
__label__3 it was good now alatm sound of tasks is full but sound is low only this app i have seperate alarm volume and its full
__label__4 i have been using habitica for quite some time now and i must say it has been the most useful in helping me establish a structure to my day however the to dos are very limited in its functions it's hard to implement a full task management such as gtd methodology it pretty much only supports next action steps not any layers such as projects or waiting for also syncing across devices can sometimes be problematic i hope they will improve the to dos and make syncing smoother
__label__3 everything about this app is perfect except for the widget support the widget doesn't update with the new tasks i make in the app and i wish i could mark tasks as complete right from the widget i would also like to be able to make multiple notifications for one task or set one task to repeat multiple times a day i also wish the notification for the mission would show up every time great start
__label__3 how come you can't rearrange things in all the list
__label__3 please add location based reminders and missed call reminders
__label__1 doesn't work nothing happens when signing in with google and when creating a new account it just shows server timeout
__label__5 this has been really helpful keeping me on track having to mark your goals off each day has kept me more motivated than usual
__label__4 it's pretty good i wish you could change the type of selector though yes no vs x times a day after habit creation it seems there is no way to do this yet
__label__1 i loaded the app on to my amazon fire it will only display horizontally and i dont have the export option even though i have the premium subscription i can't export my task list either
__label__5 i love it helps me stay organised
__label__1 there should be add different time schedule in app not be in mobile colander
__label__5 very pleasant to work with although it would be nice to have sub skills that are part of a more general skill for example a specific language that is part of languages in general and the option to rank up high level skils for example begginer insert topic here at level 100 evolves to adept insert topic here and goes down to level 1
__label__4 osm osm osm osm
__label__5 app is great in terms of tracking or developing a habit and has great customizations for each i loved the option of reminder but very dissapointed that it never works i never get any notifications or reminders
__label__5 yeah it is really good also i don't know how to make a daily reminder plus the tasks in my widget disappears and i don't know how to put it back
__label__4 i loved wunderlist for the most part i also like to do and think they've done a good job transferring things over one feature i do not like is that the today list has to be made the day of i like to make my today list the night before makes it easier to plan and be prepared when i do that now i wake up in the am and my list isn't visible
__label__3 the app is good but reminders don't seem to be working
__label__5 great
__label__3 i really like it but there's one or two thing's that need to be addit i personally use it to make a list of book that planning to buy and read this year i know there's other apps for this but love the check list style but i don't like how it get deleted after 30 day at most it will be great if there is option for never delete plus adding a imagine option will be nice like wallpaper behind the task name
__label__3 would be 5 stars because it's really great the best calendar i've ever used but it keeps losing things i enter where i have poor reception it's like it thinks it has uploaded them and then forgets them somehow
__label__4 would love love love an offline mode as i don't have internet access at all time but adore this app to keep me on top of my life and mental and physical health
__label__2 great app in the beginning but once you start skipping days the notifications become insulting shaming words for example calling me a couch potato which i am not so dumb what expert would ever say that insults are motivational almost none i'd rather use an app based on the principle of kindness not shaming
__label__1 just starting and learning how to use unable to set correct due date on tasks when i select that task has a due date todays date appears when i click that date the calendar displays allgood so far but when i select a date on the calendar and close it the due date is still today
__label__3 the app is great but things aren't automatic like there's no notification to make me use the app even though i turned it on in settings and the quote of the day is constant until i change to next even if days pass by it should be set to auto change other than these two fixes i love the app
__label__5 really awesome app it helps my team and i go through all our important chores on the date and time we need it the notifications about changes and new chores also really helps because you know exactly when something changes
__label__5 great for managing to do list
__label__4 do you have any plan to make desktop view i am using pro and pretty happy except that part getting more info for schedules and it would be amazing if it provides desktop view a bit inconvenient as a one who is relying on this app a lot
__label__4 no ads that's nice
__label__5 es la mejor aplicacion para planear tareas complejas que hay
__label__2 was ok until i saw the mtx i guess it truely does gamify things now
__label__1 my phone is a samsung s8 the introduction screen is mostly blank and the character customization seems to be broken because your character and customization options don't show up i didnt go any further
__label__5 its a best app for doing every thing
__label__3 nice app
__label__5 finally something that lets me feel like i'm using a paper planner but i don't accidentally leave it at home
__label__4 i looked at a lot of habit tracking apps and this one was the closest i've found to what i was looking for unless i missed how where to do them there are three things i wish i could do in the app first create custom categories subcategories especially under health second edit start dates without having to delete and retype to correct three have the ability to add notes
__label__3 confusion regarding 'sharing' your schedule with other team members or subscibers seriously would it kill them to put an 'added' 'enter' or some kind of 'task completed' button it would save a lot of confusion sending an invite to fellow workers results in a vague link that seems disconnected with the original intention no 'connect with users' or anything other than a link for something that's supposed to be time management related i've wasted hours trying to figure this out
__label__4 great app how can i change the alarm sound
__label__2 worked well but i uninstalled it the water tracker randomly puts four digit numbers during the day i found another app that met my needs
__label__4 could be better if the tasks overdue would automatically show in today
__label__5 works nice good to get visuals and numbers on your habits one of my habits i've only been doing 50 of the time according to the app although i thought i had been doing it a lot more solid app
__label__1 can't import data from wunderlist that's the whole reason you made everyone download this app if you can't fix this most basic function why should i use your app
__label__1 failed at the first hurdle couldnt customise my character to even get started next button worked thats about it galaxy s8
__label__5 exactly what i was looking for needs improvement in terms of features
__label__3 the concept has had an extremely positive effect on my life however i am experiencing bugs with the widgets where exercises are disappearing restarting hasn't helped
__label__5 it doesn't crash often great interface and easy to create an event and or task list don't change a thing
__label__3 good app but notes become a paid feature so uninstalled after a few days
__label__5 big like
__label__3 i'll like it more if i can the way i view this apps difficult for me to type in landscape position
__label__5 i've tried several of these kind of things and this seems the most versatile it takes a while to get the hang of it and i'm still discovering aspects of the app that i didn't know where there most times i think something about the app is not good i am realising that i just didn't uncover the setting that fixes the issue yet
__label__3 still a good program but have knocked a star off because making features free why have i paid for it as i'm getting nothing extra now
__label__2 upon using the app so far i wish that it would be accessible offline other than that the idea to challenge yourself to earn points for your habits and chores is quite remarkable
__label__3 well this is awkward but i cant even find widget option for this app in phone downloaded just an hour ago so this has to be the latest version i believe the whole purpose was to have a clock on my homescreen that has my calender synced it doesnt seem to that may be i'm missing something here i'll definite give an update of this review if i can figured it out
__label__4 dear team i've been using this app since ages and i'm mostly satisfied but with android 10 i lost the pop up notification feature in the app how can i restore it without pop up notifications only 4 stars thanks in advance reaction for the developer's comment even if i click on the notification in the status bar it doesn't open pop up but the event itself and anyhow pop up notification is crucial for me otherwise i simply miss the notifications from the calendar any eta
__label__4 by far and away the best of all the dozens of task manager apps i've tried using so intuitive can't wait for the upcoming feature that's on the way but gotta thumbs down the new widget no way to open the app straight from the widget so i removed the widget from my home screen all together
__label__5 fun cover stickers and layouts
__label__4 great app
__label__5 well pleased with this app
__label__3 i liked how i could customize everything but my linked google fit didnt update my steps i had to input myself and my notifications would only go off if i opened the app myself kind of defeats the purpose of linking and setting up notifications
__label__3 need the ability to create recurring tasks and then edit separate instances not the whole series or event and future instances i need to edit just a specific instance i think it used to work and give me the option to just edit this event but now that is gone
__label__1 i've had this app for years even upgraded it to the premium version loved it then as the developers started updating i started having many issues each time i used the app it would show in the premium or free version it was inconsistent i wrote the customer service for assistance and i didn't get any help so i lived with it most recently i started receiving ads after every entry not okay i sent another email 2 wks ago which they have not responded to which is why i'm here help
__label__4 tagging could be a much better experience doesn't support display by tags in mac and desktop apps there's got to be a way to snooze in bulk should have an option to disable getting alerts for calendar entry already too many of them
__label__3 cant view a month in one screen one week is the maximum that it will show uninstalled
__label__2 there are better alternatives
__label__3 is this offline or can you use this even though your not connected to the internet
__label__2 it's good really helpful but i dunno why suddenly stopped working that buttons are not working my all coins gone bcz i have to uninstall and reinstall again and again 2 days it works well then i dunno why doesn't work properly please correct this problem i'm really dissapointed
__label__5 love it cant wait for it to do even more
__label__3 the app is what you expect
__label__4 perhaps add option to set task list as homepage rest is good so far
__label__3 ever since the new update that came out today i have not been able to use forest every time i try opening the app is says forest has stopped is there any way to fix this
__label__3 the alarms don't work but a good idea
__label__3 app has kept organization relatively simple the past several weeks i have no prob giving this 5 except having issue on my tablet viewing monthly calendar off center i find myself going back forth btwn tablet phone if this is a settings issue that can be resolved pls advise overall i think the app could help many out there
__label__3 never used instant delete
__label__4 great user interface easy to use syncing with google calendar is a huge advantage from to do lists to events you can schedule anything
__label__2 very nice and interesting concept but completely useless because you flipping need wifi to update your checklist furthermore even if my parents didn't control my wifi and i had full access there should be a way to see all your tasks etc at a glance without having to scroll so much also what's the point if you can just go in the settings and set the amount of money you want and a bunch of my friends joined habitica only to leave because it takes up too much time and it's not fun enough
__label__3 two requests please 1 allow the user to set what time the day recurrent tasks reset not everyone's day ends at midnight 2 propagate the theme selected to the widget if i have selected a dark blue theme my widget should have the same dark blue icon s not a bright red habitnow one good so far more customization would make it great thanks
__label__3 good idea but this isn't for me i am much more for classic habit apps
__label__3 bought premium version of the app but the whitelist fuction not working well as the tree isn't be killed when i use app i'm not supposed to
__label__3 i love how the app is almost exactly like the last one the only irritating thing is that the show completed button is no longer at the bottom of the list this button was used so much due to my fingers accidentally completing a task i would just hit the 'show completed' button and my most recent item would be at the top ready to re add to my list now we need to go through a few buttons to find it and it doesn't bring up the most recently deleted item very irritating
__label__5 the dream task reminder app i have been looking for and looking for a long time ui facilities features are just amazing hopefully they don't ruin it by adding and updating it with pointless unasked for features like so many other apps i'll enjoy it while it's good also please don't over saturate it with features like essential pim was good at one point but now it's full of bugs and absolutely dire
__label__1 lmao this app is so bad setting events is a pain time zones don't work the from time and to time of an event don't work if you trust this app for your planning i'm sure you'd go mad because of missing important meetings due to wrong time setting just use microsoft outlook etc and pay for it this one is a waste of time
__label__5 muito interessante
__label__5 so far this app has had a profound impact on me getting things done it does rely a bit on the honor system but if you're down for it it can be very good
__label__2 muito limitador pra quem não paga pra usa e nem é tão vom assim
__label__1 absolutely worthless this app runs a prohibitively clunky interface that effectively voids the promise of ease of life automation google calendar will provide all other services promised by any do for free with no annual subscription rate don't sign up for the free trial it's not worth getting pinged for forty bucks when you decide you don't like it and forget to cancel it in time save your money
__label__3 cool idea woupd be good if it could access my outlook calendar
__label__3 its good the only thing that is missing is the time inclusion like at what time a particular task is planned if that can be added it would be perfect it would be like a personal calendar and activity planner together i hope that can be added
__label__3 it does not play ring tone on my mobile
__label__2 interesting just not for me
__label__3 i downloaded this app on my tablet long time ago full version and recently also downloaded it on my phone as i don't bring my tablet with me all the time i only use the task function because my calendar events do not sync properly i haven't fpnd the sync button on my phone and another not so funny thing for me i am using the same account for both devices but i can't use the full version on my phone i get a message that i need to buy it that's why i need to use my tablet with the full version on it if i want to add something
__label__1 impossible to register circle circle circle and nothing
__label__4 good app could be better
__label__1 it's completely broken things don't show up error codes from the very beginning it's just broken
__label__3 my experience of being on wunderlist was far superior at least you should have replicated the look and feel why kill wunderlist
__label__5 www httpe com emile
__label__2 i transitioned from wonderlist there are a couple of things i don't like when the list is sorted any way then you can not drag the items in the list this makes it very hard to organize long lists also i would like to have the option of adding to the top of the list as well as the bottom otherwise the app is good for what i need it to do
__label__5 this this is what i was looking for well worth upgrading to premium
__label__2 i just installed this app on my droid today when setting up my account i signed in using my gmail account however i am unable to do that on my laptop i get an error message when i input the gmail address and password i was looking for a replacement for google's inbox i would like something that is accessible on both my phone and my laptop i guess i need to keep looking
__label__4 habitnow is the first todo list with a key feature i've been looking for to do items that are automatically created at certain times as such it is the best such app i've ever used the only problem is that the author made no provision for hiding completed items they just hang around cluttering the list the best it does is move them to the bottom i find it very odd that anyone would want to stare at completed to do items certainly that shouldn't be the default but there it is
__label__5 love it cant wait for it to do even more
__label__4 hi can i have an option to choose between the new and old designs of the widget the previous version was able to have larger boxes to fit long description tasks while the new one just puts three dots and shortens the task descriptions to fit in one fixed width which disables full reading of the task bad also subtasks cannot be seen without clicking the main task which kinda defeats the purpose again of having a todoist widget where i should be seeing the overview of everything thanks
__label__2 good app but don't bother with premium i bought premium for the powerful widgets and ability to track extra habits don't bother the widgets are nothing special and if you read the tips section the developer even says it's best to only track a few habits at a time after feeling ripped off i emailed the developer twice requesting a refund but have received no reply great free app but don't waste your money on premium
__label__3 the reminders are helpful and the app is easy to use especially when tracking more than one habit my only quibble is that when i changed phones it didn't port my records over like the instructions said they would but i did at least download the records ahead of time edit i returned to this app after a hiatus and not only had it deleted my data it also essentially deleted me i can't log in and when i try to register it says my email address is already taken
__label__5 after using many other like app finally i decided to return back and use this very composed app is developed
"__label__5 hi i love this app and have been using it for a while now it is the only 
one that have calendar and to do fit togheter the only thing that i would 
add for my needs is the possibility to share with others our activities 
even in the paid version seems to not have this feature are you guys 
planning to add it on"
__label__1 i wasted my time and money because it doesn't sync to my watch i spent hours trying to get it to work i emailed the developer a few times but it took a few emails before he realized that his program doesn't sync to the gears s3
__label__2 good concept but simply doesn't work i can still use every single app without any intrusion the tree doesn't even die when i close the app and restart it totally broken
__label__4 i'm surprised this app actually works for me it helped me procrastinate less but i also realised it works only if i remind myself to check the app a lot i recommend it for those who have really bad procrastination problems like myself even if the game style of this app isn't your thing it's a great to do list app for habits daily reminders and general to do items only complaint is it's glitchy for me when i want to customise my avatar
__label__3 i think it could be more user friendly but maybe i haven't explored it enough it keeps asking for a rating maybe it will stop now
__label__3 i love habitica and i like the ui of the updated app but i find it frustrating that the app doesn't show all the content that the website does normally this is just a small annoyance but now after paying for a group plan for my family i'm discovering that my kids can't access the group tasks list via the app which makes the entire thing a waste of money since the whole point was to be able to create tasks for family chores please tell me a fix is in the works
__label__4 great app but voice quality sometimes poor
__label__3 great app only problem is that whenever i set reminders for the task i set i don't really receive them would definitely rate 5 stars if this problem is fixed
__label__5 this is a great app it's peaceful to look at easy to use i really wanted a flylady app housecleaning reminders and was able to add those routines tonight i will uncheck the daily chores every night work away at the weekly zones and get my house back in shape meanwhile i keep track of grocery lists who needs new shoes big city reminders for our next trip thanks for making such a simple versatile customizable tool
__label__3 bad calendar sync
__label__1 puts all info in default google calendar
__label__1 don't buy the premium version of this app synching doesn't work stick with the free version which would be 4 stars
__label__3 i like your app but the free version is very restricted please at least add achievements and custom tags to free version by the way great app
__label__1 would have been nice to know the price before using up my data for download just to be uninstalled seconds later
__label__2 please make it available as a widget
__label__5 it was the best just one thing is not good that is not hard i need to reorder by finger rapid and soft like wunderlist and others i don't wanna to go in task and change priority it's so hard to imagine that work was what you are great thank you
__label__1 super buggy on android have to close and open constantly for anything to work
__label__4 nice
__label__5 i like it because i can keep track of things i need to do i like the highlighted color it's a good sky blue and it's easy to make lists it feels good to complete a list that takes a long time to complete it's good for making for later and good for getting things done i give it 5 stars
__label__2 not good
__label__2 the actual free version doesn't allow you anything not even to learn how to use the app properly that role is filled by 7 days of free premium the free on the description is a lie is a paid only app with temporary free access to its full features that gets practically useless after the 7 day trial if you can get past that sort of business practice to actually try it i think the app may be great but i don't like to be lied to edit i opted for tictic after some experiments
__label__3 not happy with the switch from wunderlist why did you remove the option to assign a list to a group at the time you are creating a new list it is cumbersome and time consuming to have to drag the list to a new group especially when you have numerous groups and lists as i do and i move them often what a pain
__label__3 good but expensive
__label__5 well thanks for the app and the nice touches and effort that've been put in it however there are other simple things you can adjust adding colors options for every habit making marking with color scheme and check marks at the same time making an access on laptop when i put measurable habit he ask me about the account twice idw what is for i know you want to keep the app with beautiful simplicity which is great but you should offer more options for those who wants more
__label__3 it's fine to use to check off stuff and gain lose habits and get rewarded for it but the formatting is so ugly and it's so easy to cheat which kinda defeats the purpose of the app like you can make yourself level 100 or give yourself 2 000 gold if you want to plus there's a lot of bugs even though habitica has been alive since either 2015 or 2014 so that kinda says it all for how much the staff is on things
__label__5 good simple screen best i've seen for a while also brings together calendar tasks and notes
__label__5 review as of 1 4 2020 this is a very great app it is very useful and helpful and the bug with some places not loading is fixed
__label__2 i had made an account for this app a long time ago but didn't use it for long and i forgot why until i re downloaded it today this is one of those apps that's incredibly frustrating because a lot of the main advertised features are behind a pay wall and or you have to make an additional account for paying more than 1 mo for a list app is ridiculous if anything it should be a one time purchase
__label__1 will not be using ever again
__label__4 simple to use clean interface
__label__4 it gives a nice visual look at the day
__label__5 very easy to use helps me to not miss things that aging was making me forget
__label__4 awesome app i love it simple and great reminder systems one big thing is missing though family calender shared calender with family members incisive kids without the app phone e mail and option to organise event and tasks for other familymembers
__label__5 i love this app i just wish it wasn't so easy to change your stats and i wish we could delete the default daily tasks maybe i can but i'm a dumbass idk
__label__1 be very careful this syncs with your tasks in outlook at first that sounds great until you find out that if you use any feature of outlook that isn't in this app regenerating tasks after completion for example your tasks are overwritten in outlook with ones compatible with this app resulting in loss of things like due dates i lost all my regenerating tasks replaced by occurring tasks instead causing so many items to be late if you use any kind of advanced outlook tasks don't use
__label__4 it a great app repeating tasks are great when its chores that you only do once in a while and sub tasks can actually be helpful too the reason i give it 4 stars is because priorites in tasks come in a very tacked on way
__label__3 really enjoying this app but wish i could track more than 5 habits
__label__5 good ui and helpful options have recently purchased the pro version for extra functionality
__label__1 online sync is no longer working and last update was june 2018 which is more than a year is there a reason why i should continue using this app
__label__1 ex happy wunderlist user disgruntled with this half baked attempt most of the fine details that made wunderlist great were omitted with an option to include them at some vague point in the future interface does look cleaner but there are fewer details that help tasks being organized visually for a standalone app it would deserve a 3 star for an app that is supposed to replace wunderlist it would get a 2 star for an app that tries to get users by killing it's better competitor even a 1 star is too much
__label__2 premium version only
__label__2 i used to love this app but they made the ads much more intrusive taking over the full screen with countdown timers any time you do anything i guess i'll go back the regular google calendar app reply to developer that'd be great if you remove the terrible ads for now i'm uninstalling and checking out other calendar apps
__label__1 why you changed layout to old one its really bad and annoying
__label__4 i like it a lot until you have overlapping times for your schedule or events it's too hard to tell which one you are looking at cuz it only shows one unless you touch it or open it but that defeats the purpose of it it's for a quick glance fix that n ur golden
__label__1 not able to set reminder of am by default it is 'pm' and not able to select 'am'
__label__4 great app help i unfortunately forgot my password i was very sure it's correct but i'm not sure why it says it's wrong is there anything that can be done about it
__label__1 frustrating i brought the upgrade and none of the features show up none no to do tab no widgets nothing so someone get back to me and explain why the app isn't showing any of the features in your description
__label__4 this app does exactly what you need it to not perfect but great at its job
__label__3 can't put a recurring every x weeks on a certain day not to monday no matter what i set and save no matter if i try to modify one it is always only monday if i choose two days the second can be any other day please fix this also i can't seem to be able to modify a recurring every 2nd day of month tipe of event chain
__label__3 first two slides doesn't load the character in character creation menu items are invisible pls fix
__label__2 typical of microsoft they bought a really great app wunderlist killed it and replaced it with an app that is nowhere near as easy to use
__label__3 overall good a search feature would be great for notes thanks
__label__4 good
__label__5 amazing
__label__3 nice i really like this app this is very nice app to remind me our daily routine and save our time
__label__5 great app easy to use no bumps or lumps so far no annoying 24 7 interruptions like a lot of apps produce
__label__2 the notification bar does not work the add task option appears i enter the task and click on the icon there's just a progress spinner the close icon does not dismiss the notification bar either how inconvenient had this issue in oreo too right now i am on nougat also the animations inside the app are slow the icon where you tap to 'tick' the task is very small
__label__4 really nice app that is easy to use would be cool to see a feature where you can build things like building a village and materials for this are acquired through completing tasks habits
__label__3 very very good better than todoist imo docking two stars because is getting buggier couple weeks ago wouldn't sync and now notifications are vibrating when phone is in vibrate mode considering a switch to microsoft to do
__label__2 good not bad
"__label__3 it's ok there's no actual options to make a list i have to number each 
item task action etc myself in paragraph form there's no proper list 
formatting in there besides that it's alright not what i had hoped"
__label__1 pangit
__label__2 heavily intrusive pop ups each time phone is unlocked monetized poorly designed difficult to make custom named to do lists
__label__3 cant get demo to play its probably a great app
__label__5 honestly pretty simple to use and i like the simplicity in the design as well as i haven't seen an ad as of yet and it doesn't push for money it's just here to help and for that it deserves much more then a thanks
__label__3 my notifications bar is telling me i have no tasks today even when i know i do which is kind of frustrating plus when i log into the app my tasks aren't in chronological order for some reason after i set times for them at the beginning of the day other than that i think it's a fab app and i love the little pop ups that happen at the beginning of the day and when a task needs to be done
__label__3 probably a good app and way to track your new habits but not being able to make a widget without a premium account is ridiculous
__label__5 since microsoft scrapped wunderlist for microsoft to do which is a significant downgrade i had to look for an alternative i can't believe that i found something that not only gave me back everything i lost from switching to to do but is actually a major improvement highly recommended
__label__4 the app has helped me track my habits and create new better habbits i have been 7 weeks drinking nothing but water and have been on and off with candy and snacks just like any other habit tracking app this will not do the work for you it is here to hell you keep track of the work you are putting forth and it does a good job at that
__label__4 the app is really good but there shouldn't be a premium version of this app it should be free
__label__3 it ok gets boring after a while
__label__4 looks cool and i like the stats i would like to have a monthly and yearly calendar display on which dates with non repeating tasks scheduled are bold or otherwise highlighted or preferably have the tasks listed in small font in the box for that day in monthly view and when you click on the date have all tasks for that day display why do none of the life rpg apps i've tried not have calendars it's bothersome to add something to a calendar and then open up another app and add it in again
__label__5 very nice app i frequently used it since 2014 until now
__label__4 it's better then the other apps i've tried but there should a bottom where it says you couldn't do the task instead of just turning the task as an overdue
__label__4 straightforward solution for business and personal use in my cell and laptop sometimes i get a bit lost on how to get from granular details back to an overview of projects
__label__5 i searched for quite some time to find a calendar app that my wife and i could share business calendar is an excellent solution we have it installed on our phones and tablets and all are in sync no more asking what she is doing today thanks bc team
__label__3 app did not properly import all data from wunderlist as microsoft claimed it would all of my 'created dates' for items in my list got wiped amd set to the current month day and year of when i did the import a couple days ago this would seem to be a simple table record to grab from the wunderlist database to transfer over to to do i would expect a cleaner and better qa'd experience from a company like microsoft this is as of build 151
__label__2 when u want to add check list this will help you out instead of writing some where u can add them out here but in the case u want to develop it as a habit then u have to changes the setting and activate habits mode even in that u can create only 5 habits if u want to create more than 5 habits u will be asked to update to premium version only 5 habits thats funny if its atleast 10 then okay
__label__4 i have looked and looked for an app that would let me make lists and check them off like pen and paper and this does that simple and great to use
__label__5 really good
__label__1 3 99 per month to make the app usable pos
__label__1 has no sign in option only export and the file won't open so unless you have an it friend you lose your file which meant all the stuff i put in tasks has gotten lost if the developer revolves this is i will edit this review
__label__3 i can't use the desktop app for windows it won't let me sign in with my google account please fix this furthermore some more themes for both the phone app and desktop app also a feature where the user can attach progressive pictures that correlate to their habit would be nice as well for premium users if i can have 99 attachment a day on premium why not this suggestion
"__label__3 i love this app buuuut there's a lot of small simple things that can be 
added to the actual organization system that can make it much more 
effective on people for now bigger concerns please allow task and 
etc making setting marking and etc to be allowed to be done offline 
it's worth it and will be effective trust me when making tasks and all 
that good stuff there's an option to have a start date this does nothing 
i suggest that this should let the said task or etc to only show up on the 
date you stated or have a tag you can activate to show it or at least not 
turn red or damage you until the start date of your choice or just some 
concept of long term task setting please when i try to make a party in 
the mobile app it directs me to a window in chrome that then tells me to 
use the mobile app really love this best of wishes in developing"
__label__4 a fun way to get into habits makes me want to do things in real life as i find it very rewarding i think it would be helpful if there was a timestamp on the dailies habits as to when you last checked the item off i don't have the best memory and feel like some days i double up on certain tasks because i can't remember if i've checked it off or not alredy i would like to see how long it has been since i last did a task again i often forget other than that it's fantastic
__label__2 events won't show up on the clock after i adjust the time of the event they show up and then i change the time and they disappear so so frustrating i wanted to save time not waste it why why why i used this app for 5 minutes and then hit a roadblock why
__label__3 i like the app and it's a pity that i won't keep on using it because of the absence of monthly overview for dailies which i need most from a habit tracker instead of useless strikes
__label__5 great incentive nudge to be present during the activity practice of your choice a gentle way to reinforce mindful habits if i know my tree is going to die because of lack of time or focus i either clear more time if possible schedule the task for a more appropriate time slot or take a few deep breaths to center to why i chose to do this or is this something i really want to do in the first place it's like a little promise to yourself before diving in
__label__3 try on
__label__2 this app would be 100x better if it incorporated some of the editting customizing functions of the other to do list apps out there i want to be able to strike through each of the to do items and view deleted archived completed items be able to choose colors etc
__label__4 plz 1 widget that shows the current date list of upcoming events 1 click option to open calendar 2 ability to set reminders alerts for scheduled events 3 ability to sync to phone's stock calendar android 4 additional settings ability to customize the color of the circle indicating current date 5 ability to actually see the inspirational quotes in the app even if a new tab was necessary 6 ability to create tasks and designate their priority as high low or routine along with the option
__label__5 i'm a novice free user and i use it primarily to set reminders i love the way it pops up at the bottom of the screen and the display of the reminders the design and user friendliness is super cool it's been a wonderful experience so far and i highly recommend it
__label__5 this app is super helpful 10 10
__label__5 useful widget to view the schedule of calendar what i like the most is i can just activate one event of google calendar and see it in the widget was looking for this type of app for a long time
__label__1 no help to be had no tutorials available after 3 days i could not even find out how to delete notes perhaps i am just stupid perhaps it doesn't work with my phone uninstalled and we'll try something else to work with my google assistant
__label__4 i've been using this app and the watch face on my moto 360 for close to about a year now with all my events for the day and the next day visible on my wrist i can keep track of my calendar easily however recently the watch face is defaulting to 'simple clock' default watch face whenever i use the watch it only affects sectograph and it has been bugging me since
__label__2 updated i did not download the app elsewhere the chinese language came out after i cleared the data of the app because of the crashes it came back to normal after reinstalling it another update the app crashes again after it there is really something wrong with your app here
__label__2 hi developer need to improve note module it fix only for protrait view which is when i'm using landscape view tablet with keyboard i need to adjust my head or the gadget tq
__label__4 really helpful app i've looked at lots of other schedule apps but this one is the easiest for me to customize precisely great for making routines since a few of my routines overlap it would be amazing if there were an option to see routine titles in the widget timeline above or before the task in order to keep an overview of which whose routine is in effect both of my children have their own different weekly routines so it would be nice to see on the timeline that for example it's kid 1 who has school on monday mornings and kid 2 on monday afternoon instead of two time for school tasks with no specifics it would also be great if this app could be accessible from my computer desktop or if i could sync with other family members
__label__4 i have tied a few calenders this one is good for multiple accounts easy to turn them off and on its quite clear on a phone screen
__label__3 great app but needs to be able to switch accounts easily i have an account for personal life and work life on my phone it is very difficult to switch back and forth and keep my other apps happy that are connected to todoist
__label__1 it won't sync tasks with google so what is the purpose and customer support is helpless no one knows how to communicate about the problem and they make the issue worse instead of fixing it wish i could give it 0 stars
__label__3 ok
__label__1 i don't want to name everything
__label__4 enjoy todoist premium but an update to the widget has made the fonts smaller as this is more difficult to see i don't think it's an improvement
__label__2 didnt like that to really use it as a planner i had to upgrade
__label__4 i love this app it's the only one i've found which combines tasks and habits in a simple way however i do get frustrated that i can't seem to change the scheduling of a habit after i've set it up e g if it's set for once a week and i want to make it twice i have to delete it and create a new one can you please fix this
__label__4 great for to do's and keeping on track with schedules notifications need to be adjusted i don't always hear when they go off and sometimes miss my stuff
__label__3 routine module and programming is nice any plans to make it a tracker app log if the schedule event is accomplished completely partially or not accomplished for example drinking water few times a day exercising 1hr per day
__label__3 please integrate kanban from web to the mobile app
__label__3 i've just installed this as and won't be using it due to it requiring you to create an account and login it sounds like a fantastic app but i'd much rather my data was stored locally where only i have access to it
__label__3 my favorite thing is when to do list speak loud the task to do is good not having to read your screen i unistalled because i miss this feature
__label__2 love the concept but always keeps crashing please do something about it
__label__4 new user and i'm impressed a lot of neat features i've been looking for in apps like this it's obvious dev is active and listening and thats a great sign if i have an immediate suggestion it'd be for us to be able to add tab categories of traits besides the default characteristics skills for example to add things like personality lifestyle or however we want to organize our skillset categories so those 2 sections aren't cluttered a search option for icons too maybe keep it up
__label__1 when group planting only host's timer starts asked friends to purchase the app however each time we try to plant together and start the timer only host's countdown begins the other people in the room get stuck on waiting for the host to start message
__label__3 after the update widget stopped reacting but after deleting it and reinstalling it worked again and then came back to same problem
__label__3 good
__label__2 i like that it allows specific habits i don't like that it does not give proper percentages of how much you've done your habits after using it about a month i deleted it because even though i was doing almost every habit 100 it kept giving me 50 it was demoralizing
__label__1 alexa shopping list integration is rubbish items are added correctly but if an item is removed by another user they never leave the list
__label__5 this is one cool app not only is it useful but it also has an aesthetically pleading footprint
__label__3 is there any ways to see your progress in graphic like daily task you've done and see it in graphic stats or something because i can seems to find one in the apps or did i miss something i wsnt to know and compare my tasks daily the ui and everything is good tho except for that graphical stats daily i cant find one here dev
__label__2 premium is very expensive
__label__4 i've been enjoying the app i love how i can easily set recurring tasks there's just one thing i wish i could change i wish i could change the hour at which a new day begins i know that sounds weird but i am a night owl and usually don't go to bed until after midnight before i settle down for the night i like to review my day and check off tasks that i forgot to check off earlier but by the time i do that it is technically a new day and the tasks are automatically marked overdue
__label__4 разработчик исправил ошибку которая не давала начать и оказалось что приложение довольно хорошее но режим испытания бред кто то его использует по фану и исход решает рандом кто то пиарит свой ютуб канал так же нет приоритизации сложности целей т е кто то поставит сложной целью написать диплом а кто то сходить в магазин дорого в игровой валюте стоят квесты за неделю так и не получил хотя целей было много удалил его так как мне не подходит дизайн для офиса но это уже особенность
__label__3 disappointing and unreliable it's sad to see this app struggles to be as great as its predecessor wunderlist if you set a daily reminder and one day forget to mark it as complete the app will not remind you again about it if the due date and reminder date are different you will not be reminded about the task i don't care if i'm receiving a notification about a thing i had to do 3 weeks ago i just wanna be reminded no one is this strict with dates i hope this helps improve the app
__label__4 i'd give it 5 but drropping a star because it shows useless notifications every time i open it
__label__3 i am kind of sad that we are not able to choose where to put the tree on the terraine other than that the app seems great also would be interesting to have the actual forest overview as a widget on your display
__label__1 the app itself gets the job done but it will not sync and the developer is not responsive to questions don't waste your money with premium you won't get what you pay for
__label__5 great app
__label__3 i wish i could use whitelist for free because i live in iran and can't pay for it
__label__2 started off really well but has stopped working properly now great shame as it has a lot of promise
__label__3 no app funciona muito bem mas infelizmente não está sincronizando corretamente com a versão web ainda é o melhor app que já usei na categoria
__label__5 love this this is a fun way to build your self up
__label__3 happily used for years unfortunately my events have been disappearing lately for no reason so i will be uninstalling
__label__5 fantastic app it helped me develop a good study habit of remaining focussed and taking positive breaks in moderation
__label__1 compared to version 1 poor allows for editing one entry of for example a weekly appointment but rather than edit the one instance as you think you are doing it creates a new one so you have a double entry the original which you can't delete even after synching if you've set weekly appointments and one is cancelled you should be able to edit that one instance without creating a duplicate i've had this installed for some time now thinking that the developers would resolve these problems but although the app has regular 'updates' nothing has changed drag and drop defaults to copy imo should be 'move' by default if you change an appointment it changes not duplicates also the interface and look big text and colours looks like a children's calender while the original version actually looked quite professional
__label__3 generally a useful app i've found using a visual reminder to stay focused has helped and working toward unlocking new plants was fun i found the recent increase in cost to unlock plants demotivating and i've been using the app less since it happened
__label__2 some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing the options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date project category etc these have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps there is no sorting options or filters on views ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful too many clicks to edit tasks eg notes comments rescheduling
__label__1 nobody use this app read all the forums the app does not support the sync once you've bought premium everyone's saying the same and the devs do not respond to help requests i have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly i am connected to the internet i am a premium user the app is great but please help me with my problem i'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error
__label__3 forever landscape why can't i ever get this app to rotate to portrait mode it's never been able to do this even after downloading it on other phones way too annoying to have to deal with for me to deem it a useful app at least for me
__label__3 this app is amazing but after one day when i try to open it it will just go back to my phone home screen when i uninstall it then install it again it will work but i will lose my forest and after a day it won't work again please fix this issue i really love this app besides that issue i'm facing
__label__1 ads ads ads
__label__3 just lowered my rating used to work great but now does not properly sync everything in my task list with my google calendar on my computer it will sync new events new tasks but if i edit a task ex change the date of the task it does not sync properly w my google calendar it used to be that all edits synced appeared the same in both the app my google calendar but not now i have been emailing with the support for this app but have not yet found a solution
__label__3 it's a good app but i wish it would allow multiple users to see each others task list and to send task to each other
__label__1 i can't get new password it sends message email is not available
__label__1 the app hasn't synced for nearly 9 months despite being a premium user the support team haven't acknowledged my email it's a good concept but they've failed to make it work and don't provide customer support check other reviews go to play google store on a web browser select my account and go to order history select the and it offers you an option to request a refund that should get the developer to either repair it or take off the premium services it is falsely selling
__label__3 good but need some improvements some times completed task show in to fo list
__label__3 hi there this app really helps me a lot in keeping myself focused and restraining myself for overusing my phone but right after updating the app i was unable to open the app again please fix this problem as soon as possible thanks
__label__3 i like the app and the idea i don't know if it's only me but since the app is working in the background all the time and it's a requirement from the app the battery consumption is quite high is there a way of fixing it the app is already running with locked screen it is automatically locked thanks
__label__3 hi thanks for responding and i'll be more specific please bring back the pretty orange background for the top bar and each of the routines the current color is too pale
__label__2 couldn't get past registration login i've never used the app before but when i tried to make an account it said that my email has been taken and when i went to login it just kept loading forever
__label__5 really helpful for making me stay focused on studying i think the guilt of killing a plant is very motivational however there was a weird bug during finals week i was using this app for hours straight but then it suddenly stopped working when i click the plant button nothing happens i left it alone for awhile and its okay now but i wonder why it happened i also really like the store and think its very motivational
__label__4 still enjoying this app after all these years
__label__4 great app but would be good if you could edit tasks after you've written them also would be good if it could have a daily 'things to do list'on calendar which could be ticked off alongside projects tasks
__label__4 i really love how i can see my task list and calendar side by side the only reason why im not giving it a 5 is because i would really love a desktop version to use when im on my laptop
__label__3 this is all well and good but it doesn't tell me how to use to do to do anything like making separate list or subcategories for each list
__label__5 i have been using artful agenda on a desktop this year and love all it's features now the app makes it even more accessible i love planning meals and mapping out my day
__label__3 it doesn't reset or set you reminders but it helps
__label__1 inaccurate always says activity overlaps with another activity when it doesn't
__label__1 resonse 2 13 20 i know that the free version is not ad free the issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away and this happens while i'm trying to add or edit something on the calendar had to change from 5 to 1 star because of these pop up ads will be looking for a new app soon
__label__2 how do i unsubscribe this useless app
__label__5 awesome experience
__label__3 nice calandar easy to use there's one thing and that is the lack of a good notification on the screen i mist a few appointments because of that so i deleted the calendar i really liked it but i need a good warning system
__label__3 this app is very helpful total game changer for my adhd unfortunately after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped but overall i'm happy this app exists it really helps me stay on track perhaps if the game cost a few dollars to purchase the developers wouldn't need to resort to capping in order to create revenue from the app i feel as though many people will quit once the rpg element is restricted
__label__2 the only thing i can't stand is every time i get a notification i get two notifications for the same event i sure it's a setting but i can't find it
__label__5 i have been using this app for years i get really hooked on committing to longer focus times just to unlock the full potential of the trees offered there are different aspects to the tree with different amounts of study time ie less than 60mins greater than 60mins and a special one for 2 hours of focus plus bushes as someone with adhd and ocd which may explain my obsession with this app studying wouldn't be the same without forest
__label__2 everything i wanted it for i had to do the pro mode
__label__3 i have a problem the i want to bar at the bottom is covering up the someday subsection of tasks please fix this
__label__2 excellent app but google assistant support integration is in coming soon state for about 2 yeas is there a chance to see it available in next 5 or 10 years
__label__2 there should be a dark mode instead of setting through a premium theme option
__label__3 i love this app but i wish free users could do more without a membership like at least they could be able to see the leaderboard
__label__4 a really great idea with a lot of great features i love it a lot however it's a bit unresponsive at times actions that previously worked will occasionally not go through for mystery reasons and the widgets while displaying correctly have bad interactivity thats said the art is cute the features are helpful and extensive and the positive impact it has on my habits is amazing
__label__3 good
__label__3 a very helpful software especially in management work
__label__3 very motivational but what's with the subscription fee fifteen dollars a year
__label__2 pain ya have to create an account to access
__label__5 best app ever it keeps track of your habits and if you turn on reminders it also keeps you accountable of the goals you set simply genius
__label__3 hi the reminder feature is not working supporting in my phone also if possible please add support in your app to contact for bugs thank you
__label__3 it's finally getting better although still doesn't measure up to wunderlist but the latest update broke the widget please fix
__label__3 i like it however i can't seem to get the notification sounds to work they used to
__label__5 easy to use and reminds me via notifications and email keeps my life on track
__label__1 tech support is so vague with their pricing i'm sorry but you just lost an interested customer cancelled trial and any plans of subscribing to premium
__label__3 good
__label__1 i find it a good application but i find the microsoft service very bad accounts are a problem and a mess always crashes without reason so stop using email now with this application i only opened it once and it already tells me that account is locked i will definitely not use any of their products again and they do not even give any technical service the attention to users is terrible i do not recommend microsoft products
__label__2 the new update destroyed the widget terrible
__label__4 simple to use and track tasks
__label__2 you basically can't do anything if you don't buy the full version
__label__1 it's takes a lot of space
__label__1 cannot share entire calendar and or task database with other users only single daily task shares or individual list collaborations edit very solid low 1 star 0 if i could since the developer couldn't even be bothered to read the entire of two sentences of review acknowledging what features they did have
__label__4 if only the calender icons cld stop piling up on the phobe task bar everytime one is due so if i created 5 events to go off in an hr i'll have 5 icons piled up on my fone it's not needed or at least put an option so people cld disable it if they don't want it
__label__1 not allowing me to delete my account
__label__5 everything is ideally pinpointed there is instant access to tabbed features it is a smooth and seamless system for organizing at a glance significant business network dates meetings holidays it is a good tool for accessing daily activity reminders i highly recommend this portal
__label__2 never tried it yet
__label__3 it is a very good app but it has many glitches the widget requires you to open the app to update and in some occasions even when you check some activities as completed they still appear in your list it is a good app but it doesn't run smoothly
__label__5 love this app just wish i could use it on my surface pro as well as my phone
__label__3 everything thing is customizable but there is no timer i want timer for every sub task that i create every single task i do i want a time and daily stats for the same need to download some other providing the same for now when you include this mail me i will download again
__label__3 why did you show the checkboxes in widget when you can't even check uncheck it via the widget its just so frustrating to go to the app just to check a list other than that this app is good
__label__4 yes this is a great app i like all the different variations and things i can tailor to my own needs
__label__1 closes everytime i try to add a note event or anything else since last update
__label__3 app is good have lot of features but i would suggest one basic thing that needs to be changed in tasks app the menu can be reached by pressing the title icon also to change the list we have to press the icon on top left corner of widget it is different and little disturbing from normal process we are following since many years please try to change the menu button on widget to the top left icon thanks
__label__3 very nice
__label__2 while swiping towards right the tasks are getting deleted at least it should ask for confirmation whether the delete is happening accidentally or we really want to delete
__label__5 love everything about this app
__label__1 the app is ok cancellation is very awkward if you make it difficult to cancel a premium account it puts me off your company and your product
__label__5 ticktick is complex enough that it can handle all the things i need to dump out of my brain but simple enough that it gets out of my way and causes very little friction it's a well polished app and offers quite a lot in the free version
__label__3 looks promising would like to see routine sharing sync some routines you have to do with your wife marking activity as done have tags on timers and have more analytics on the actual timeline data not routines i personally would pay a premium for these features
__label__4 good
__label__4 it helps me stay focused wish you could allow certain apps that you need to use
__label__1 i can use habitica on the browser but i can't login via facebook in the app the facebook login shows up i enter my credentials then nothing
__label__1 not sure how this app received such high ratings it is just making you add events in your google calendar to create a pie i don't want to add daily tasks to my google calendar i thought this app was going to be more efficient but it's not
__label__3 everything requires you to pay money might as well make it a paid game instead of deceiving people for a free app
__label__5 very easy to use
__label__1 very bad experience
__label__3 still want to go thoroughly with this app
__label__2 this app is really very good but notifications aren't working i tried everything it told me to do but it's still not working
__label__3 facebook login not working
__label__3 any do is great for list but the calander app lacks they have a new plan your day feature but the times dont show up next to the task on the calander so not sure why you would bother scheduling task i think im going to find an app that allows list and an hpurly daily planner
__label__1 it doesnt do any thing its gliched everytime i open it
__label__4 not bad it's a basic to do list which establishes days when a project is to be completed and a list of tasks that were uncompleted uncomplicated and useful i would like to see the option that shows a job partially completed some projects need to be held over and a more customisable repeat process every fortnight or third friday of the week
__label__4 almost perfect but need time setting for due dates as most students using it will require to have proper time input of their assignments cheers to the team did a great job
__label__2 good idea implementation to be revised the management of the task is not clear the dates are showed in a confusing way again the concept is good but the user interface has to be improved and updated
__label__2 really weird formatting i'm trying to be more organized not get a brain workout trying to figure out an app
__label__3 let me try it first
__label__2 i'd like it except the widget is the most important feature for me it displayed my inbox for about a week and now comes up blank the tasks are there tho i can read them if i open them or open the app you're not the only organizer with this problem tho android 9
__label__4 haven't been using this app for long but it seems great so far i love that incompleted tasks roll over to the current day i just wish you could attach attach photos or files to your notes that would make this a 5 star review
__label__2 new layout and functionality is no bueno don't like the interface for rescheduling tasks please fix
__label__2 i'm so confused and frustrated trying to figure this app out
__label__3 widget isn't opening calendar i've deleted and restarted and when i use the 3x1 i think it opens to the day only and won't go back to the month view like it used to
__label__3 it would be better if i could see a whole day shedule at once maybe with applying two widgets that doesn't show the same period of time or if i could croll time not only in the app but on the widget too
__label__5 really easy to use and great for calendar blocking
__label__4 you should keep recurring tasks for free that is the only reason i left using your app four years ago and started to use google keep everything else is great
__label__2 can we have the lists back at the top of the page like wunderlist i don't need any of the options that take up the top half of my screen
__label__5 i have loved the past 2 days of using the free version and coupled with focus mode on my phone the past 2 days have been super productive thank you
__label__5 this app helps me with my tasks the new update is really awesome i'm impressed and totally satisfied thanks
__label__5 helps you organise in a jiffy
__label__1 infoo
__label__2 it keeps bugging out whenever i try to do anything it wont stop doing ghe tutorial and wont ket me delete tast and stuff
__label__5 so convenient easy to use a real game changer for me in managing my home business home life simultaneously
__label__1 i did not understand
__label__3 it would be good if it had alot of tasks that are given by the app accordingly to your interest and even recommend books etc also if there was a competitive mode where you can see what level other players are and that to level up you have to do certain things that can be verified somehow for example read book requires a picture of a book with your face or run requires a tracking through the gps to actually verify yoy ran in this way it can even be competitive
__label__3 basic features for free pricy premium monthly subs for rarely used application
__label__3 add ability to have a dark theme
__label__4 i love the new widget it's finally useful please let us change the time when the day changes for example i go to bed at around 3am i consider any time before that to still be the technically previous day that completely messes up tasks that repeat after completion
__label__4 i just installed this gem of an app this morning and love its ease of use however there is a minor problem the date in big numbers on the left is one day behind the monthly calendar
__label__1 first thing i did when i installed the app was disable notifications and yet i still get constantly spammed with notifications all day long that aside the app is poorly made ui is very buggy chat functions are glitchy and don't update mezsages correctly sometimes the main ui responds to nothing you can switch tabs and nothing changes till you close and open the app again almost all fun and worth while content is locked behind a paywall or subscription
__label__1 i got the premium version the main drawbacks of this app are 1 i cannot customize the categories 2 if i do a task earlier it still alarming on scheduled alarming time 3 removing done tasks is not available just moved to the bottom
__label__5 awesome app very good at keeping me accountable
__label__4 really great tool helps me to know what do i spend my most time doing and i strongly recommend it to everyone it would be a better experience if they could add a feature to give me the freedom to organize my own forest and change the way my trees are put
__label__3 please add group feature not growing trees with friends but like a study group that shows everyone who is currently studying with you on the screen
__label__2 meh i left the meh on 2 2019 today is 3 2020 while the calendar is ok the themes never change and really are not anything of interest they really need to be completely changed also color coding helps me keep track of a lot of things i have going on the measley 7 or 8 colors they have are too few what no pink a nice hot pink so it will stand out i mean idk i'm still just meh
__label__4 i like this app it has a lot of the features i use all in one place however even though it lists all my google calendars i can't figure out how to do anything with them i have projects spread over a dozen calendars but i can't seem to add anything to any of them
__label__4 needs an easier way to switch from other task apps specifically common ones such as google tasks please add the functionality to import tasks lists reminders and events by logging in with a google account
__label__4 good organizer this apps is lovely to look at and good for scheduling it is more for idealized schedule as it does not really let you adjust during the day if something comes up overall good
__label__3 if more than one task is enabled for same time then it hangs i have to keep 1 min difference in both task pls fix it
__label__3 i do like this widget a lot however i left two stars blank for very specific features first and most importantly i left a star empty for the ability to display battery status on the widget as i use this as my primary smartwatch face thus without this feature it is very hard for me to see the status of my battery at a glance and know when i should try to get a little bit of charging the second feature is integration with outlook calendar without asking for permission for the entire account if it needs to ask for permissions at all as my workplace has very high security requirements for each of these features implemented i will add another star
__label__1 good app but does not respect do not disturb mode and keeps waking me up every night edit the issue is fixed giving the deserved 5 stars edit2 this is not fixed after all somehow this app not only not respects the do not disturb mode but also manages to send notifications one hour after i fell asleep today it sounded around 4 am
__label__1 great concept but executed poorly i added 2 events between 6 30am and 9 30 but when i tried adding one for 10 30am it would let me saying it overlapped with another event which it did not i even checked my calendar and nothing was there for that time it's now 11 42am i tried adding an event for 3 30pm and it said its saved but hasn't showed on the clock or anything so it's pretty useless at this point
__label__1 thought this was a great app until i realized it doesn't get rid of the checked daily tasks to remind you of the new daily tasks and that is exactly what i was using this for daily tasks i need done when i check remove checked tasks it does nothing and those checked tasks just stay there
__label__4 excellent app and honestly my life would be so disorganised without it really helps me to stay on track my only request would be to give me greater control over when events repeat than the current setup of every day week 2 weeks etc e g allow me to repeat events on weekdays or even better specific days like mondays and wednesdays for instance otherwise the app is sublime if this small detail is added then i see no reason to withhold my 5 start reading from you great app
__label__1 lacks task duplication
__label__4 good
__label__2 latest update has changed how to set a date and time and it's not great prefer the old version
__label__2 i'm very sorry i bought the full version so quickly the only benefit i found so far is the ability to add more than 7 habits i couldn't find a report that would provide information about my success and pinpoint areas that i seem to regularly miss i was drawn to the simple ui but will probably write this off as a waste of money and return to daily tasks
__label__5 i like this a lot ive been searching for this kinda app for so longggg
__label__2 great at first but now it's getting on my nerves i tried to create a routine for each day of the week today is monday and for some reason my monday routine shows up for tomorrow wednesday thursday and friday i've had daily routines show up on other days over the past week as well there seems to be a setting where i can change this but that doesn't seem to do the trick it shouldn't be this hard to have one daily routine for each day of the week uninstalled
__label__2 while changing list by scrolling right to left task get deleted it's very confusing
__label__1 5 up to 15 seconds are too much for staring at an add in an app that is listed under productivity already expecting the lame excuse given to all the comments please rethink if you want to go the standard way you mention or if a developer should try to give its best and attract users i'm in favour of ads in free app versions but this is too much
__label__3 this tool so cool for todo list
"__label__2 even after entering an event into the app it is not displaying on the 
clock face and it says 'no events' what's the point of the app when it 
doesn't do what it says it can"
__label__5 really useful and easy to use
__label__4 great simple app notifications can be better they pop out irrespective of whether goal was achieved and thus are useless
__label__4 the pomo section could be more useful if it has something like a timer you set the time you need to focus then do the job rather than just pomo where there is a fixed amount of time 25 minutes at default you know something like a focus timer i guess it would not be bad actually i think this might seem like copying a feature from other apps in your field but isn't it better if there's more functionality
__label__2 i think the free version of the app has some good capabilities but lacks some functionality that i desire functionality that i'm not sure exists in the paid version due to the lack of support for the product i was unable to find where i could go to ask questions thus the 2 star rating
__label__2 this app is either really good or really bad broken there are no in betweens i love the concept and its super cute but it bugs out quite a bit and besides which is super easy to misclick on as a result i've lost or accidentally lost items as well as accidentally spending nearly all of my coins completely on accident because there's no verification for buying and no refunding and that's besides the part where it constantly unequips all of my gear this game needs help
__label__1 i keep adding tasks its nit showing on widget very complicated to use
__label__5 excellent this is even better than wunderlist which i really loved they've taken it up another level brilliant cross platform tool for managing all my tasks
__label__3 lower rating until i use it more just started
__label__1 no custom notification sounds really
__label__1 need to be online to use this app in case you make changes in offline mode it doesn't sync automatically when online you need to again make those changes enable offline feature and offline data should be synced when ever we are online once this is done you got my 5 star
__label__4 highly recommended my only complaint is that the interface could use a little improvement as far as navigation and calendar access otherwise i love that lists are completely customizable
__label__3 won't update information from google calendar no matter what one event out of an entire day have restarted several times checked the permissions nothing update i think i understand what you mean i'll play with it for another day and will re rate
__label__4 very nice and useful would be even better to be able to set less than 12 hour cycle as series of short events inside short time period e g a few consecutive stand ups are not easy to see
__label__4 very easy to use however syncing with google calendar is slow for edits and deletes and this is the reason for not placing a 5 star rating
__label__3 great app but i have one issue my tasks that i create on my phone doesn't sync with google tasks how to fix it
__label__2 despite various updates to fix bugs the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on android the app beyond sign in still functions but that's it the game aspect is weak the app isn't very well designed and the tutorials tend to be broken on android as well i prefer apps like fabulous which i think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way
__label__5 awesome since we have online school i can use this for a schedule
__label__4 good apps but can be add more features
__label__3 it work absolutely fine but why every hour try to connect with facebook servers adguard noticed it
__label__2 i like the app it works it's functional and it's great however one thing still strikes me down why the hell are reminders a paid feature seriously what's a to do app without reminders i could use even my calendar or almost any other app and that would too have reminders for free so why should i pay for such a basic feature on a fully fledged app
__label__3 i really want to like this app but crashes a lot worse i deleted multiple messages at once and it deleted messages i didn't select
__label__5 excellent update thanks todoist team i would suggest customizing the font size on the widget as it seems small
__label__4 one star less because i can't find the windows version otherwise it is the best calendar
__label__4 i really like the app it has really helped me focus on study and work without distraction i love unlocking new trees from the coins you earn but i wish there were a little less expensive overall a really great free app
__label__5 awesome app improved my efficiency by 80 pros integrates with google cal awesome ui ux
__label__3 easy to use and calendar is useful i think its just a cash grab to pay for full month calendar view but other than that its great
__label__1 very disappointed about the recent update i had everything work fine till the update scrambled everything
__label__2 multiple account support without unified view really disappointing
__label__4 best to do app for me just one issue the pricing is too high for an app of this nature i want to pay once and forget
__label__2 not a movable app
__label__5 i could rate this app with 6 stars it is the best task manager app i've found ever and it is cross platform nice work
__label__2 its still asking me in an ad on the app to upgrade not cool
__label__4 i love how easy this app is to use the only disadvantage is that you can track only 5 habits for free if you want to use it for more you have to buy the pro but what it does it does well
__label__3 good
__label__3 great idea it needs some improvements imo edit after playing for a while i noticed some things that definitely need improvement faster loading times when changing sections or when receiving items you shouldn't have to refresh to see them that also applies when feeding pets where i dont see a progress in the bar unless i refresh etc
__label__2 pllllzzzzz make it for ios also
__label__5 best to do app i have found so far ms doesn't always get it right but they hit it out of the park with this one
__label__3 i like it but i would have liked to have the option of using it as a homepage like an interactive wallpaper secondly this should also be an android wear watch face
__label__3 clunky annoying lag time after button presses often won't update upon opening
__label__3 i wish it had a widget but i love it otherwise
__label__3 i love wunderlist one huge feature that to do is missing is i can't manually reorder individual tasks in the list i used to be able to move it up and down according to the order i want it done
__label__4 its a good app for everyday tasks it takes time to customize it and its normal because its an rpg type however i think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless you can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want this bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah
__label__5 very effective and user friendy got it connected to my gmail outlook en work environment
__label__4 so far so good
__label__1 i loved this app so much after i downloaded it and used it for about 2 weeks because i loved it so much i decided to purchase the pro full version and payed 4 99 however it was not worth paying at all i would have rather used the free version with the ads i will recommend everyone to download the app and use the free version but dont get the 4 99 ad free version because it doesn't really give you anything extra i would recommend the creator of the app to add more features for payed
__label__3 please add exchange tasks google like automatic scheduling would be a great add on
__label__1 any microsoft product should have zero stars available i cannot say strongly enough if you love crashes frustration and impossibly awful software then get this app imports from wunderlist do not stay put they disappeared shared lists are now two different lists with the same name one version shows only completed tasks my fone shows incomplete thanks bill for your 100 record of ruining everything you buy oh and 4 5 stars out of five i call bs look at the reviews
__label__2 i'm a student and was looking for something get myself very organized i have tried series of productivity apps before apparently this had one of the features i have always been looking for integration with other apps which i love two things i found disappointing features are extremely limited without premium it's almost impossible to use like that also very expensive i couldn't find statistics from totally hours and other reports
__label__2 almost what i need except there's no option to set a start end time with reminder for the start so it's useless for me
__label__1 please work on the navigation bar colour across the app on android 10 and make the status bar completely transparent just like on ios
__label__3 only 5 slots in free version and the reminders haven't worked so far otherwise a great idea
__label__1 doesn't seem to work on op 6t can go through character creation but doesnt let me customize or select anything half of the ui shows up blank
__label__4 been using it for years and now reducing to four stars the calendar side is great best out there but the task side is under designed and buggy i've reporting a bug for years and they've never fixed it
__label__3 nice idea but the widget's ain't showing on my home screen tried everything but hell doesn't works
__label__1 uninstalled not at all what i thought it was this entire app is basically just a fancy way to look at the calendars you already have everything syncs both ways so if you add your actually daily schedule minute by minute to this app you are also cluttering up your calendar s with the same things would've been neat if it actually had some kind of function but i don't need to waste sd card space on a calendar viewing app
__label__3 this app could have been the best i uninstalled it due to the widget error after restarting the phone it doesn't load i liked it but if it doesn't perform well on my need widget month calendar it's a nah
__label__4 i love the concept look of this mobile app the desktop version i wish i could set recurring tasks or add time reminders to tasks you also can't set reminders if you add an event directly into artful agenda you have to add it to your google calendar first to set the reminder then let it sync to artful agenda i've paid for the year subscription i'm really hoping it has more functionality by the end of my subscription or i won't be renewing
__label__3 the important smart list is all mixed up and doesn't show which list each task is from
__label__5 i love the app and the widget is very useful it's also nice to have my tasks and habits in the one place only feature i've found to be missing so far is to start the week on a monday instead of a sunday
__label__2 very complex ui it needs google calendar and doesn't work without it i needed a app like this but as a daily planner not just showing the calendar events from google calendar stupidly on a clock
__label__3 please ad an option to turn off check boxes on the widget since it was added i'm constantly checking off items by mistske once you do this it is tedious to get the item back
__label__5 great
__label__3 it's ok but it needs more features
__label__4 best habit tracker i've used notifications aren't consistent though
__label__2 many times i've put sub tasks on my to do tasks and they just disappear for some reason i've forgotten many things because of this and still hasn't been fixed despite various updates
__label__3 great for daily list used to use the grocery list used to had to turn it off due to spam if it continues i'll uninstall the app update clarify imo spam is getting items added to my grocery list that i don't want never buy it was the app telling me we've added xyz to your grocery list
__label__2 seems like it could be very helpful getting very frustrated with it always opening on monthly view even though i have weekly view selected in settings even tried switching it but no matter what opens on monthly
__label__3 i want to like it more but whenever i set an event in the calendar it always starts it the following day for example if i set an event from thursday to sunday it saves it as friday to monday
__label__3 full of promise but the lack of word wrapping means task detail is hidden particularly bad for sub tasks where the font is also larger and therefore exacerbates the issue if and when this is resolved i'll be able to use the app and give a more balanced appraisal
__label__3 great i just wish i can move it to another device with out having to by it again
__label__3 it's really only useful if you are doing recurring tasks at the same time on the same days etc i set up a lot of tags categories but they can only be applied to the routines not events or reminders i was also not able to copy duplicate events which would have allowed me to reuse the same tasks at different times or days without setting up a brand new event disappointed in the app's scheduling capabilities
__label__4 only used for a day but it's the best app i've found for daily tasks to do lists would love to see the following 1 completed tasks move to the bottom 2 tasks be linked to a numerical value 3 the ability to order each item manually daily
__label__5 very customizable planner easy to navigate but not basic i love it thanks to the creators you guys really did a nice job
__label__3 the simple layout makes navigation easy and intuitive i decided to try this as an alternative to google calendar and whislt its integration of ai assistants and task tracking seems very good as a calendar i have to say im not impressed looking at the calendar from a months perspective doesnt show at a glance which days you have something happening rather below the calendar is a schedule view which shows you what events you have which i find confusing would be nice to view by month
__label__3 this app really helpful to focus on your task before i update forest for the last version the tree always dies if i open other apps but after i updated the tree is still growing although i open other apps
__label__3 good could be much better missing the critical feature to sort first alphabetically and then display all incomplete tasks before all complete tasks also should have an option for the tasks in the to do lists to not appear as tasks in outlook exchange
__label__2 the app was working fine until it started bugging out recently and showing me the wrong dailies going back to using just the website now until this is fixed
__label__4 nothing important but some time innocently surprise made me stronger
__label__4 the app is a great concept helping me keep track of goals and be motivated to do the things i need to in a day friendly competition and cooperation keep things interesting and encouraging quests are wonderful long term motivation along with the goal of filling the stable it is discouraging frustrating and hurtful when i try to check off dailies or do anything on the app and it doesn't let me because of connection failures i lost health overnight because it didn't let me check off my dailies especially frustrating during quests myself and friends all have the connection problems in different locations on data or wifi at the same time fixes are quick and interactions responses pleasant great app
__label__3 i actually loooooove the app and use it to organise my life but it has now stopped updating as a widget if i make changes to my lists on the app it will not change on the widget
__label__2 the free version is pretty minimal
__label__4 it's been a good way to get things done and the concept of an rpg is very well executed the reason for 4 out of 5 is simply regarding the interface my wife uses it on ios and it is light years beyond what we have on android much cleaner more useful information and less clunkiness
__label__2 app looks good but failed to import from wunderlist twice now forced to manually re enter several dozen tasks wunderlist works flawlessly so wondering why retire it
__label__1 ticktick is much better
__label__3 glitchy but good
__label__1 it wouldn't let me try the app it just told me to subscribe
__label__3 would be better if it didn't rely solely on google calendar great concept but would prefer adding events directly to the clock myself rather than having to put it on google calendar first
__label__1 would be nice if you could import tasks from other applications but not only is that a problem but importing from a previous version of tasks is impossible too nevermind i'll just stick to what i got
__label__3 great app new adds not so much
__label__2 too much configuration not very intuitive i'm looking for something simple that only counts something for the day not to set goals reminders notes and all that overload of information that keep jumping from screen to screen not looking for enterprise app just for personal use
__label__1 too difficult to figure out how to set up can't add times to daily routines this app is a waste of space
__label__2 fantastic app a critical flaw one touch completion now when you brush the screen your tasks get set to complete and you can't find them easily updated july 25 the developer asked me to respond to comment thanks for responding don't fuss on my part
__label__2 using google pixel 2 and paid for full version sometimes the day on the calendar doesn't update i dont want to have to restart my phone everday a workaround would be to press the refresh button on the calendar but i dont like having to do that every day
__label__3 really great app but it sucks that you have to get premium to get the most basic feature notifications for a timed reminder
__label__3 good
__label__3 good
__label__3 this is hands down the best personal planning app i've ever come across that being said it's basically unusable on android the view jumps to the top of the day's task list at random making it easy to accidentally check off the wrong task it takes minutes to load anything when you try to access the rest of the app through the back arrow at the top left and on occasion tasks will duplicate themselves multiple times with different parameters i use it on my ipad with no trouble at all
__label__5 honestly it's perfect but theres just one thing i really wish you could set a habit for 'complete x times a week' it would be so useful i have yet to find an app that is this good but that is the only shortcoming please add this i mean of course you dont have to but it would be amazing
__label__1 mandatory registration
__label__4 good for studying
__label__3 much better since my last review in 2015 right now easily the best to do app out there all the issues i faced back then are gone one thing that makes this a 4 star above average app rather than 3 average is the automatic inclusion of past due tasks in today list of course if it's past due it has to be due today somehow most to do apps miss this 5 stars will be when or if they actually release the google assistant integration and it actually works without issues that zapier stuff though what a joke if anyone has the time to deal with that they have plenty of extra time and have no need for a to do app also including zapier as a premium feature with zapier itself requiring an expensive subscription to actually work is a pretty damn dick move yea just thought about this again and this dick move costs 1 star pay 10 for a 1 star extra dlc
__label__2 i bought the previous version and can't use this one full version if not bought too which i think is not ok well why would i have to kip old application i understand but i don't like the idea to have duplicated apps but i raised the reading to 2 starts cause of that
__label__4 i'd give this a five star if not for the backing up which prevents importing mismatched versions kinda redundant if we can't use the backup that we took two weeks prior
__label__3 easy to use and calendar is useful i think its just a cash grab to pay for full month calendar view but other than that its great
__label__5 verry good
__label__5 i love how it says what the task is
__label__1 i do not like the functionality of the app i found it is very easy to delete a sub list but if you create a second list i could not figure out how to delete it after going through all settings i also did not like the fact that you can only add one item within the sub list other people may be okay with these nuances but for me it's not i only use this app for about a half an hour and then deleted it
__label__5 love it it has completely changed my life i couldn't have become more adult like without habitica
__label__3 not really the app that i was looking for but ok
__label__4 good luck
__label__4 only thing missing from this tool is an in app calendar
__label__1 after few months it started not checking the task i mean i check and few hours later it is unchecked it should be cleared and the next date for the same task should be displayed example task 1 to date 01 jan 2019 and repeat task 1 to date 01 feb 2019 after checking the task for january the task for february should be displayed but after some time the task for january is unchecked
__label__3 please make checkbox rectangle its wierd to have a circle checkbox feel like a bullet point but its not
__label__1 my app keeps stopping and then i loose my points
__label__4 incredible app with serious problems of synchronization
__label__2 does not support more than only one outlook calendar
__label__4 i just tried this app and i am already compelled to buy the premium version i think this app has many potential please make more simple ui so that when we're looking at timeline it doesn't feel so cluttered a minimal look will be so much better look forward to more addition to the app and more great features
__label__2 what happened to all those data i had not able to log also
__label__5 i just adore this app it has saved my sanity on more than one occasion super simple to use and i love being able to color code things and the water tracker my goodness
__label__2 looking as everyone else's very ve reviews i seem to be the odd one out but i didn't find it straightforward it is too easy to delete a list on my s9 at least with even a slight bit of a swipe once deleted it is lost why not have a 'back' or 'undo' button personally i don't find the heading group list structure particularly straightforward although i've now got used to it
__label__2 i tried the free version i liked the way that you are writing the day to remind you and it set itself but the free version doesn't support calendar and for me this is a big minus i prefer to use google task app that signs up with calendar and reminds you for the task
__label__1 online sync is no longer working and last update was june 2018 which is more than a year is there a reason why i should continue using this app
__label__3 just didnt use it
__label__1 sync doesn't work paid for premium had to get a new phone and it won't transfer as other reviews say it seems this app has been abandoned unfortunate because i liked it
__label__2 too whacked for creating lists like grocery or to do with their tasks and subtasks instead of just lists you can check complete
__label__2 how to use bakwas i am vrry an gry
__label__2 with so many free calendar apps out there there's just nothing in the free version of this one to make you choose it the only feature that might set it apart from the competition is the project feature but you have to pay to use it sure you have the notes feature but there are ways to accomplish the same thing in pretty much any other calendar so i just can't see the point rather than pay for an upgrade to an app that's just ho hum the view isn't even very customizable i'll be uninstalling
__label__1 i do not like the functionality of the app i found it is very easy to delete a sub list but if you create a second list i could not figure out how to delete it after going through all settings i also did not like the fact that you can only add one item within the sub list other people may be okay with these nuances but for me it's not i only use this app for about a half an hour and then deleted it
__label__3 this app need to be more compeleted
__label__1 it sync the google task once thereafter no more sync dissappointed
__label__2 the check boxes could be bigger and other such things could be made clearer also an option to see all the items in individual folder from the 4 3 weekly widget
__label__4 i really like the app but i don't know if i'm using it to its fullest potential has any on made a tutorial
__label__4 why on earth when i'm on one day and create a task it schedules it for the day before that by default just why
__label__1 doesn't allow you to do a samsung back up and restore
__label__5 super cute functional it syncs with both my personal google and work outlook calendars space to plan priorities and meals weekly daily views and lists i don't use the stickers as much but all the colors for events and background are enough for me right now can't wait for the widget to come out someday
__label__3 need to pay to track more than 5 habits and ui doesn't look simple or impressive
__label__4 great app very easy to schedule i think it would be great if there is a button from the notification panel that allows muting of all events for the rest of the day another feature could be the user can push forward or backwards the whole timetable or pushing forward the event and shortening another from the popup for unexpected event that delays everything
__label__4 easy to use and very useful especially spending lots of time at home at the moment
__label__5 очень удобно идеальное приложение можно сортировать и организовывать записи выбирать цвета для задач темы
__label__4 its a very good app however i guess its desktop version is not available if they have it will be a great organizing app great app
__label__2 having issues with syncing with google calendar i added a task on ticktick and it's been over 12 hours and it still has not sync up to my google calendar i've tried refreshing but nothing showed up i've looked at the help forum and many people have the same issue for some time now i just purchased the pro and it's not worth it if it doesn't sync
__label__3 it's such a great app but i can't receive any notifications of planting reminder
__label__1 i am unable to subscribe app payment method declined
__label__3 the app is great i wanted to use this app as a way to help me to creat a better habit and staying on track with certain things for me the notifications don't work unles i open the app and by that point its like my reminders have passed other then that easy app to use and navigate
__label__4 good app
__label__5 literally i am blessed to know todoist
__label__4 so far so good easy sync with google calendars however i can't tell if the to do lists can sync with other programs like wunderlist or the voice assistants like google or alexa
__label__2 all of my records get deleted automatically
__label__2 as much as i love the concept and i really do want to use it the app doesn't log my times i'll plant and study then when i come back and my tree is supposed to be done growing it'll just start up like nothing happened i've had an empty forest for two days now
__label__3 this app is a very playful app i use this app as a game but i have faced some problems using this app i can use other apps phone based app given by phone authority while 'forest' app is active in the background but on some apps the apps i have installed by myself the forest app does its job when i get into other apps the tree i have planted on forest app should have died but the forest app is not working on phone based app given by phone authority
__label__1 i really didn't understand the interface and its too complicated
__label__3 for me good app
__label__2 app seems ok but they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar it let's you view the current week anything else and you have to pay so many free ones out there to choose from uninstalling
__label__3 there is scope of improvement to make it easier
__label__4 крутое приложение вероятно перейду на премиум подписку тем не менее есть один нюанс что мне не понравился и пока не смог найти решение когда в проекте создаёшь задачу и для нее указываешь под задачи то они отображаются с отступом если все эти под задачи назначить на выполнение на определенную дату то во вкладке today все задачи будут отображаться одним сплошным списком без какого либо визуального разделения на задачи и под задачи
__label__3 pretty average app
__label__5 great app helps me get things done and work on building better habits even better when you have a party going with friends would be nice if the app had a dark mode that's my only suggestion keep up the good work
__label__3 like to check off sub task via widget without opening app checking off task without subtasks works fine wish widget showed calendar wish app had daily weekly monthly yearly trends wish app to sync to google calendar would be nice if you could rearrange the components of a list ex move note below subtasks btw 3 of 5 is to me a strong like you guys are doing a great job
__label__2 the app is great for the schedule but the tasks needs work i should be able to schedule something to repeat every day but it doesn't allow for that option and it doesn't always register the repeats had to pay for the yearly subscription to find out it doesnt even work stick with the free version least youre not wasting your money will have to try something else for my tasks and the developer doesn't care
__label__3 this app keeps crashing on my samsung galaxy s8 kindly fix this bug because otherwise i love the app and the idea it really helps me with me being productive
__label__5 it is a very nice app it remixes you and you will never miss any task it reminds you with alarm or notification it really helped me
__label__4 good app lots of customization but i have noticed an issue with repeating sub tasks if a subtask is set to repeat it won't complete the main task seems to complete fine if the subtasks are not set repeat
__label__2 confused i planted a tree but instead of killing the tree i can just leave it running in the background and the tree still grows
__label__5 this is the best app for me to stay focus
__label__5 brilliant app helps me to keep track of everything i'm doing
__label__5 trying dont hack
__label__5 amazing app for staying focused
__label__5 dose what it says on the tin it would be great if they could add a timetable page to it otherwise i think it's very useful
__label__1 horrible experince glitchy and slow with no user friendly interface waste of time to download check it out and uninstall after 10 minutes on top of that the most important features are paid but wait its a subscription to pay 4 monthly for a todo app which can't do something better than the hundreds free or those with one time payments cannot recommend to anyone
__label__5 i love this app unique style that looks great on any of my devices
__label__3 try
__label__5 great for time management and visualization of one's next 12 hours thanks guys this is a must have
__label__4 however there are a few bugs every so often one of my recurring tasks will appear twice on one day and i have to delete it the synchronization with drop box isn't good enough to use on two devices i would be useful if you could choose 'third sunday of every month' for recurring tasks
__label__3 this is pretty great but has what i think is a major bug in the settings you can choose a default for reminders so i choose an hour before that means to me that if i say something is at 2pm it will remind me at 1pm however instead ticktick sets the task for 3pm and the reminder for 2pm this is obviously wrong fix that and its 5 stars but as it stands i now have to set each reminder individually which is a pain
__label__1 i loaded the app on to my amazon fire it will only display horizontally and i dont have the export option even though i have the premium subscription i can't export my task list either
__label__2 a chore to figure out
__label__4 great app i would like more progression content resetting levels is easy implementation but gets stale quickly mages do too much damage but this app had been transformative and amazing i will consider contributing to development
__label__5 just started using it i'm very organized working from home during this pandemic is easier with the task to do list app
__label__1 app didn't work at all was buggy from the start of my sign up where i used my google account to login
__label__3 has the potential to be an excellent all in one calendar and to do list however i cancelled my subscription two weeks in as 1 subtasks automatically repeat when repeating main task is completed regardless of time and due date settings this should be optional 2 subtask reminders should be optional 3 calendar functions are very limited e g ability to set up an event rather than a task would be a valuable addition
__label__3 i think its a nice app a nice initiative
__label__4 i really like this app its a lovely interface simple to use and very useful to have both tasks and notes with the calendar is there any possibility of adding a folder tag category function to the notes it would be so helpful i make notes on a varietu of things as i go along and its really useful to be able to store them by day but it would also be great to be able to sort them by tags or folders anyway just a suggestion otherwise a lovely app thanks
__label__2 decent app but does not seem to be able to sync with my google calendar without that it is pretty useless to me i like that sub tasks are listed as an indent to the main task not as a seperate task
__label__1 i have 10 notifications on my home screen and no clue what they are for or how to find out
__label__4 this app is so good
__label__4 best habit tracker app i have used
__label__4 i really like it so far i did have one problem where i checked off a task i had completed that was a weekly task and then the following week it did not show up on my list because it had deactivated somehow i'm sure they will fix it soon
__label__3 overall the app is pretty good i have a few complaints but they don't imapct the basic usefulness of the app 1 the app doesn't make a noise when a reminder comes up 2 it has been sporadic and may not keep a reminder posted even when it hasn't been marked complete 3 the format for setting a reminder day is clunky recurring reminders are especially difficult and may not even be available for example there is no way to set a recurring reminder to every 6 months
__label__3 the app is great wish the premium version was cheaper though 3 49 per month is just too much
__label__5 its a good app for focusing in studies
__label__4 todoist is really useful if you have a variety of tasks that you need to carry out but don't want to write it down on pen and paper
__label__3 paid the 2 99 for the calendar sync as i really needed that and found that it didn't work however they quickly refunded my money and the issue may have been with the compatibility of my phone
__label__3 it's good but you can only have 5 habits to track if you want more in displease because it's like a demo but nobody tells you
__label__3 i am a long time user and lover of wunderlis the predecessor of this app and i like the new concept i was using the old app as a to do list as well but there are a few things i take issue with 1 you cannot reange the order of your tasks 2 in every list you have to check the box make finished tasks invisible visible the combination of the 2 make it impossible to stay organized i hope they fix this stuff soon i don't see any reason why this isn't already a feature
__label__5 i absolutely love this app it definitely helps me stay on track with my all of my home school home work due the covid 19 it helps me stay off other apps because i definitely dont want my tree to die overall this is my new most important app because of me being such a procrastinator i surely recommend for people like me who easily get of track a lot
__label__3 5 stars if option available that will allow tasks to automatically show under my day for the due date or reminder date scheduled
__label__3 the to do list should allow prioritizing tasks by importance and urgency it would be great if you could add that
__label__5 intuitive fast easy only my custom colors get messed up every once in a while between b c and google but i don't know who's fault that is
__label__4 still needs some work to get it up to par with wunderlist but works ok
__label__3 i love this app i use it for everything except every new day the widget is blank i go to the app check the list confirm i have things to do go back to my homescreen and it is still blank
__label__4 ok so i bought a pro version it is a decent app but has some issues i created a few routines but when using programmer i can't apply them based on day of the week instead i have to choose date for example on every monday wednesday and friday i have a different routine but on tuesday and thursday i have a different one but using programmer i can't apply routine based on day of week have to choose a date instead
__label__1 i used to like this then the updated it to include something called in inbox which is just ruining it for me i dont need that its making it confusing to keep track of things i will be replacing this with another app
__label__2 having problems the app is not syncing anymore with my google calendar i double checked the settings gs and permissions and tried to force a sync still no good it is set to auto sync every 3 hours
__label__1 add a way to change the color scheme of the app blue on white is one of the most difficult colour sets to see you bought wunderlist and are making everyone change over to it at least give us the option to reskin the app
__label__1 when microsoft announced they were killing wunderlist my expectations for the new thing were soooo low i was spot on bloody hell its it's awful look how wunderlist works 1 new items are added to the top 2 completed items are struck through _and_ moved to the bottom and remain in completed order 3 highlighted items are bounced to the top which can then be un highlighted 4 items with low importance remain at the end with _long_ lists old un completed or permanent items migrate to the end of the list try a usability test with long lists
__label__4 it took me a while to understand how to use certain features but once i did i found it to be exactly what i needed if google would allow reminders to come through it would be the perfect time management tool my only thought would be if there was some sort of tutorial or guide to help know what some things were for like when i'm changing the color scheme i can't always tell what's what for those not wanting their calendar clogged up just make those things hidden after you've added them
__label__1 used to love it but the latest version broke it couldn't get it to work all widget face buttons would work for a few seconds then break tried all settings didn't work fix it and i'll reconsider my rating
__label__1 this app keeps stopping everytime i have to reinstall it to use though i have pro version and the problem still persists even i have coomplained about this long before
__label__4 it's a great app to stay focused but sometimes i use my phone to go on google or use google translate or dictionary and other things that i need to do my work i think the app should let us choose which apps can be an exception because phones are sometimes very important in doing our work restrict only games and social media
__label__1 too complicated
__label__3 cool app but widgets stopped working so makes it pointless to keep
__label__3 i love this app i would really love an option to check off or mark that a task was complete
__label__3 the app notification doesn't go away even after ticking the task complete otherwise an amazing app
__label__5 love it especially the natural language e g write every tuesday friday do then it will automatically repeat every tuesday friday
__label__2 bug that says 'path 'type' is required' everytime i try to do something i tried submittinf an error report through menu about report a bug but i get the same error message when i try report the bug
__label__4 meh doesn't have dark mode easier on the eyes that's the one thing that breaks it for me
__label__3 i love wunderlist too bad need to transfer to microsoft to do ui seems boring i tend to forget to use this app just make it similar to wunderlist the color wallpaper etc microsoft ui is too simple dark is too dark bright is too boring not customizable either please improve it
__label__1 not close to do list all features available bin premium mode only
__label__3 must be a better reminder system to keep user in check in a busy schedule one might forget to check in
__label__3 juat started using this and although it seems to do most of what i need i think it has some basic things missing
__label__4 i still feel like it's more complicated than necessary but it is good for special projects
__label__3 this app used to be helpful now it doesn't give me notifications unless i open the app when i do open the app i am slammed with overlapping reminders i have tried everything in the settings but nothing has helped i like all the other aspects of this app so it's a shame that the one thing i need it for doesn't work any more
__label__3 please allow line wrap for a event tile in the month widget and or month style display
__label__3 i didn't like the way the lists would set up
__label__2 was a good app but the 'improvements' made have made it fairly useless especially the widget i don't pay premium prices to have an app get worse please restore
__label__1 just an unwanted extension of calendar
__label__2 i loved the concept but i study from my phone so whenever i am opening my downloaded files it's killing my tree
__label__1 date no time
__label__3 sometimes it shows wrong time make me confused most of the time
__label__5 works very well on android phones does not have a steep learning curve
__label__4 it is a very handy app but the fact that premium is required to enable reminders kills the productivity boost i wanted to achieve
__label__5 useful to improve like goals
__label__3 not free
__label__3 been a user of the app for 5 years has been helpful in managing a busy life up until recently would have given 5 stars three stars because of poor app support i think i have finally worked out my issue but disappointed in level and responsiveness of support just hope you never need support
__label__3 its simple but it works
__label__2 says free its not free its a demo for a paid app be warned
__label__4 looks cool and i like the stats i would like to have a monthly and yearly calendar display on which dates with non repeating tasks scheduled are bold or otherwise highlighted or preferably have the tasks listed in small font in the box for that day in monthly view and when you click on the date have all tasks for that day display why do none of the life rpg apps i've tried not have calendars it's bothersome to add something to a calendar and then open up another app and add it in again
__label__5 the application is great the ui is clean easy to follow it does exactly what it is intended to do i have one suggestion alongside the possibility to add steps to the tasks it would be great to be able to arbitrarily set the level of completion of one task with something like a slider say for example you set yourself the goal to watch a full youtube playlist everyday you move this task to my day you will want to be able to measure your progress each day without predefined steps
__label__4 took a bit of time to learn but so far its a great app definitely appreciate the ability to set passive or more aggressive reminders
__label__1 used it until simple backup was premiumized restore wont work between different versions unless you modi hack the file author would not tell you that you can do it though if you ask his help restore dont recognize my backup file at all so all my lists are basically inaccessible now will never install this again and i suggest anyone who values his data not to
__label__5 super cool app to organize your day it reminds you all the time to keep up with your schedule a great app to change your way from unorganized to better organized
__label__5 this applications are all there setting up you routine for the day and you can set appointments in advance
__label__1 uninstall app that wants sell me every small feature done
__label__1 worse
__label__5 make my day to day that much easier
__label__1 confusing and definitely didn't motivate me to do tasks just spent hours trying to figure out how to add personalized tasks
__label__3 i love this app but it sucks that i can only use it on my phone i'd give it a 5 if i could a use a desktop version of the app as well b sync tasks with wunderlist and c sync reminders from google calendar as tasks on planner pro
__label__4 the widget shows only 1 list item is there any way to enable multiple lists viewing in widget mode
__label__5 i really like ticktick i have a decent memory but as a day goes on there is always something missed i always set a task if i know it needs to get done amd and its done not to mention i have never had a single issue with the app not working
__label__1 update problem fixed did you people just do another update because the app is completely screwed up it can't recognize that my phone is connected to the internet
__label__4 nice will be better if app has got inhabit counter for example count of pushups or exercise i need it but app is very nice i will be recommend it
__label__2 there's a bug with the planning view you can't see the title of the event other than that the app runs okay
__label__5 most productive application
__label__4 very helpful and detailed app love it
__label__4 sure could use a completed tasks tab i hide my completed tasks in tabs as it just gets messy and when i wanna check what is done i gotta manually untick the hide completed and then tick it again i'd also appreciate if you could see when the task was completed overall a great multiplatform tool been using it since i found it
__label__2 stupid auto correct
__label__5 this is an awesome app i initially thought the idea of gamifying my life was a little silly but fun after trying for two weeks it is far more motivating than i ever thought thank you this is finally getting me into habits i have been trying to develop i one thing i have difficulty with is the subtasks once i complete the subtasks they don't carry over to the next day's parent task however the rest of the features of this app are so great you still get 5 stars
__label__3 good
__label__3 task management is a bit dangerous can forget to enable a list also can't figure out a way to view a single list without disabling all other lists which ties into first point
__label__2 it doesn't ring to notify me
__label__5 great app a section to keep track of birthdays anniversaries addresses would be a great addition
__label__4 great distillation point for my mind maps app is very simple interface to a reasonable amount of credible task tracking functionality
__label__3 i am still testing it out but so far do good i like that there is a possibility to organize tasks according to thier importance and nature
__label__3 its ok
__label__5 an amazing app with a creative concept one of the best task managing apps out there
__label__1 it is not opening after the update when i click on it it says forest keeps stopping
__label__1 newest update nerfs the widget so you can't utilize as much functionality to it the main app also features the annoying swipe to select feature now the previous click to select was fine and this new change doesn't add anything only creates a new barrier of frustration
__label__4 only thing missing is being able to check off each task event i'd like to know that i am making progress of keeping the routine or of i need to tweak the routines a bit
__label__1 just installed keyed in all tasks n to do list server error lost everything redo server error lost kept repeating frustrating uninstalled
__label__5 such a amazing app keep track of ur life
__label__3 laggy
__label__3 functional nothing special
__label__5 i love this habit app and the customization ootions i use it to track exercise and also build up break habits im trying to start stop
__label__5 love it
__label__3 it seems it is not designed for android users it is look like iphone application for me thats why i didn't give 5 stars
__label__2 seems pretty good but most of the options that make if stand out are not available unless you pay for it splendo is cleaner and easier to use
__label__4 such an amazing app really helps me focus and keep myself on track with my assignments only con is buying coins but you can save them up over time
__label__2 paid for this years ago and used it on another device now i have a new phone and when i'm trying to login it says my email address is not in the database
__label__3 purchased thr app as a replacement of the simple calendar widget but it has no advantages over it
__label__2 i was keeping track of christmas gifts by checking then off once they were purchased and looking back by selecting show completed tasks until today when i went to check and they are all deleted kind of a bummer it was convenient that the purchased gifts were hidden and nobody could snoop on my phone unless they knew to select that option but now i have to go through my hidden gift stash which if you are a parent you know how immpossible that can be with kids around all the time
__label__3 pretty good overall notifications and reminders do not work most of the time
__label__2 keeps me on top of things
__label__2 the sad thing is that it didn't allow to sync data it requires pro version to be purchased
__label__2 such a scam first it asks you to sign up for making duration related reminder once you sign up it says that you got pay money for that features deleted this app at the next moment of seeing those scam stuffs
__label__5 love the idea of life as a videogame
__label__5 i have tried a lot of these types of apps hands down any do is the best im terms of user friendliness user experience and what have you gonna buy and would recommend the same thank you any do my head is a lot less noisy now
__label__3 the app is great but after using awhile it start to lag
__label__4 fun and engaging way to track your goals and form better habits i'm still not great at keeping up with it but the app works well when i spend the time to pay attention to it
__label__5 very flexible task list best widget easily share your tasks this app encoraged me to organize my tasks and share details with my friends and colleagues
__label__2 it's just okay
__label__1 recent addition of very intrusive full screen video ads has crossed a line at first i thought my phone had been hacked i totally understand need for revenue for a great free app but this is too much i'm going elsewhere very soon without a change
__label__3 uninstalled do to app starting randomly
__label__2 sadly the ui isn't adapted for the pixel 3 xl
__label__5 this game app is so easy to use and so much fun thank u so much for making habitica
__label__5 much better than wunderlist
__label__5 fab app and helps everyone to stay on the track i love the reminders
__label__5 helpful
__label__3 it's ok but new trees are way too expensive and only few change their form with the time passing you can also pay with app coins to buy sounds which are available all over the internet including other apps i would love for the developers to add new features tho
__label__3 good app but some feature are to be updated still like it should actually calculate the petcentage of work done by us on each task and should be more attractive i think so
__label__3 waiting for you to fix the widget issues namely parsing p and smart date
__label__2 the idea is brilliant but the apps do not work on my phones i changed the apps to another apps and forest keep growing pls fix this
__label__5 taco
__label__5 love this app my favorite part is the helpful and intuitive snooze feature on tasks quick preset time ranges or ability to get specific make reminders easy to manage
__label__5 hebrew language doesn't work
__label__3 the app is really good but after some time it keeps stopping i reinstalled it two times and the third time also the problem persists i was forced to uninstall it finally
__label__3 it's such a spectacular idea but i had trouble figuring out all of the different aspects and it was just too much for putting in tasks on a day to day basis
__label__3 would be 5 stars because it's really great the best calendar i've ever used but it keeps losing things i enter where i have poor reception it's like it thinks it has uploaded them and then forgets them somehow
__label__4 the only drawback of this app is that you need to add events or tasks or routine to your google calendar in order for it to show it in the app it would be great if such events could be added on the app itself
__label__4 such a cool app i'm in love with it sad that it doesn't work properly offline though also has bugs
__label__3 it didnt sync with the widget overall it great app
__label__3 this is a decent time managment app the ability to create routines is handy though it doesnt warn you or show if activities are overlapping the most recent update as of 3 30 2020 made the app look much cleaner which is nice i would like to see more personalization options t'wards the look af the tags and app choices now are very slim the 5 price tag for the pro version doesn't feel worth it yes buyer's remorse so if you can manage fine with the free version stick with that
__label__3 nice idea
__label__4 the app idea is great but the actual app is kinda slow and a bit confusing to get around the concept is very simple yet the user interface is way too complex and has many features that i bet nobody really uses less buttons more trees
__label__4 i love this app i have always been a franklin covey planner gal and this is similar to the paper planner great search function
__label__5 has helped me to stay engaged with my to dos in a workable and fun way love this app
__label__3 i like the layout and it looks promising but i have at least 20 google subcalendars so i can color code things and keep them separate and it can at best display part of 1 no google tasks show up at all i could be doing something wrong but there are very few options and everytime i go to the app it reverts to the wrong google account on my tab
__label__2 i hate when the things are no clear basic features as reminders are in the premium membership
__label__3 im facing an issue please i have subscribed to your pro version and paid money google play unfortunately im still an free user the money debited from the bank can you please help me
__label__3 the idea behind it its very good but it wont even let me log in
__label__4 pretty easy to use and reliable still trying to figure out the ins and outs but it's been fairly easy to pick up
__label__4 have difficulty trying to set multiple appts for the same time on different days too complicated just want to input what days of the week i want the appt for
__label__4 i think it's a great app and a lot of fun i had some trouble figuring things out at first but everything works the only complaint i would have is the cost it would be nice to have some of the features but they are too expensive
__label__1 this app is to complicated
__label__4 i haven't started using it officially but i'm giving a 4 star because the user interface is on point i'm starting my habits on monday hopefully the functionality part will be as user friendly as the ui thank you
"__label__4 just a couple of things i don't like the fact that the reminders show 
up multiple times and i wish it had a to do list but other than that 
but other than that so far so good"
__label__5 great app helped me get my time optimized and scheduled thank you very much developers 1 suggestion would be to add auto backup on the cloud through google and so on
__label__5 good make me full organized life
__label__3 ok it's sending hundreds of notifications with no end after an update yesterday
__label__2 would like to change my my class and chat is impossible to navigate a simple notification system would make it easy
__label__5 omg i love this app
__label__4 make some more widgets rest all app is nice and user friendly
__label__2 there should be a dark mode instead of setting through a premium theme option
__label__4 it's a nice applications but it should also have a button for completing before time give up then ends up killing the tree and hence loss of progress of the forest
__label__1 great idea but doesn't show all events for the day doesn't show events in designated colours all look the same doesn't show repeat events no use really i'm removing it from my phone
__label__1 cool visual but doesn't work the way i thought it would i don't like organizing my hour by hour tasks through my calendar because it clutters it up and makes me miss my important events i wanted to use this app thinking that it would allow me to plan my dialy tasks just through the app but every time i want to plan an event it forces me to do it through my calendar which i don't like good concept but i don't see a reason to use it since it just wants me to use my calendar anyway
__label__4 i needed a calendar that would extend my schedule to infinity and with multiple rotation scenarios for a variety of store visits it does that great is it possible to simplify moving events which actually are my store visits to other days within the same week or month it wud be great if you could just drag the store you missed to another day and it would only change that single event not the rest in the rotation thanks
__label__4 this is pure magic juat saying best life app out there keep up the great work im ao happy you listen to your customers edit now my entire household is using this app its amazing magic easy to use only thing i noticed is that when you claim a reward if it has an increasing cost sometimes it will spend the gold after the increase instead of before resulting in extra gold loss my best guess is that the script might be changing the cost value before subtracting the gold from the players gold
__label__3 i bought the pro version in hope i can organize my time to do my tasks but the progrmer just disables the routine that's all really the other thing i didn't like was to set a routine for a reoccurring like school or sleep i had to set it for every single day one by one you could have add a reapet feature to it i'm not happy i wish i could get my money back
__label__5 fantastic task list for personal and teams calendar pomodoro timer and habit tracker this one app does pretty much everything it's fantastic
__label__2 i cant set my times for events bc theres no am pm option it keeps changing my time not allowing me to put the right thing annoying
__label__5 i love this app
__label__5 helps me be organised it's great that it has no ads thanks stephen i really like the icon on my home screen as well a little thing but it cheers me up to look at it i originally gave the app 4 stars only because i don't like committing myself to 5 but on reflection i think you deserve full points i haven't explored all the features yet so will get back to you when i do
__label__4 on android it still won't let me add tasks to top of list where the list actually opens
__label__5 i love gamification at work creating a simple customizable system for home life is great
__label__1 cancer notifications i denied the app permissions it asked for one time when trying to change the notification sound now it is impossible to change or mute the sound no matter what setting i change inside or outside the app and whether or not i give the app the permissions it wanted 4 stars when this is fixed
__label__2 why doesnt the widget remember to sort by date i have to keep going into the app to select sort by date can this be fixed
__label__2 i found the white text against many of the colors very difficult to read
__label__3 cool app but widgets stopped working so makes it pointless to keep
__label__3 quite good but the week widget is imho absolutely wrong the order of the weekdays should be first vertical then horisontal i e tuesday under monday not to the right
__label__3 it is good sometime app does not work properly intimation not shown on time
__label__3 cant view a month in one screen one week is the maximum that it will show uninstalled
__label__4 nāo tem a opçāo de sub tarefas
__label__3 not for me
__label__2 useful
__label__3 still trying
__label__3 the app was awesome but it stopped working in a week i'm not able to add any routine now
__label__2 used to be a great app but i've moved phones but the sync did not work and all tracking data has been lost even after having paid 18 for premium very much a shame
__label__4 very useful and easy to use
__label__4 i had a problem with upgrading to premium they were quick with their response and fixed the problem right away it's a good app for those familiar with the franklin covey system and syncs well across devices
__label__4 helpful for those who are visual or have a hard time grasping timeframes still learning all the features demo mode is helpful but a full tutorial video would be more helpful
__label__2 there's no simple reminders or ability to add to do task everything has to be added via calendar which is irritating me app is useless right now
__label__2 somehow reminder function has never work no notification or anything which make this app kinda useless
__label__4 some premium features should be free otherwise good tool to manage one's projects
__label__4 good functionality and integration with gmail alerts work as they should have used it for nearly 6 months with no problems
__label__1 in recurrent tasks if i skip marking one of them as done it doesn't remind me the next time say after a week or next day if the repetition is set to daily
__label__1 the two starting pages were blank same as character customization i saw another comment and there's any new version to update i was excited to try this app but i couldn't
__label__1 the pop up advertisements make the free version impossible to use i will be forced to change to a different app after years of use
__label__1 quiero cancelar mi suscripción porque pensé que sólo se pagaba de una vez y de contado pero me la están cobrando mensualmente en 24 cuotas que no acepté no hay información sobre cómo darse de baja
__label__2 used to be good until last update now i can't login to see any of my tasks appointments or notes edit now works since newest update but i have lost all previous tasks and notes very disappointed
__label__3 i wanted this for my tablet and like the features like tasks a calendar etc but i'm disappointed it is locked on landscape position instead of allowing it to rotate to portrait position if they fixed that one detail it would be a winner for me
__label__2 migrated from wunderlist can't share my list with my spouse always gets errors todo list unusable without sharing working 1 for dark theme though
__label__4 it's pretty good i wish you could change the type of selector though yes no vs x times a day after habit creation it seems there is no way to do this yet
__label__5 i love this app it's a perfect replacement for my paper calendar i love that i can have my schedule meal plan tasks to do and more all at the tip of my fingers wherever i am i'm excited for all the plans they have to add even more awesome features
__label__4 i would add notes to subtasks
__label__4 good app just one suggestion consider putting a weekly template with times on the side its much easier to follow and visually appealing
__label__3 this app is fine in concept but the game part of habitica arguably the reason you would use this app over other habit tracking apps is just too boring and not that gamey to me which doesn't keep me motivated to keep going back to the app for my habits concept is good execution leaves much to be desired
__label__3 could be improved dramatically considering i'm in love wit microsoft
__label__3 the aap good but not some updates are required such as in notes section add photo upload option add journal option
__label__4 although it's very helpful but make a navbar of all the lists or try to show all the lists in list format when we open the app so that we can see which lists are there
__label__4 one of the best todo apps i'm not using the full version just basic as single user for me the only failing is i want more options on recurring dates e g 14th of each month except jan feb
__label__2 main issues to solve 1 in the icon app there isn't the indication of current day would be very useful to have it instead of the standard bc violet icon 2 there isn't the possibility to set two different time zone in the fields from and to in the same event it would be very useful to set fights event with different time zone 3 the location link should be synchronised with google maps results not with the contacts in order to have the right response for the addresses please update
__label__5 i like but i am still trying to figure out how to assign a task to me in the assign to me instructions given does not work
__label__2 28 oct 2018 same problem repeating tasks do not update and advance to next due date when completed checks it as done and then unchecks sometime at night with previous due date 27 oct 2018 after hearing back from the author giving it another shot put two repeating tasks on it see how it goes 27 oct 2018 this app didn't work as well for me it would regularly uncheck tasks i'd completed or check tasks i'd not completed the repeating task function didn't work well either
__label__5 i really like this app it has many options for personal organization and is more helpful than any other app i've tried yet
__label__3 the app crashes very often you also have to restart the app every time for a reward to show up in your inventory
__label__2 i have had this for years and even have the pro version today the application is staying i do not have pro when i go to on app purchase it even detects purchased but will not give access to pro features
__label__3 it crashes everytime i open it whenever i go one day without using it
__label__5 helps me at work soooo much perfect program can't think of anything that would make it better i'm a type a list maker love it
__label__4 have re defined my routines and activities working well
__label__2 has potential but made no sense i didn't know what the hell i was doing needs more explanation and help
__label__4 i have been looking for a well done app that has checklists that allow sublists this app is well organized and easy to understand how to use i do have a couple future feature additions i would like to see that i will send to the developer but i am quite happy with this app
__label__3 i've just installed this app and will definitely play with it in the next few weeks it really looks nice and really structured so far my only surprise is that there's no female icon for the person only nuns or dancers but not a simple female icon that doesn't do anything just stands hello is this app exclusively for men or is the icon hidden somewhere
__label__5 this is a great app i love gardening and this app also explained me about different plants and also has a timer
__label__4 this is a simple app that gives me the capability of creating a to do list set event on my calendar and take notes
__label__5 very helpful
__label__5 this app has done wonders in helping get things done and it make it fun
__label__3 why do you get rid of things after making users use to it what happened to the press and hold to multi select why can't i type 'tomorrow' and click backspace to remove the auto calendar add like i was able to before the update thanks for the new features but don't take out the old ones or at least add an option in the settings to keep things the same
__label__2 why its suddenly requesting to access my phone location information i didnt see any concern for this app to access location information and when i rejected the app wont launch at all keep sending me to my homescreen dev better have an explanation b4 i do something as im a forest pro user i didnt pay to have fishy app here replying to u dev how im gonna do that if i cant even open it bcs i will never give my location access to u
__label__2 love the app would love a version for windows chrome to use on pc also i bought a premium version and now when i opened the app after 4 months it has reset itself to the non premium version
__label__5 very much featured app this app is all i need to manage my time
__label__4 useful app
__label__1 i'd rather have continous ads than a payed time subscription honestly the subscription seems pretty shady for somethng you can easily do yourself 3 69 for a month subscription and 36 bucks for a yearly subscription seriously why not just pay a premium one time payment costing 10 pathetic
__label__2 i used to love it it was my go to app for many years but over the time it is losing the special status it doesn't have travel time anymore which was the main reason why i could stay on top of things without mentally having to calculate each meeting and setting the times they removed that
__label__3 apparently i rated this app one star this time last year but i don't remember what the issue was so whatever you guys did up to now with improving the app is good unfortunately i'm heavily dependent on having a calendar view not google calendar integration but rather an option to display days via calendar so until it's put into the app i will be uninstalling and standing by for the update
__label__1 it's so nice very productive
__label__1 could be as good as wunderlist was but please change the new tasks to appear at the top of the lists
__label__3 great app but please give an option to disable checkboxes i hit them all the time by accident and there's no undo on the widget
__label__3 time zones not supported missed a meeting today
__label__4 this is a great app and i love it bit i have two small issues with it first i don't like how insistent it is with notifying you to complete tasks second i wish the interface had a better tutorial so that it would be easier to have the due dates and such easy to prepare when you enter the task in since fixing one would fix both this is still a great app
__label__5 this is just what i was needing i love it only one thing i'd change please make the colored calendar dots larger thanks
__label__3 it it good but i couldn't do simple lists they would be in one big catagory then in a sub list and it just wasn't the format i wanted
__label__5 supper helpful for me as a busy college student i often forget all the things i have to do each day and this helps me visualize what's next i want to get an android wear just to have this app also on my wrist it's that helpful also i just bought pro and i love the colors please keep the support and updates coming thanks
__label__1 decent but premium features like sync do not work can't even reimport data you exported yourself had i realized this i would have never have bought the app it's just false advertising i now have to figure out how to port my data to another app where it won't be inevitably lost
__label__3 a intenção é boa mas a interface é bastante confusa the intention is good but the interface is too confusing
__label__5 beautiful large text and easy to use well done
__label__5 realizing wunderlist was going away was unfortunate but this app does a great job at replacing it i really like the graphics and the background image of the needle
__label__3 i liked how i could customize everything but my linked google fit didnt update my steps i had to input myself and my notifications would only go off if i opened the app myself kind of defeats the purpose of linking and setting up notifications
__label__2 app is unable to manage recurring tasks app has almost everything but it fails on managing recurring task after setting the task to be of repeat type marking task completed for a specific day is marking entire task as completed and for this only reason i had to uninstall please make necessary changes and inform
__label__4 the widget sometimes shows my list as empty and it always need to be removed and replace to show the content of the list properly
__label__2 first time opening good experience everything from google calendar was synced then stacked up my events for the day opened the app a few hours later and absolutely everything was blank and you have to pay 7 to be able to drag and drop your events
__label__5 great way to visualize daily schedule in a more intuitive way
__label__3 i love this app it's the only one that looks and feels like the old franklin planner however since the latest update i have a banner ad on the bottom of the screen with google ads and i am a paid pro user this is extremely annoying if they don't remove this i'm leaving
__label__3 its a good app but it stopped working on my phone and i have already paid the amount what to do
__label__3 love the tracking love the accountability i use the widget but i dont like that you can't split habits into profile type structures for example an am routine list of check offs and a pm routine maybe those and a list of habits you just want to complete daily at any time that would be a game changer for me i've considered other apps because of that one missing feature i dont like how the widget groups every single habit into one list i want to split habits up between multiple
__label__4 nice design but have been a happy wunderlist customer for a long time and the feature very important to me being able to sort my list with a long press and slide up or down made it fast and easy to prioritize my day and make quick changes the inbox was also a feature which was very important to me and gave me the confidence of not losing important info while on the fly i realize that microsoft to do is not wunderlist but hoping for these features to be restored
__label__4 it's very simple to use you can make your list easily and remind your tasks at the moment thank's
__label__3 kindly add daily focus time feature when we open monthly or yearly focus daily focus time is available in many free pomodoro apps i dono why it is npt available even in paid version
__label__3 the most important features needed 1 a multiple sort features like alphabetical then by priority date etc we are talking about very organized people using these lists 2 a data import and export feature to backup import lists csv files so the 500k people who used listmaster can transition to your app while keeping our info safe if our phone dies or is lost or stolen 3 a feature to attach files or pictures make all of these additional features for 1 month to get monthly income
__label__3 please fix the crash
__label__2 wish it didn't force me to use google calendar i wanted to start a new calender off of this app
__label__3 i paid for the premium app and still get mashed to do a review
__label__3 mainly i want the option to have a bigger font i forgot to cancel after the free week so i guess i am stuck with it for a year but the only reason i wanted to cancel thus otherwise good app is the font size 7 3 19 i did not want to increase the font size of all the other apps etc on my phone in order to increase this one the others were an adequate size since i could not change the size of the font internally to the app i ended up not using it at all and now i am cancelling
__label__1 edit still doesn't work i suggest adding proper integration with outlook because it is leaps and bounds ahead of google in terms of usability and ease before edit doesn't show me the events already listed on my outlook calendar every day is blank when i go to add an event with only outlook calendar selected it wants me to add an event into another calendar i don't care about adding events i can do it on another platform but if can't even see my outlook events then this is useless gave it all necessary permissions and checked dates and synced
__label__1 can i get a refund
__label__1 recent major update has strongly impeded on usability of app i understand and appreciate the focus on subtasks and some other features however i think the developers have severely misjudged the actual most common user stories was always a big fan paid subscriber for many years but this update was a major letdown unnecessary changes for something that was working almost perfectly
"__label__2 play voice option does not work consistently it regularly does not sound 
the vocal reminder this is a function i rely on how do i contact you to 
discuss further"
__label__1 i personally like this structure but unfortunately it's on accessible and it doesn't work with talkback well so blind people can't use this app it doesn't read different sections and different buttons please improve your accessibility
__label__5 an app that is simple to use and well built speaking from everything i've asked of it so far
__label__3 i would give it a 5 but i recently got a new phone and i cannot sync at all i really needed it to sync very disappointed because i followed all the steps in my email please help
__label__3 notifications do not show up thought i have enabled all permissions and to override dnd the notifications and reminders do not work
__label__1 does not sync automatically very frustrating have to go in and sync now even though setting is set to sync every hour done with this app
__label__2 when you use the pomo timer it automatically starts counting down when you hit what task you want yo be working on there is no longer an icon where you can choose your white noise before starting the pomo and no way to pause the pomo once it starts so you can select your white noise i would like to be able to select the task i'm working on select what white noise i want and then start the pomo not everything automatically start
__label__4 i was looking for an organizer app which would provide statistics on my discipline and progress and this does it but it is missing one to me basic feature the tasks don't have a start time or duration period there is only a deadline it doesn't allow understanding easily whether the tasks overlap in time is this feature available in the premium version at least another missing feature is the location setting at least at a home work outdoors level any plans to incorporate the features
__label__1 when i star the item from the widget it doesn't move it to the top automatically i have to manually open the app and move around order defeats the purpose of a widget
__label__5 es great good enough for me to use it to help fix my sleeping pattern
__label__2 awful ux ui i don't like how you have to use a rigid syntax to set recurrence for tasks i like old fashioned controls but todoist is just trying to be different for no reason was on premium for several months and gave it a fair shot needless to say i cancelled my subscription and switched to ticktick instead i don't normally downvote apps but this just didn't do it for me and i spent money on it i should have ignored the hype so the fault is mine
__label__1 7 day trail but you have to fill all or card details and take subscription worst trick
__label__3 it's good but when do you open the app and see all habits you can't know what is the habits that do you need to do in that day today i mean i have some habits that i just do once a week friday but when i see all habits on a wednesday for example i see that habit there like if i should do that on the wednesday would be nice just see the habits that you need to do today you can do this
__label__2 this app is really very good but notifications aren't working i tried everything it told me to do but it's still not working
__label__1 i went through all the stuff to link this to my google assistant but it doesn't work right i can get it to add a task supposedly but when i tell it to read my tasks it says i have no tasks for today and doesn't give me any way to list the complete set of tasks the ones i just added this is worthless
__label__1 don't download after installation my calendar was full of commercials you won an iphone events with alarms
__label__2 the minimum timer is 5 mins so useless for me i had hoped to use this as an exercise timer i need alternating time countdowns running consecutively e g 3m 30s 3m 1m 5m 1m plus a reminder for when my favorite combat sports are on tv i'll keep looking
__label__4 i wish there was an option to create a to do list for tomorrow like i wish there was a my tomorrow that would turn into my day instead of me having to manually add all the things i wrote the day before if that makes sense
__label__3 pretty average app
__label__1 i almost never leave reviews but for this transition i have to make an exception wunderlist has been my most frequently used app being in daily use to manage my busy days the todo version is hopeless to use i like to use a weekly list which no longer exists it's replacement does not allow drag and drop to different days worse if you manually change the date of a task it doesn't move to the new day it remains in the original day with a completion different date must be fixed
__label__5 total game changer no glitches on the mobile version excellent filtering capabilities used it for 270 straight days and counting
__label__5 this app is just what i have been looking for it really feels like a paper planner
__label__5 this is a very creative app to keep me amused with my versa 2 fitbit and to keep me productive when doing tasks around the house excellent job creating this app keep up the great work two thumbs up
__label__4 it is easy to use i am sure i have more to learn though i just wish that the color coding would show on the home page when i open one list i can see it's color but not until i open it
__label__5 i don't have this app for long but it is really easy to use so i like it it also allows you to skip a day if you can't do it that day just change the day
__label__2 update the app crashes everyday and i have to reinstall it and customize my settings everyday i have a premium account but still this happens please help this app is life transforming i've been using it everyday for four to five hours and i'm getting so much more done i love it the only issue is that it crashes frequently and i need to keep uninstalling it and then reinstalling it it'd be great if the developers looked into that
__label__4 very useful and functional
__label__5 it looks awesome i hope it will help me build good habbits and keep track on my schedule i wish it could be like a widget on android phone screen as well and maybe we could write some quotes that motivates us we could see them as notification or something i love the guild part looks like you can create communities and be part of them i just download the app today and wanted to share my first impression well done
__label__4 every other month i think i'll do better i try again i download this app everything gets back in order so i uninstall it to free up space in my storage then i relapse i download the app again this is a never ending cycle of desperation loss and hope i will always download this app i will always uninstall it 9 10 would recommend
__label__1 update 2 19 2020 i cant recommend this app to anyone the smart date parsing only works reliably if you enter it using military time also the fact that you have to enable alarm mode to have reminders fire on time is ridiculous i have many apps that push notifications on time and don't require that so the developers don't know how to do reminders correctly horrible app
__label__2 two bugs right at the beginning of registration first two images didn't load on the three slides intro then when registering my info it moved to the next screen but gave a name error and i couldn't make an avatar not a good first impression just deleted my account thru the website
__label__3 i do not understand how i will add events i tried adding events but it only shows up in my calendar not at the sectograph it seems to be useful but i need to know how to make it work
__label__5 i love the interface and the colors it's very smooth and fun to look at
__label__3 the concept is great and it's a fun way to keep track of your habits my only gripes are i wish there was a better way to see habit streaks the number is cool but if we could see it on a calendar like view i think that would be helpful you could miss a day and if streaks aren't set to reset the number remains unchanged better explanation of the colors on streaks i still don't know what they mean going to google it you can't use rogue skills because you get a blue screen
__label__4 fantastic app great layout and super helpful editing entire routines can still be a bit cumbersome but it's better than any other routine calendar daily scheduling app i've used
__label__2 doesn't let you choose specific calendar events to ignore no way to track how you actually spent your time if it didn't match your calendar
__label__4 crashes when i customize my hero status
__label__4 compared to google tasks it's overly complicated and too many menus to set simple things like dates and times
__label__3 love the app but i have a question in the options under daily tasks we can choose between daily or weekly what's the difference
__label__2 the app has stopped synching and cant get it working very frustrating i paid for premium and no one replies to help resolve which is a real shame as the actual app when working is very good
__label__1 the ads now pop up full screen that is very very very very annoying what if i'm on an important call making an appointment and then you pop up this irrelevant ad right in my face unprofessional
__label__4 regular user since 2years 5 mar 20 what can be done to ensure outlook calendar always syncs it never seems to work more than a few days after which i have to manually sync to keep it upto date this is a big bummer as business calendars are mostly on outlook across majority corporations
__label__3 needs an in app guide to make the user understand how it works update i really appreciate you responding and working on it thanks
__label__3 i wish i could delete things that automatically show up in my calendar things like holidays in other countries etc i don't want everything showing up that really doesn't pertain to me if there is a way i haven't found it
__label__5 awesome app
__label__3 events disappear
__label__2 while swiping towards right the tasks are getting deleted at least it should ask for confirmation whether the delete is happening accidentally or we really want to delete
__label__4 app is great it's simple enough to use what would be great is the ability to add in a password protect function for any notes you enter in also 1 thing that annoys me hence the 3stars is that i find more often than not that when i type words the preview screen truncates the first 2 3 letters and replaces them with dots developer very quick responding to feedback
__label__3 music doesn't play as notification of reminder hate it i had skipped my one routine
__label__3 i know one of the selling points was minimalism but it feels way too minimal to me any real useful functionality is locked behind a paywall
__label__4 really cute app and i love it but i wish there was a feature where you can pause the timer take a short break then resume studying it'll be really nice
__label__5 just what i was looking for google calendar is good enough but it doesn't have this this is what i needed now i can see all the hours that i have free during the week
__label__4 great app could be better if i could have the same habit with multiple notification times so i can do it several times a day without having to recreate the habit several times thanks
__label__2 over all good task manager but i do not like misleading and untrue boasts about integration with ms outlook it is possible but only via zappier plus functionality is limited not possible to sync task between this 2apps
__label__4 nice app bug with achievement exp gained it only adds on to current hero exp without leveling up eg 144exp 25exp why does skill decay even after doing a task that increases it
__label__5 easy to use free version is enough for my purposes
__label__5 very well made and easy to use
__label__3 great colors list notes with sub lists lots of options but terrible to navigate very confusing and all over the place if you want something very detailed will spend the time to learn to use it and want tons of colors to differiate your lists then this is for you
__label__3 when the system is set to dark theme the home screen widget fails to display the list correctly
__label__4 pretty good app that helps me stay organized could use a few improvements but overall i enjoy it
__label__5 the last update is great but i find the search function needs to improve i prefer like the old bcpro or like the samsung stock calendar i use very often the search funtion and when i need it i have to go to the samsung stock app i prefer that in search all events with the key words should be displayed instant not needing to ask for past of future years that would make this app really 5 stars thanks
__label__4 it's good overall it has a variety of cute options for trees i had some issues with an alarm i'd forgotten about going off from another app causing a tree to die unless i watched an ad it takes a long time to get enough coins to buy other trees there isn't a formula available to estimate how long it would take discouraging i liked the idea that was posted about having animals get drawn to healthy forests over time i wanted pro several times but don't trust myself with whitelist
__label__5 thanks stephen great app i'm naturally scattered and fast paced and this app helps ensure nothing falls through the cracks
__label__5 really easy to use you can go back to catch up on habits you left unfinished for previous days
__label__3 idk if its my phone android but i dont receive push notifications nor reminder for this app
__label__3 app itself is nice but needs a lot of polish right now it's kind of a bugfest
__label__1 the new full screen video advertisements make the basic version of this app unusable i'm looking looking for a replacement
__label__2 i liked wunderlist much more i can't arrange the tasks in the list freely it looks like there is something wrong because i can arrange some lists and couldn't for others and the starred list which is switched to important is just a long list i liked how it was divided before it is really disappointing
__label__5 good app for students
__label__3 on wunderlist your starred prioritsed list would break down into the original lists they came from now they all melt together on the starred prioritised list you could also reshuffle jobs by holding down now you can't
__label__2 doesn't do what i need it to do with setting recurring alarms such as every 3 hours forever it just says how many times do you want this to repeat but doesn't let you choose hourly just daily weekly etc
__label__5 i love the concept i've always saw the parallel between reallife and an rrg in terms of skill growth and education
__label__1 i really love this app and recommend it to anyone but since i went premium nothing works i can't go to the shop section or see my achievements i hope they'll fix those issues with an update soon only 1 star because of the issues otherwise would have been 5 stars
__label__3 i like it paying month after month for premium features isn't for me though
__label__4 so far it's pretty good i've been using it about a week sometimes it doesn't refresh but the other users on the app seem positive and friendly there is a lot that i am learning through users that isn't actually explained in the app like if you don't do all your daily tasks the whole party takes damage so yeah no pressure it would be nice for a better help options or a more detailed in app fist time training learning session every 'first' should option for more info
__label__2 i am not receiving my notifications on any of my tasks projects i have scheduled so i end up missing out on things i want to take care of i have it turned on in settings why is that i utilize the smart schedule tool but still no notification pls help or fix
__label__1 i cant no longer recommend this cant sign up on any platform and they servers are located in asia i wouldnt put any sensitive information on it they have nothing but server issues its very fischy
__label__4 its your calendar on a clock best if you have a smart watch i dont but still a great app if your a visual person 5 star if i ever get a smart watch
__label__4 clear and nice design works perfectly it would be great when calendar synchronization would also export routines to my calendar so i am able to manage my routines in the app but main events in the calendar app with blocked time of routines
__label__1 kicks me out of the game instantly not for me
__label__3 the current release doesn't sync appoinments i make in the app to my google calendar it only copies the online calendar events to the app
__label__5 this is a great app it's helped me stay on task with everything i need to get done
__label__3 average at best needs undo option or on touch and that task is lost among all the other completed tasks needs links between tasks so dates can push out or come in very basic most will find themselves wanting more from a tasking app
__label__3 pretty good could be better
__label__2 disappointing i have been happily using this application for years now but the last few updates appear to have caused more problems than they fixed one example when you create an event that's further away than a month the app will at all times change the date and time to incorrect ones it has done this each time for me over the last months changing the dates and times for no reason you can imagine this is a deal breaker for a planning app
__label__3 it would be better if there is an option in which we are able to check whether we really followed time table or not
__label__3 easy to use decent integration one major flaw in the shopping list no way of entering quantities schoolboy error
__label__2 very simple app to track your progress towards acquiring a habit the only downside is that you can't sync the app as it says no internet connection when there absolutely is also together with this bug all forums are no longer available as well as daily quotes it's just gone previous rating was 5 stars but with this bug continuing for half a year now i can only give 2 stars
__label__1 many times i've used the app for over 65 minutes and every time it'd just freeze and shut down when only 1 second is left doesn't plant the tree and doesn't give me the coins i'm disappointed upset that i still can't save up for the treehouse that i want
__label__2 hi i am using vivo v5 plus handset i had downloaded todoist for quick reminder but your application does not remind me on time set for work if screen is idle and notify only when i turn on screen kindly help me in this regard
__label__3 it's a great app and has definitely helped me maintain my habits i had been gifted premium early on but i've found that the features have disappeared and i'm only seeing the base version i like it enough that i want to buy it but i worry about whether it will keep the features based on my experience and other reviews i've also found a bug when i have a goal set to 3x a week as success the app doesn't recognize when i've had a successful streak and always shows as 0 successes in the streak section whereas it's at 80 in the percent success section and many weeks of meeting my goal
__label__3 love the program and it's definitely an improvement over google calendar just the easy moving back and forth between dates using the 'go to' feature is a huge plus in my book it does have some short comings that are irritating to me at least i use my calendar to keep track of my to do lists i save them in the description field first off the editing features such as bolding underlining line numbering etc don't appear anywhere unless like in my case you accidently discover them by doing a couple of steps of bizarre gymnastics once found i loved the features however the first thing that is annoying is that if you have a long list of things that go past one screen you have to keep scrolling down to access those features would be nice if there was a button or tab that would open a stationary bar at the top or a floating window that moves with the screen second issue is definitely a software bug having to do with the line numbering once a line numbering list has been established and you want to go back to add a new line or change the priority by moving things up and down the system does odd things
__label__3 its good nd loved it but need to more developed
__label__2 widget freezes app does not sync i had a galaxy s7 edge and just got an s10 app fails with both phones regret spending money on this
__label__1 good concept but whenever i open the shop it says error code 668 i tryed redownloading and it didn't work
"__label__1 don't bother unless you pay them 7 99yr they don't offer a 
trial suspicious and you get no access to features without paying too 
many other apps just like this that are much cheaper and let you try the 
pay version before paying"
__label__5 this is bad ass i really love the originality of the concept
__label__2 pretty with nice add ons and integrations but more than once i've gone back to a long list i created to find it gone or reverted back to a very old version so annoying don't need the song and dance this app offers if it can't save a basic list
__label__1 hard to use if we could make some changes just by sliding the clock or smthn that would be awesome
__label__4 i like it but i wish i could go to the days ahead and see everything planned instead of what is just at or ahead of the time right now for example it is 5pm right now and i can only see what's happening after 5pm tomorrow
__label__3 it seems like a good app but i haven't found a way to enable a permanent notification for quick task adding is it only possible edit no i mean a permanent notification that works like your widget allowing to quickly add new tasks without opening the app splendo and any do have this feature for instance
__label__3 lebih suka tampilan aplikasi yang lama karena lebih mudah digunakan diatur daripada harus terus scroll ke bawah untuk melihat hari berikutnya
__label__4 so far so good i love creating my own adventure still learning some of the functions maybe a tips video could help i can't wait to see what other fun things can be added more community or friends list or leader board then get us to do in app purchases for new items or level streaks i just like this a bunch so thank you
__label__3 im so confused with this app
__label__2 kind of boring
__label__4 great app for task reminders reminders notifications works well easy to use
__label__2 very simple app to track your progress towards acquiring a habit the only downside is that you can't sync the app as it says no internet connection when there absolutely is also together with this bug all forums are no longer available as well as daily quotes it's just gone previous rating was 5 stars but with this bug continuing for half a year now i can only give 2 stars
__label__3 won't do recurring tasks does not connect to gtasks as shown in the cover photo hasn't been updated in a long time
__label__5 this is a fantastic app with a fantastic community love this game helped me start sleeping on time and drink water anything that you can imagine for yourself it can help you do
__label__5 the app is splendid i love it helps me to plane my day and my work ahead of time and reminds me of what i had planned to do this makes me to be effective in my life i can easily access my to do list where ever i go
__label__1 cannot change themes anymore missing notifications liked it previously
__label__5 great app motivates you to keep going
__label__4 useful
__label__5 i absolutely love this app i am a very ocd person when it comes to being organized and love my planner but really wanted something digital very portable and environmentally friendly i found it here i love the way it syncs in seconds across my devices phone ipad google home device and laptop it s super user friendly and very customizable i tried several other digital planners and this one beats them hands down
__label__3 used it in the past and wasn't too happy with it tried it again and now i have no idea why i didn't like it before i especially love the integration of the to do task list within the app i use the agenda view on the widget and couldn't be more pleased as the title says i love it several years later and still living it wouldn't think of changing it for anything rating dropped from 5 to 3 stars too many features removed with recent updates
__label__4 very good
"__label__3 uhm there's a little bug that i encountered i cannot disable the skill 
decay pls fix i'll give 5 stars"
__label__5 it's beautiful i love the premium version thanks
__label__3 timezone feature broken the gamification was a little too complicated and too much for my needs
__label__3 it's not clear how much it cost the premium account also every time i try to go premium i get a message saying the in app billing are not available on this device i've always do in app purchasing and it was the first time that i got this issue really disappointed
__label__1 i wasted my time and money because it doesn't sync to my watch i spent hours trying to get it to work i emailed the developer a few times but it took a few emails before he realized that his program doesn't sync to the gears s3
__label__2 it stops sending notifications randomly
__label__5 so convenient easy to use a real game changer for me in managing my home business home life simultaneously
__label__3 it would help me to better schedule my tasks if the feature to repeat a task could be made to be more fluid i e instead of only allowing users to key in every week every day etc it would be better if it allows aug 28 oct 5 nov 11
__label__5 hey friends your draw over other apps isn't working on huawei latest emui anymore
__label__2 great idea in principle but it's so hard to work out what's going on that that so far it's useless
__label__4 i just downloaded this the free version was definitely useful but i went ahead and got the paid version because i wanted to use the repetitive tasks and weekly planner as well i definitely think this will be worth the purchase
__label__5 any app made well and affective for the needs of the many should be free of limited access and ability to help them actually acjhieve the goals they have set like limit 3 5 habits to track go premium and you go for as many goals as you want hhhmmmm anyone catching the psychological aspect of limiting a person by a marketing suggestion it's cool the app functioms as it should i t is us as humans that need to work godspeed
__label__3 it's actually sleek beautiful well designed and exactly what i would want but without syncing it becomes much less helpful as soon as that feature is added i will reinstall this as my primary note app
__label__1 wow had a 30 second ad that gave me the uninstall this app command i used to like the 1st but eventually moved to the 2nd but after that atrocious ad i uninstalled and used google calendar which the widget is not as nice but works great
__label__4 for those coming from wunderlist to transfer your data log on to a computer not a phone or tablet to transfer your data if you're having transfer trouble seems similar to the glory that was wunderlist but still not as good
__label__3 its a very good game and i like it but to buy most things in the game you have to get gems or a subscription which you both to pay for also i don't seem to get anything when i purchase the enchanted armoire
__label__3 been using for a while now getting buggy needs update
__label__3 very useful and simple nothing too fancy but still fun no complicated features i love the multiple lists options and sub category lists only glitch i find is returning to previous pages after typing often i have to just hit my home button and navigate all the way back to where i was but nothing too bad
__label__3 overall it works but not so easy to use when you block out time the first and last day of the time block do not turn the same color as the rest so it can throw you off sometimes it's hard to set specific dates and the icons are limited
__label__1 i am unable to download this app it downloads uptil 82 and then stops i have a android device
__label__4 easy to use
__label__3 kindly add daily focus time feature when we open monthly or yearly focus daily focus time is available in many free pomodoro apps i dono why it is npt available even in paid version
__label__3 i love the overall concept and the diverse options for setup though so many setting options are a little overwhelming to sort out i've had the app for a few weeks and i am still trying tweak my layout visuals are everything for me i believe when originally setting up a few weeks ago i was a bit annoyed to have spent time choosing colors for the widget to find out it is a premium feature to developer plz be upfront on the premium feature options i think once i get it really working for me it will be a fave app
__label__2 boring and not very effective for me the visual design is a bit of a yawn and it's too hard to earn rewards without paying if it works for you great but it doesn't give me enough gratification
__label__5 i like i can set daily tasks and on going habits i found this feature useful
__label__2 calendar setting are changing from one day to another has to reset them everyday plus widget settings is separated from the app setting which is somehow cumbersome
__label__5 like
__label__3 ok
__label__5 love it lets you make multiple lists and lets you move items up and down to prioritize most useful out of several to do list apps i've tried
__label__4 i really enjoy this app because it stops me from sitting on my butt 24 7
__label__3 i found this app difficult to use that's just my personal opinion i uninstalled it and got a different one that is easier to use
__label__1 only reviewing so the app stops asking me to do so even when i do review the app still asks me 3 stars to 1
__label__1 not sync with google calendar
__label__4 good works offline so i love that but one improvement they must include is to allow us to have a hierarchy in projects else it is too cluttered
__label__2 purchased app palette when i try to use it app stops every time
__label__3 no internet connection all the time
__label__3 didnt work out for me
__label__1 i loved this app i've been using it for years today i have updated it and mh2 premium account just vanished now it prompts me to buy premium again what happened could you help me please after a few years and after the second time paying for a premium membership and after no one reacted to my complaint my premium membership and all my data vanished again without any backup as promised this happens everytime i buy a new phone very dissapointing i will not fur sure buy a third premium
__label__3 still exploring the app but so far so good
__label__1 i can't synchronized to my calendar
__label__2 overall it's a great app that i use every day but what i truly hate is i paid for the full version and since i have 3 google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions i'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize i bought it because it defaults to the wrong account if they fix and let me select correct amount i'll bump my rating back up should have an option sad
__label__3 it's fairly easy to use however the alarm doesn't work
__label__5 really good i woul like to export my data but other than that i love it
__label__4 i bought the full version its a fun app to challenge yourself i would like to see an update gives you the choice to choose a pen or pencil icon or a book icon which seem to be missing that would be useful for example if you want to write a book it would be nice to have a book icon or pen icon or pencil icon update i seem them now thanks for responding and letting me know looks like i needed to scroll farther down to see them
__label__1 swipe to delete is terrible takes almost 5 swipes so work rendering the app useless
__label__3 it seems like a really nice app but some functionality is broken when i add routine delete few items it merges in wrong way so some days become small while others have 34 hours
__label__3 on wunderlist your starred prioritsed list would break down into the original lists they came from now they all melt together on the starred prioritised list you could also reshuffle jobs by holding down now you can't
__label__5 despite its bad ux on the web e g it's a pain to add tasks to projects trello like shortcuts would help i like this app a lot
__label__4 i love this app the only change i wish they would make is that certain words and all numbers become dates that the app tries to make into a deadline sometimes i just want to write the word tomorrow without it thinking that i want to do that task by tomorrow or on tomorrow for example
__label__2 the motivational messages are annoying you can only track up to 5 habits in the free version but it is totally not worth paying for more good riddance i suppo this kind of app is just not for me
__label__4 good replacement for wunderlist missing the possibility to create to do by sending email
__label__1 widget is not working will show up but then it freezes and you can't do much with it only remove it
__label__2 i really love this app but i can't find any way to make it work on my new huawei y7 phone i've followed all the instructions in the faq and tutorials online but my trees still continue to grow regardless of whatever other apps i'm using i hope this compatibility issue is possible to fix and that it gets fixed soon because i absolutely love this app otherwise
__label__3 great
__label__4 i was so pleased with the new habit tracker as well as using a true dark mode however i don't agree with the premium policy as i prefer to make a bigger one time payment such as when i bought final cut pro x with apple instead of a small recurring subscription that makes me want to go back to todoist it's a damn shame as i liked ticktick so much i'm willing to pay for premium unfortunately the subscription policy is an easy deal breaker
__label__1 won't connect to server will rate better when this issue is fixed i'm using a samsung galaxy note 8
__label__2 please make a home screen where it shows your active main tasks allowing you to just press and view them without having to click the top left button snd select this would be very convenient thank you
__label__3 its crashes all the time so help me in this case
__label__3 synching between my chromebook and phone is a necessity for me and does not work on this app the color coding for completed tasks is not intuitive
__label__5 best calendar app ive ever used has a lot of preferences to suite your needs but i would like to suggest if possible for the all day events to be able to change their order sequence that would be awesome
__label__4 overall good and works well syncs with google calendar and is a little easier to work with
__label__3 missing integration with google calendar
__label__5 it's helping me a lot to deal with my anxiety
__label__2 repeats tick now however i encountered another problem there's no way to restore purchases meaning if you subscribe and than reset wipe the app or your phone you can't use the subscription features anymore and to get it back you have to completely resubscribe
__label__1 good
__label__3 really great concept but not much useful and not even that beautifully eye catching thing
__label__3 a lot of bugs for an app that tells you to pay to support its development
__label__4 i haven't had any problems with it so far just wish it had a tutorial so i can get the most from it without buying it
__label__3 the whitelist feature doesn't seems to be working otherwise there is not a thing wrong with this app it's absolutely amazing so helpful and motivating
__label__3 a good app but a reoccurring price model is not the way forward i would like a one off charge around 5 euros would be about right so considerably over priced in todays free app market you would probably have more revenue in total by charging 5 euros
__label__3 critical
__label__2 removing features from the free version is not a good way to attract people to premium version and the price is way to high looking elsewhere
__label__4 great for to do's and keeping on track with schedules notifications need to be adjusted i don't always hear when they go off and sometimes miss my stuff
__label__2 it doesn't work well as a calander or any type of memo for me i also didn't like the type of layout design they made it didn't fit with what the purpose of this app was said to do
__label__2 i don't know why but the app isn't supporting my phone it was good till 2 days and later on it stopped responding but i do appreciate the thought you have put behind it
__label__3 in beta test have a many bug for example when i starts my day in my hp is lost i die agian and agian i lost my exp i lost my sword
__label__4 this is helpful for accountability
__label__2 cant really set custom remindere for example i need to be able to check a specific system every 3 hours with other variables cant do it
__label__2 great app alas i'm constantly reminded that hey btw there's a paid version which has the functionality you're looking for this is tiresome and the subscription based model just doesn't make any sense plus hey its expensive
__label__5 very useful one can make tasks repeat and rank them based on priority
__label__1 super buggy on android have to close and open constantly for anything to work
__label__1 horrible now was good to start but now that my subscription expires december 1 cannot even accomplish a simple thing like removing tags from task names very disappointed
__label__1 ads started appearing whenever i'd modify something not cool edit i have no problems with banner ads but ads that completely disable functionality for a period of time completely defeats the purpose of using this app for better functionality
__label__3 functional not beautiful nothing particularly advantageous compared to other calendar apps
__label__4 very user friendly easy to use and well designed app to keep track of all your tasks lists too bad the premium version is so expensive
__label__3 please add app option to put new task at the top of the list for those that are coming from wunderlist
__label__2 convoluted way of editing sub tasks and the undo button only works in te immediate moment after checking stats can't be reset all the little thingd take a long time to set up due to the way interface is handled it's also weird how 'done' can't be hidden
__label__5 very nice app
__label__3 not sure yet about other features but definitely need the ability to access the full app from the widget
__label__3 like the concept but tech support cannot get rid of ads and popups tried over several months but they are gone a short while then return the response lag and language issues are frustrating this changed my review and i removed the app
__label__1 why you changed layout to old one its really bad and annoying
__label__2 it was okay but when i tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show that is extremely inconvenient and annoying i tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didn't work would have given five stars if it wasn't for this issue
__label__2 cant complete subtasks through widget huge turn off
__label__5 my dày
__label__5 very nice agenda widget also supports basic ics import saved me a couple of times had some problems deleting tasks but might have been a glitch of my phone but the look is great one of the best out there
__label__3 i just got the app but i can barely use it because every time i click on something it redirects me to a page that asks me to upgrade for 4 99 yr if it would just let me use the free version i might actually like it
__label__4 just after i looked at the interface i knew it was what i was searching not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books for anyone who think in terms of goals and obviously who love rpgs it's totally free though
__label__3 it miss my data after updating i can't use it easily
__label__4 just installed this app it is easy to use and is quite beautiful i would love to have a vision board feature page that i can put pics and maybe a daily quote feature spiritual before jumping to premium please
__label__3 great app still testing it out so will come back with better rating from last time i used it it worked perfectly no issues second time around should be interesting
__label__3 very helpful with lots of features i would like to see the countdown mode work on the widget too though also it would be delightful if we could add tasks like the notification with a button shortcut such as pressing the home button for some time and the prompt would pop up but still nothing i would pay annually though
__label__4 very useful app
__label__3 nice but not what i need for now
__label__5 started 2 days ago learned to add new tasks it's a good little way to push your will
__label__4 the ideal task mamager for me perfect combination of ability to customize tasks design and great for team work still would be better if tasks added to my lists wouldn't automatically add to all tasks where today tomorrow etc sections are sometimes i need them to keep in my lists and not be added to lists with some time attachment if possible i am your fan forever
__label__3 this is a very cool app and thus have the ratings how ever it will be nice if you can add the functionality of sharing task or even with other users this will make it the all in one project task manager review update previously i was able to pick custom tags when setting a new event but now i can't and i have to pick a color and look for the same icon each time i want to create a new event this is counter productive as the main aim of the app is to help optimize time please fix this
__label__3 widget not making full use of size
__label__1 didn't like navigation menu location update
__label__2 easy to use but do not always follow md2 it's damaging our brains
__label__4 please add a feature like task has to be divided based on categories inside planned and importent list
__label__1 i just bought pro on my tablet 15 minutes ago and then installed sectograph on my phone and it says i have to buy pro again what the heck happened with syncing google accounts
__label__1 it was confusing
__label__3 near to ideal but there is some shortage for example there is no option in settings to add planned tasks to my day automatically or people usually plan tonight for tomorrow but when i at the end of the they add tasks to my day they add to today not tomorrow there is must be an optional boundary time in settings that determine the end of day and after that adding tasks to my day go to tomorrow another thing i cant add step s to my day its important
__label__1 find a new app overall if you havent noticed the dev's left this app as of recently the servers are dead this means you cant make an account forums are gone motivation pictures gone etc find a new app
__label__3 generally very good i have a few problems when i use it for reminders working out what i need to write for a week of reminders in 10 days time is a bit challenging
__label__5 awesome simple and easy to use
__label__3 this is a re review this could be the best habit tracker goal setter and task manager with some really great features like nested lists and smart auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup just don't confuse the 'game' in rpg for any actual gameplay but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system that deserves recognition allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life however do it now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups after a solid month of use building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks and setting up several habit based routines the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next while auto grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared once again losing the important ones in the clutter user defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series with no social aspect currently attached to the app as at ver 2 23 0 there is no task sharing there is also no designated pc mac linux front end for desktop syncing finally it's expensive as apps go a one off of 75 will get the full version or about 2 50 a month paid yearly which removes ads and gives calendar access original review a good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy it would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader
__label__3 i am so confused
__label__2 i was trying out the routine trick i set the times and dates but it just wouldn't work please help
__label__4 add how long it takes to do a task instead of what time i should do the task
__label__5 love it a scheduling app that doesn't force me to sync my google calendar with it i downloaded 5 different apps that all did and it was so incredibly frustrating i deleted them all right away and finally found what i was looking for i use my google calendar to keep track of bills and things like that and those calendars have national holidays and other stuff i just don't want mixed in with my day to day sched i wanted a blank calendar app to schedule things it was surprsingly hard to find
__label__5 very quickly
__label__2 couldn't get the rest of my calendars to appear feedback help wasn't clear as well uninstalling
__label__1 this app is bullocks i downloaded it and it ran smoothly on my phone and i setup my avatar my habits and my daily task and then it just stopped working and couldn't open the app again
__label__2 the widget doesn't auto update after i add an event always need to click the manual refresh button same goes for when i delete an event
__label__1 terrible moderator community anti religious reply i've already had numerous interactions with habatica mods and i've no desire to reply further when i questioned why the website had an anti christian stance i was banned nothing more needs to be said
__label__4 i have found this app helps me stick to my daily schedule
__label__1 i buy pro version but it features are not given to me
__label__2 i was recommended this app by a friend who loves it i got the premium version as i expected it to have better features this app is very confusing to use i even went to the help section and was even more confused i'm very disappointed
__label__5 i've never been able to stick to using a to do list until now great interface and features
__label__3 i can't figure out how to make it work on my s2 watch there are no clear instructions
__label__3 i downloaded s graph but i do not have any widgets with it i have google calendar i can open the app but there is no home screen widget any way i can fix that i have a samsung s6 active thanks a lot
__label__5 very good tool to organize my days thank
__label__4 it's easy smooth and fast
__label__4 so far the best planner app i ever come across room for improvement i e to be accessible on pc as if some other app does
__label__5 very nice app i like the fact i am able to log in any type of event in the calender and track your progress
__label__4 reall well
__label__5 very useful
__label__4 it's not as straight forward as others but i like the many color options i have a task that is a grocery list so it is lengthy in moving from list to list i have accidentally removed items i don't see an undo
__label__4 a good way to manage my busy schedule i particularly like having a separate task bar but would so like to be able to delete or adjust one of todays events without deleting changing all upcoming ones
__label__5 works great keeps me focused and off my phone i've tried many different apps like this before and deleted them because they didn't work how i wanted to or they put ads on my homescreen but this is app doesn't do that and this is the best one around for sure
__label__3 it doesnt update between your calanders i need a planner that stays up to date with my calendar changes this is not it waste of money
__label__1 sorry no more wunderlist looks like you're just going to have to switch over to this new platform that demands a microsoft account like seriously who tf actually wants to use a microsoft account especially on mobile screw you guys
__label__1 couldn't figure out
__label__4 i have only been using the app for a short period of time so far it has been a great tool the bility to addnsubtask to a task is very helpful great job
__label__3 drag and drop task is not working tasks disappear while dropping
__label__2 actually it is a good calendar app but on android 10 google calendars cannot be synched without the google calendar app installed on your device you have to sync your calendar by another calendar app or all your bc2 events will stay on your local device only so this means that another calendar app is required to use this calendar app which makes this app useless at the moment i am waiting for a fix
__label__2 i'd like to know how to create home screen widgets
__label__5 is there any way to link the planner with your laptop if my phone breaks or is lost will i lose everything in the planner
__label__3 average features
__label__3 to finish scheduling a task you must click a small arrow in the top left corner clearly the development team never tested this becsuse it feels horrible
__label__4 forest is a gamification of the pomodoro technique it's more helpful than other pomodoro type apps the vibration notification is too long and loud otherwise an excellent app
__label__1 if you pay for premium you won't actually get the premium services as other reviewers have noted troubleshooting steps from their site don't work and no one responds to the support email contact google and they'll reject your refund request
__label__5 excelentes
__label__5 best to do app i have used it offers most of the features that other similar apps also offer in a very simple user intefface organize your tasks into lists use tags create smart lists use two way sync with google calendar finally what makes it excel over the competitors for me is that it also works as a daily weekly planner since the calendar view allows to drag and drop pending tasks into the day week and also schedule start and end times for each task
__label__1 awful graphics idea ia great but the graphics need a major update can't tell the different between anything in this game overall disappointed
__label__1 i did the free trial and canceled this service they charged me anyway not giving me any way to contact the company or get my money back these people are rip offs i didn't even use their crappy app
__label__1 please fixed it why i can't login my passcode damnly alot of doc i ve save inside
__label__2 super glitchy too frustrating to bother trying to use it
__label__2 there is a subscription to the service i wish i would have knownbefore i downloaded looks beautiful though
__label__3 i had the free version and enjoyed it but since i have bought the premium version i have not been able to buy new trees a message reads push plantboost token error 404 or 422 and it remains on the screen even if i leave forest not glad about that really
__label__2 it would be a great app if it had an option to use it without syncing it to your calendar like timetune i don't want all my tasks to show up on my calendar and their solution wasn't working
__label__5 i've been using this app for a week and so far it is great it has really helped me hold myself accountable for habits that i want to break or start way better than i thought i never end up liking self help apps i also never write reviews give the one a chance
__label__5 so nice my hearth of friend
__label__3 hi i have been using this app for a number of years right from the first business calendar app the best feature i like is the management of reminders where the reminders stay on even after the event end time till is dismissed manually however since i have upgraded to s10 the reminders are automatically removed after the end time no change in settings has made any difference unfortunately queries to the support team hasn't helped such a shame update switched to acalendar app which works
__label__2 24 hrs shouldn't be extra cost can't import from my google calendar and too many left and right arrows confusing too few colours for the sectors
__label__1 my prior app isnt any more and they automatically imported all content into this one the most annoying part is that each item now adds to the bottom of the list instead of the beginning i need to fiddle with sorting on each list to fix this and the sorting takes space on the screen waste of time each time
__label__2 have been a user for years but the app is borderline unusable at this point it's not saving anything and is not connecting to servers tried uninstalling and reinstalling not sure what's wrong
__label__5 as someone with chronic forgetfulness the intrusive overlay and mediative periods to plan needed tasks are a godsend
__label__1 i downloaded it and login with google i never did anything just logged in with google it has asking me many time for auto debit for subscription so i uninstalled it but still 5 min before rs 909 debited from my account this is the muging of money i want refund my money in my account kindly
__label__4 if only the authors would fix the issue with the wrong person displayed after clicking on the birthday box i would consider paying for the premium version
__label__3 everything is good my only issue is that it doesn't send the message to you the exact moment you assigned it eg i set a reminder at 8pm the bot only whatsapped me 15mins later other than this everything else is good love the feature of a whatsapp reminder bot improve on this area and you'll earn 1 more loyal customer
__label__1 terrible i am missing wunderlist after importing our tasks everything got mixed and doubled shared people and list owners mixed double blame on your engineering and programming i̇ will miss my lovely wunderlist
__label__3 i really like this app and find it useful for keeping me on track simple but effective i used the free version for almost 2 years at the end of the first year it reset and i lost all of my history so before the end of the second year i bought the premium version and promptly lost all of my history again i contacted support to see if they could help and got no response at all i still recommend it for tracking your habits but don't expect to keep the info long term or get help if you need it
__label__5 i like it
__label__4 nice will be better if app has got inhabit counter for example count of pushups or exercise i need it but app is very nice i will be recommend it
__label__4 it has been an effective motivator and tracker for me to accomplish the smaller tasks that get me closer towards my bigger goals but there seems to be a bug i can't seem to receive a friend's party invite though i am able to create my own party and invite friends to it it's a one way street in my app joining guilds and the self care self sabotage info have been most educational and helpful
__label__4 i am the most unorganized person ever and this app has helped me a lot i constantly put down when my projects tests etc are due i even include my days off on it i also love that you can not down little notes with this app as well
__label__3 really a good app but needs development i in daily reoccurring tasks need options to schedule on weekdays ii also need help in scheduling weekly tasks in alternative weeks
__label__4 why can i see and create task lists from only one account i have 3 google accounts on my phone only one of them are in the tasks list
__label__5 apresenta problemas de autenticacao direto e o pior qd desinstalei o programa e o reinstalei na tentativa de conseguir autenticar e logar na conta perdi todas as minhas informacoes anteriores ja q a unica alternativa de importacao que eu tive era a do wunderlist nao a da conta da microsoft salva na internet
__label__4 like
__label__2 liked the prioritization by dragging and the highlighting but there does not seem to be a way to create recurring tasks that's a deal breaker for me i'm uninstalling
__label__4 i'm not sure but i keep getting these little hidden files in download folder but i believe they're from the calendar i haven't checked since the update but i do use this app every day especially for the widgets and the customization you can get lost in it but i'd rather have the option than not
__label__2 missing everything good about gtasks and adds everything you hate about every other task list app
__label__2 i'd like to know how to create home screen widgets
__label__1 this was a great app but it hasn't been updated since 2018 and sadly it be can become unusable in an instant with no fixes in sight i cannot recommend this app i would try something similar maybe open sources or with dev support
__label__4 really just started using this app seems pretty good but way early days to rate beyond 4 even if it does deserve it
__label__5 super easy to use amazing interface great for anyone who likes to stay organized
__label__2 widget constantly breaking not updating and showing a loading icon at bottom defeats the entire point of having a widget easily viewable
__label__5 if you're a procrastinator this app will change your life i have a tendency to avoid the things i need to do by snacking or playing video games so this app has been perfect for me i'm great at making to do lists but suck at execution this app has helped me with so many areas of my life chores around the house my quality of work at my job i've even been using it to develop safer driving habits the community is also very supportive it's really fun to play with a friend and party up
__label__2 good the only thing it has that isn't on my samsung cal is agenda view crappy my scal has dark mode buscal you can basically f off if you're vision impaired font size dark mode are paid only not fun to test drive in the bright white light uninstall
__label__5 very cool app using it for real life stuff as if it's a video game is so fun could have some bug tweaks and possibly an overhaul for the interface but it's still close to perfect and runs great
__label__5 brilliant and incredible app it turns my daily life into enjoyable one with simple rpg concept love it
__label__1 can't turn on the whitelist unless i unlock the pro version i dont wanna waste money for that uninstalled
__label__4 nice
__label__3 hi thanks for responding and i'll be more specific please bring back the pretty orange background for the top bar and each of the routines the current color is too pale
__label__1 stupid app even a reminder which is pretty much basic is under premium useless don't waste time in exploring this just go to any other nice applications
__label__5 great app i love how well thought ux it has thanks to the free month to try it i could really try if the app is good for me and now i am happy premium customer because it is by far the best app for todos i am using it for my a bit enhanced gtd and my productivity has actually skyrocketed ever since i use todoist
__label__5 great experience it would be great if it has some rotation feature so that we can rotate the wheel and it shows the task as per indicated position thanks
__label__1 the app is running while i type this review meaning i am able to just leave the app and do something else without my tree dying just spent 45 minutes trying to set up the app which is ridiculous i tried to follow the instructions but they were really outdated and the settings don't operate like that anymore it doesn't work at all
__label__2 the changes made to how completed task are handled are not only bad ux but they introduced many quite critical bugs please fix
__label__3 some privacy please why do you millennials think everything needs to be shared why can't i keep my activity private without sharing with entire world
__label__3 this app stops the alarm i set after the while and then this is the 3rd time this has happened otherwise it's the best
__label__4 love this app i use it daily and it's an important part of my planning the only thing i think would make it 5 star to me personally would be the ability to create seperate lists so that i can have 1 personal widget and 1 work widget at the moment i can only create widgets using the same list
__label__5 such an awesome and amazing aap it forced me to install it again i wish it had 10 stars it's truly awesome very helpful and very admiring thanks to the creator of this app i'm able to do my schedule daily on time and yes i'm becoming more organized thank u
__label__1 if you love complex chronographs and a tiny slice of color tells you all then this app is for you this is not a user friendly interface does not play well with 9 0 pie but not much does
__label__3 i really like this however i'm not able to stay with it for long periods of time this one and others i've tried and i just can't stay motivated
__label__2 why is it so fiddly to get items to abutt next to each other i end up entering the time manually
__label__5 great app easy to use and keeps us all in sync with our tasks at work
__label__3 it's really only useful if you are doing recurring tasks at the same time on the same days etc i set up a lot of tags categories but they can only be applied to the routines not events or reminders i was also not able to copy duplicate events which would have allowed me to reuse the same tasks at different times or days without setting up a brand new event disappointed in the app's scheduling capabilities
__label__2 i installed because of the option to synch tasks but that is one of the features that unlocks for 4 99 yr no issues paying it if i liked the feature but with no chance to try out the one reason i download the app i uninstalled immediately
__label__1 terrible won't sync utterly disastrous transfer from wunderlist gutted that wunderlist is going and being replaced by something so inferior will have to look for a new list app now
__label__4 i think it's pretty cool how this app communicate with the calender smart watch greatly enhanced the experience as well good job i just wish there was a galaxy watch version of it
__label__3 practical and easy to use
__label__3 love this app its helped me with my motivation and procrastinating i've been more motivated since using it but i'm having a very frustrating issue that is driving my ocd insane i try to move a task in my list only for it to disappear or move itself somewhere i didn't tell it to go i try to keep my list in a certain order of how i should get things done and this is not helping me at all
__label__3 its a nice app liked the design also no option to copy paste same schedule to next day
__label__4 pretty easy to use and reliable still trying to figure out the ins and outs but it's been fairly easy to pick up
__label__5 love it just need to use it more often
__label__4 i'd like to see an option to mark parts of my routine as complete
__label__1 so disappointing i used to love this app bit over the last few months it is sooooooo glitchy i just spent an hour deleting and checking off tasks from my to do list and everytime i think im done they show back up in triplicate everything i changed is still there after an hour does that sound like a good time management program and no way to contact support because when i try to get to the menu it shows a black screen
__label__3 i'm using this app for quite some time it has big problems which forcing me look for another app it doesn't remind me on time all the reminders work when i open this app at that time it was too late what the use having this app please correct this problem or else i am happy the all the options and features thank you
__label__4 thank you for responding and i'm looking forward to that update customized categories another improvement i'd love to see are more options for a goal besides a daily one such as save 100 per week etc i got the premium and love the dark theme this app is the best i've found for my needs thank you
__label__2 claims syncing but it always fails to sync lost all data when got new phone donwgrading to two stars
__label__3 this is good but you need to update where we can sync on our desktop or another phone via google or else
__label__4 so far so good you have to be willing to set on the app for a bit to figure it out it's a rpg game based off of truth the app does freeze fairly frequently but you just have to close it and reopen it and everything is back in order
__label__1 it's useful i wasn't sure how good it'd be at keeping me focused but it really does help and it shows me how much i use my phone also the gardens are quite pretty i would like more realistic varieties of plants and for it to not be so expensive to plant real trees though seems fitting to be able to plant trees in real life with every tree you plant i'd be much more willing to recommend this app to people if i could plant a real tree with every full tree i plant in the app
__label__4 awesome app to keep your life on track would 5 star but app crashes every time i try and add a custoum sound edit thank you will try again after the next update
__label__5 dari beberapa aplikasi untuk list kerjaan ini yg terbaik wajib punya aplikasi ini
__label__1 help the widgets are not working it always shows this message failed to display your tasks please restart app or add a new widget instead
__label__3 great but why i'm able to open and prolong operate any app immediately after assigning timer then after using 3 to 4 apps forest gets to know that i'm using other apps and reminds me about my distraction so late please fix this problem otherwise it's a great application for controling phone distraction
__label__2 great app but it just syncs to my google calendar making it redundant i wanted to use this for nonpersonal task and keep it separated while using the app i get 40 notifications because it updates my personal calendar as well i gave 2 stars because otherwise the functionality and ui is really nice
__label__5 have been using this since 15 days a must have app those who focus on being productive everyday habit tracker is a big plus kudos to the team
__label__3 it's good but complicated a bit
__label__3 great format and tracking 7 seems excessive for upgrade feature to use as a widget also people have a form of spirituality rather than a religion can that not be reflected in the app too for inclusivity removing forum comments would be a great option an unnecessary distraction
__label__3 good so far only used a few times may review later on
__label__3 good app but need improvement
__label__1 wunderlist was better microsoft bought it and killed it first microsoft forced me to switch apps now i have to have two accounts since i have lists at both home and work that i share with others pretty dumb otherwise the app is wunderlist waste of time to have to redo everything
__label__1 cannot access the app
__label__5 very helpful
__label__2 loved it but its freezing and wond even start the clock when i push it after 160 hours of usage in total
__label__3 app idea and design is great but it is not possible to add calendar from work profile account anyhow it is just invisible android 7 1 1 promise rating 5 if fixed upd thanks for prompt reply but it is about google calendar in work profile it creates a separate copies of google apps for it please have a look at work profile specifics for android 7
__label__3 first impression is sufficient but not excellent there are no settings for applying priorities to tasks and i couldn't find also a setting for repeating tasks daily or for certain periods for specified hours from 17 00 20 00
__label__2 would agree that it isnt very user friendly functions seem complicated and too basic at the same time
__label__2 it used to be a slick minimal app that did what it needed to then they kept adding layers of unneeded features and forced people to make an account just to use it no thanks
__label__4 really great app love being able to visualise my day but it would be fantastic if the app and widget could now sync with the systemwide dark mode on android 10
__label__1 has something wrong it takes the routine i created for one day and do it for all days
__label__2 in my last phone asus zenfone c i can use this app well but after i changed my phone to samsung j7 2016 it automatically connects with either samsung or google calendar where i can't edit the event colors freely on the clock i'm very disappointed so i had to uninstall sorry
__label__4 i want to love this more but i m not heaps impressed that dark mode is free and native on ios but not on android i use my devices a lot later at night and it would really help if this app would keep the dark theme the rest of my apps generally manage to keep it s also the one constant notification that annoys the pants off me as it is bright white against the dark screen
__label__3 not quite what i need otherwise looks like a decent app
__label__1 could you make an option to not stop the trial because i dont think some people want to do the trial and it doesn't mention that before you download the app and when you do you guys get paid
__label__2 update on oct 29 the new update with sections and the new ux design is a real drop of usability in my case my day to day work force me to constantly change priority project and other properties and with the new version the natural language as been removed when editing a task i will strongly consider not renewing my subscription because todoist was my workhorse because of that natural language original review it's my day to day to do application to drive all my tasks
__label__1 sync isn't working no response to emails no updates for ages
__label__1 subscription service to enable simple reminders is ridiculous i was willing to pay a one time fee for a solid app but having to pay nearly 5 per month just to enable reminders is absurd once i saw how many basic features were being kept behind a pay wall i had to stop using it
__label__2 slow updates bugs
__label__3 i have changed my mind and have bought the 24hr clock version once the app is fully updated and is working how i want it to use i will review accordingly i have gave 3 stars as it is the middle ground for now
__label__1 the app crashed when i raised the time limit to 3 hrs and listened to the forest sound while studying after that i wasn't even able to open the app again need assistance dev
__label__1 doesn't work in my country i have to use a vpn for it to work which sucks of course syrian arab republic
__label__4 very good how about a tutorial about making best use of ticktick
__label__4 love the organization so far super easy to use even in comparison to other apps like this would make one change i would like to be able to click on a specific individual time date block on the single day 3 day week calendar set up to add a specific event task to that individual date time block
__label__3 there's a visible lag when scrolling left or right in day view even in high end phones going back from a task edit screen without making any changes also asks shows popup whether you wish to save or discard changes that popup is irritating otherwise an effective and the point app cheers
__label__1 too many long ads
__label__2 incredible tool awful app i'd recommend the desktop version of this site to anyone but the app is a bug ridden mess that overcomplicates simple functions and only works about 90 of the time
__label__3 notification does not sound pls develop why can not be set for 6 days in a routine week please like this
__label__3 i paid for the premium version but all my habits records was deleted without explanation they fix that problem
__label__4 good app looses my long term appointments now and then
__label__3 it's a pretty good app but its has a serious glitch the goal day isn't functioning properly no matter which goal date you set it will always be the same day you created the task like you finished today
__label__3 please make offline version because most of studious people cannot afford online apps so if you want good ratting please make part 2 offline
__label__5 really helps me keep my projects in order i always have 10 15 construction jobs going at one time being able to walk in a house and making my list by project with reminders and emails is awesome
__label__4 no issues so far integrates nicely with all the software i use
__label__3 any chance of getting a widget for the calendar
__label__3 this is a good app
__label__3 it would be motivational for me if i can set the start date of my goals
__label__2 i found this difficult to use due to navigation love the home screen but its impossible to get back to it also the nonstop full screen ad to buy the app yearly is so annoying that alone makes it unusable if you make my free experience terrible why would i want to pay you
__label__1 i cannot change the order of dailies which is frustrating since normally i would like to have them in chronological order
__label__3 no auto custom tags really
__label__4 this app is awesome could use better graphics but overall the idea of it is legit af
__label__3 force closes when trying to create challenge
__label__4 i really like it
__label__5 luv it
__label__2 pain ya have to create an account to access
__label__3 no option to set daily tasks as only monday to friday
__label__3 achievements are not loading anymore
__label__3 what i am missing the most is that i can t open it directly in web browser just with my login without installing anything in big industry companies is not alowed to install anything what is not fully authorized by central it department i used wunderlist in my browser app in chrome was possible to install without any permission but i can t use it now in my work browser just in my private smartphone by transferring wunderlist tasks some old and completed tasks are transferred as uncompleted so 3 stars for now
__label__3 why weekend just 2 days on sat sun but my weekend is on friday only
__label__3 its refusing to open on a daily basis now downloading it over and over is not fun any suggestions forest has really helped me in keeping distractions to a minimum and maintaining focus update i'm still facing the same issue help a girl out
__label__4 great but confusing when starting ro to use it
__label__1 confusing and definitely didn't motivate me to do tasks just spent hours trying to figure out how to add personalized tasks
__label__3 it keeps crashing just when i paid premium devs pls help me i really wanna use this app as soon as i open it it crashes and end abruptly i am hoping for your quick response thank you
__label__4 i have been using habitica for quite some time now and i must say it has been the most useful in helping me establish a structure to my day however the to dos are very limited in its functions it's hard to implement a full task management such as gtd methodology it pretty much only supports next action steps not any layers such as projects or waiting for also syncing across devices can sometimes be problematic i hope they will improve the to dos and make syncing smoother
__label__3 a nice userfriendly application to organise our to dos and reminders but please try to add a seperate smart list and a widget called today and week too to view all our to dos and reminders with today as due date this is available in wunderlist because of this one feature i would prefer wunderlist when compared to microsoft to do
__label__5 great job
__label__1 i hated that you cannot edit certain things for example when you go to make a schedule there's no option to delete blank slots no obvious anyway
__label__5 helps keep me organized
__label__1 can only track five habits without premium five habits i can just write down in a notebook instead of waiting my time with this app i wanted to use it to build good habits for 2019 but i'm not gonna pay money to do something i can do with a pen and paper
__label__5 love this this is a fun way to build your self up
__label__4 please update the sorting algorithm to sort by due date including the reminder time in the to do so i can see in a day which to do comes first on top of the list and also pls make the planned section sortable as it's only sorted alphabetically i want to sort by due date including the to do reminder time
__label__3 lot of difficult methods to organize
__label__4 absolutely a great app it helps my family to keep track on our activities and also for my work nice design and very practical
__label__3 still trying to learn how to use the app i'm going to go on youtube for some help
__label__3 useless unless it gets updated so we can use it offline as well the best time i have for updating it is en route to from uni and i can't do that without internet otherwise it would have been a bomb app
__label__3 cool platform
__label__3 i love the idea of the app cantake a minute to figure out wish it had its own calander or was able to sync with others other than google calendar
__label__1 way too overpriced 60 per year lol
__label__3 missing key features cross platform
__label__3 this could be the best planner app out there but there are some questions i've not had answered because inquiries to the developer were unanswered such as can tasks be set to repeat ie daily weekly etc maybe that is in the paid version i don't know the tasks are separated and i'm not sure i can see all of them at the same time i'd also like to know if it can sync between android note 4 and ipad for now i am using opus domini on ios but it is unavailable on android still searching
__label__3 hi please provide accepted pending decline tags on rutine notifications of activites and also show day progress for these tags or activites in app i think it will force the mind to follow daily schedule
__label__1 can't sign in and there are reviews from october saying the same so no improvement over months of having the same issue
__label__3 the only thing not working is the reminder i'm using huawei mate8 can somebody help me how
__label__5 simple yet effective pro version is cheap and awesome
__label__1 worst app doesn't work
__label__1 not impressed considering the size of the owner loses entire days worth of data if refreshed as prompted to apply update shows lists differently on mobile app can't order some lists painfully slow to sync between devices when compared to any checklist app available annoyed since i switched from wunderlist when microsoft started ruining it
__label__3 the app is good but a faq would be appreciated for example i cannot find out how to create a group for my tasks
__label__2 you asked me to pay premium version but instant google calendar sync still doesn't work needs few hours for tasks to sync this been an issue for years already and you ignore pleas from users on the other hand the gtasks app you have works really great
__label__5 finally something that lets me feel like i'm using a paper planner but i don't accidentally leave it at home
__label__3 al migrar de wunderlist encontré varios elementos 1 en las listas compartidas se duplicaron las tareas 2 en el widget no hay indicador de tareas vencidas en wunderlist se mostraba la fecha en rojo esto último sí se muestra en to do pero dentro de la aplicación y no en el widget ese indicador visual hace falta 3 hay mayor configuración del widget de wunderlist 4 las tareas vencidas de la lista planned no se muestran organizadas por fecha de vencimiento aún no me voy a pasar a to do
__label__4 great app keeps me on track and efficient helps me stick to my new year's goals just wish we could add more habits
__label__2 good idea bad execution the first screen with the customkze character options wouldn't let me pick anything therefore i couldn't move on
__label__5 actually a very handy app to use for agenda views however what i would love to see is an option to have the agenda filter on the widget not a complaint more just a suggestion for improvement
__label__2 needs a vpn if you're in china some questionable ui and design choices though the fundamentals work well for the most part if you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay of course and the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate one month is the same price as a month of netflix and a year is 47 a year of ms office 365 with all of its functionality is 60 let that sink in i don't understand why for relatively little this app costs so much greed i assume
__label__3 good
__label__2 many times i've put sub tasks on my to do tasks and they just disappear for some reason i've forgotten many things because of this and still hasn't been fixed despite various updates
__label__5 i love this app is very simple to use yoh can set the time for reminders is not annoying and i totally recommend to use it the only thing i would like to improve is to put first the task you havend comple
__label__3 i just downloaded installed this app i was in search of an app that allows me to insert date and time stamp preferably using a button on the screen this way i can time stamp different sections in my notes and activities however i didn't find that feature would love to see that in this app as it needs quite a few of my requirements
__label__1 after installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls after removing the app from my phone i received fewer spam calls it might be a coincidence but it might not be
__label__1 it's too difficult to understand
__label__2 i tried to explore it a little after downloading i want something that will show me everything planned on the day i have notes on rather than me having to search if i do i tend to forget due to busy schedules i want automatic pop up i'll keep playing with it but so far dislike
__label__5 brilliant app all you need to keep on top of things one thing i would add the ability to delete bulk tasks
__label__1 i understand the need to play ads in a free version but your ads are going for 30 seconds before you can get rid of them which makes this app unusable
__label__2 i'm a pro user worked great initially but it is not opening and continuously stopping please fix this asap
__label__5 brilliant
__label__3 is there a way to get my money back i don't like this app as much as a few others i have
__label__4 repetition should not be a premium function
__label__2 missing grocery list widget and quantity for grocery list items
__label__4 ticktick has much better widget customization
__label__4 hi team i paid for pro version but ended up rebooting my phone now it is asking me to pay again how can i get my pro access again i paid for it on march 16 2020
__label__1 don't bother with this planner app there are lots of other apps that do the same thing this app has intrusive ads thats pop up at random if you close the app and open a different app planner pro will open a pop up on the new app your using seriously don't even bother with this bs
__label__4 could you allow me to add activities on my timeline because my routine and plan is always changing and cannot be limited to a fixed routine i use this as a daily planner to plan out my full days and weeks ahead of time so it would be good if i can add activities far ahead of time
__label__3 it says i changed my password and now can't get in calendar what can i do to fix problems
__label__4 interesting concept still getting used to the functionality but this app is an effective way to gamify your to do and task lists before do it now rpg i had a list of chores now i have a quest list instead time to go unlock some achievements
__label__3 not really what i was going for it's ok i guess if you want to use google or your phones calender but i wanted a detailed schedual with alarms to remind me to go to the next event love the look but not useful to me
__label__5 this app is exactly what i need to to be it helps me keep track of the habits i'm trying to establish without being too intrusive i've already recommended it to a number of my friends
__label__4 please add an option to update habit task status from the notification bar when i receive notification on the set time overall good app
__label__5 the best organizational app out there
__label__3 great app and so far no issues using it
__label__3 too many fake menu items in the free version all that items just ask you to buy the paid version
__label__5 what a genius game
__label__3 hi how can i get this app on my galaxy watch 46mm regards
__label__2 i just installed this app and it's always on landscape view please fix this soon thank you
__label__3 great app but it's not syncing properly please fix
__label__3 ok i guess
__label__1 very annoyed by the new time setting it's like going back to android 2 1
__label__2 it was good for a few days but now it's not loading on my browser at all gateway timeout and changes i made on my ipad are not syncing to my phone not useful if nothing works
__label__3 when trying to add from the widget it does not add to the selected list instead it adds to tasks very annoying this makes the widget borderline useless
__label__1 i just buy the premium but the app always crashed can't be open
__label__5 good
__label__5 really great since i had installed this application i can do my works on time and very well
__label__2 no longer able to add note to todoist quickly using google and note to self yes you can do it but it takes 60 seconds instead of 10 seconds not sure if this is a google change or a todoist change but it removes one of the most useful parts on todoist i am a long time premium user looking for another tool
__label__1 used to love it now it's been an issue after issue with this app you'd expect that it would perform at least the basic task of reading my calendars doesn't even do that anymore no matter how many times i try to sync it so much for getting the premium version disappointing
__label__3 i have been using this app for about a year now without any issues so i'm definitely not fond of the new routines menu i find that swiping from side to side for the days to be much easier and having the drag and drop feature to be more comfortable hope it will be implemented again soon also the fact that you can't move a blank time frame up and down makes it difficult to set up the routine as i have to change the time of every item to move it down i would prefer the old version hopefully it all gets fixed soon
__label__3 pretty decent to do app with probably the least annoyances of the very many i've tried over the years i'm yet to find my perfect match though the app sometimes require unnecessarily many taps to get something done it's easy enough to understand it's just not the smoothest user experience
__label__5 works pretty well and it's intuitive
__label__3 nice and useful app feels quite buggy though and the party chat goes the wrong way if you're used to any other chat app
__label__4 i just want to say that the tutorial was too much info things like this should be explained in a short and concise way at a good pace it was just too long and too much to take in i didn't even try the app though i can't say what rating it deserves i am unnistalling but i may come back to it in the future it's not you it's me also you can't delete your account on mobile but you can on desktop i suggest people to try the desktop version since it may have more features
__label__1 could be good if basic features like icons weren't locked behind a paid subscription update your calling themes an advanced feature because you want to not because it is one sorry but changing the background color to black which it should be in the first place isn't an advanced feature it's about one line of code i'm a software engineer myself and know the difference between the two same goes for icons which are essentially to app functionality check out notion for a great example
__label__1 alarms or notifications don't work unless you open the app then it floods all the notifications for the tasks as i open the app defeats the purpose of the app tedious round about way to delete a habit compared to deleting a task not sure how this app got a 4 6 rating
__label__4 please fix the alarm functionality it does not notify me in android 9 running asus zenfone max pro m1
__label__3 needs to give you the option of adding pictures when note taking if it had this option would be excellent otherwise not a bad app
__label__4 it's very simple to use i like that you can set as either a yes no habit or a rep like two times a day my only hangup would be that the free version only allows tracking for five habits but that can be a bonus if your just getting started you don't want to overwhelm yourself
__label__1 it's impossible to use this app at first when i choosed pink theme during onboarding the app ignored my choice then i filled it with all my tasks for two days but when i closed it and opened again the app asked me to sign up with google all my tasks were gone when i did it i m deeply disappointed
__label__4 the app worked better when it was wunderlist it often has problems syncing which is inconvenient for shared lists overall the features are really nice though
__label__3 worked great until the app started calling me pet names in the notifications i'm not trying to be catcalled by my phone and my natural reaction was to ignore it like i would anyone else who calls me sugar i have not formed the habits i wanted to as a result
__label__4 amazing functionality however i wish there was a guide for some of the more advanced features
__label__1 doesn't seem to work on op 6t can go through character creation but doesnt let me customize or select anything half of the ui shows up blank
__label__5 good optimization and beautiful widgets
__label__2 i couldn't sync this with my work email and doesn't seem to give me the option to
__label__4 the app version has so much more to improve aside from being buggy a lot of features are still missing compared tovthe web version four stars because it helps me nonetheless i wish the team best of luck and thank you for habitica
__label__2 free version is all you need paid version is overpriced and a waste of google credits
__label__4 very nice looking app for tracking habits and tasks have already replaced my old task app for habitnow glad you can purchase the premium version and not have to buy a subscription like many other apps are now doing i've been unable to figure out how to make tasks repeat and modify the schedule of existing habits if these capabilities don't exist would love to see these as improvements
__label__3 i'm unable to double my coins it is frustrating
__label__4 easy and usefully and helpfully
__label__5 good for making yourself checklists you can organize activity checklists like you can have a bigger checklists with sublists
__label__1 buggy as all hell the advertisement is right it gamifies tasks but that's it no tracking history of your habits inaccurate as all hell worst of all is you can't delete your account they'll forever keep your data i'm sure that's illegal in parts of this country and around the world definitely don't use your real email to sign up to test it out
__label__1 won't show events i add to it makes different events random flags or sectors for no particular reason really annoying
__label__3 need to improve it multiple tasks cannot be copied into a list user interface looks good
__label__3 its pretty neat but the feedback on the paid app is pretty poor
__label__2 kind of ha are to get the hang of maybe i'm just stupid idk but i never did figure it out
__label__1 app didn't sync at all i lost almost 6 months and it turned out all users had the same issue and requested a refund i need my money or solve it now this is cheating
__label__1 wow what a truly appauling downgrade from wunderlist cant give same top access to users doesnt update well i hate it and will look for an alternative
__label__5 i've always had such a hard time motivating myself to do things like chores this app has made such a difference it really gives me a sense of accountability highly recommend to anyone who just can't seem to get things done
__label__4 it's
__label__3 i suggest you add sub tasks feature
__label__3 1 i didn't get the desktop icon 2 we tried sharing for shopping but it didn't sync
"__label__1 used the trial but it consistently asks for a pin to open it i have no pin 
for it i have installed and uninstalled it multiple times with the same 
result if the free version doesn't work i won't be spending money on a 
full version"
__label__3 hi i like this app it could be better if the todo list's tasks were sorted by their deadline and also today's tasks had a different color and a reward could be a game which needs some coins to play them thank you
__label__2 cannot create new tags even deleted a few to test if it was because i had reached an undeclared quota
__label__1 can't log in the password input is shorter on the in app login than both the reset password field as well as the login form on web so my correct password is rejected
__label__5 im in love with this app simple to use beautiful layout and keep me on track
__label__3 would have given more stars if the add folder option was not removed from the original wunderlist to do list i also used to be able to take photos offline and they will be automatically uploaded when i'm online now i must be online to even use my camera i also do not like the idea that when you add a new note or something it stays at the bottom these notes should automatically move to the top like how it did in wunderlist otherwise the app is helpful for most of what i do
__label__3 this is a great app and would be 5 stars the reason it isn't the early reminder notifications stopped working for me at all they had been working fine then for no reason that i can find they stopped i've tried reinstalling the app but this didn't fix it i am getting a reminder at the time my tasks are set for or 3 4 minutes late though it's incredibly frustrating as this is the only app i've found that offers early reminders and i'm trying to use that to complete tasks on time
__label__3 i have recently upgrade the app to the pro version and i've got to say that while i enjoy the concept of forest through keeping the tree alive since the upgrade the app keeps crashing when i go to the store to unlock a new tree it come up with an 'error' message and when i want to plant a new tree once the timer is up i need to restart the app i didn't experience any problems as such before hand and while this app is up to date i'm not sure why i'm experiencing this problem
__label__5 i made a resolution to set better habits to steward my time and researched some options i found this through tim challies' recommendation from the book do more better productivity worksheet he also provided some helpful tips to setting up different tasks under projects and categorizing the roles responsibilities you have in your life which is ever changing i really like that i can set certain tasks to repeat daily or weekly and see the next 7 days ahead to plan out my day week
__label__2 hello team i am not able to set different colours for different sectors could you please help me show how its done i purchased your app in light that it will give me option for above
__label__4 just installed and am liking it so far i do wish there was a way to disable the quotes and better utilize that space to see more of my actual calendar also sub tasks would be very useful with those changes i might actually be able to downsize the apps i use
__label__5 this app is really helpful earlier i thought that to do list apps were useless and were a total waste of time but this app is a real time saver the reason is that earlier i had to think what i have to do and need to do in my mind but now i can write in my to do list and get stress free
__label__3 i wish i could use whitelist for free because i live in iran and can't pay for it
__label__3 it's a nice app it make my life displined
__label__4 it's super helpful but why do all the multiplayer functions suck or not exist on mobile edit i'd really like to do the missions and stuff but i'm not really in this for friends i'd like a way to find a group on mobile maybe a random matchup option
__label__3 i'm a premium user and i've bought it for about 3 weeks now however i've realized lately that although the timer records the amount if time i've focused the app doesnt record nor update my data for example in the friends page it always says that i've focused for 0 minutes when in reality it's a couple hundred minutes already please try to fix this problem thank you
__label__2 updated i want to love this but like others have said it doesn't work with all calendars as claimed to get outlook or any other calendar to work you have to have your calendar sync with google which not everyone wants or can do it also only works with google's smart watch not android wear os smart watches great look and idea but very limited by being google only
__label__3 good one
__label__1 it doesn't remind me i even forgot i still had it on my phone
__label__2 after reinstall data not recover while take backup google drive
__label__5 great job
__label__5 very useful for keeping myself accountable for daily tasks and goals that i want to accomplish
__label__1 sorry you have reached the use limit on subtasks upgrade now and add up to 199 subtasks per task are you serious guys pro version for more subtasks why 199 why not unlimited
"__label__3 i think it will be better when it has a circle on the background no need 
to open to see the timetable"
__label__2 no option for reminders it doesn't show reminders of my google calendar and i dont wanna create events for my daily habits lol
__label__2
__label__5 i love this app so much it has really helped me get into a morning and night time routine before i found this app i was always late for school and felt really unhealthy in myself but now i'm i'm always early for school and make sure i wake up every morning at the right time thank you to this app so much
__label__3 good app but at present unable to add additional attendees to events as it causes the app to crash also it would be good to filter lists appearing on the calendar
__label__3 love it simple to use
__label__4 very nice app it could use some more work but i like the color tags and the plan your day feature
__label__5 the perfect marriage of pen pixel if you love the features and visuals of a paper planner but stink at keeping up with it this is for you it allows me to sync to my google calendars color code switch an event from one google calendar to another which even google calendar won't let me do look at my schedule as a single day week or month without having to put items in 3 different places set and write down goals track water meal plan make lists check off tasks
__label__1 i used to love this now on my phone it's oddly presenting and tasks are worthless no syncing and just too much work seems to have been since last update support i was given was also unhelpful went into actual google calendar and realized it hadn't been syncing for 3 plus weeks uninstalled reinstalled half way working but now its showing i dont have premium wrong and wont let me access 6 hours now big pro' stamped across app we shall see how long until my next contact
__label__2 the app is great for the schedule but the tasks needs work i should be able to schedule something to repeat every day but it doesn't allow for that option and it doesn't always register the repeats had to pay for the yearly subscription to find out it doesnt even work stick with the free version least youre not wasting your money will have to try something else for my tasks and the developer doesn't care
__label__4 ui ux can be improved a bit more
__label__3 helps me to stay focused
__label__3 just one thing and i will definitely change to 5 stars make the 'quick add bar' easier to use just expand the letter 'add a task' in the notification bar or at least make it easier to reach when using one hand i'm right handed but the 'add a task' is located on the bottom left of the bar so it's hard to reach with a thumb please i believe it's not too much to ask for
__label__5 i like this app i downloaded a few to have a look and pick one and i went with this one i like the lay out and i just find it easy to follow l
__label__3 i luv it
__label__5 i love the drag and drop feature
